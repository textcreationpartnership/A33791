            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THere is nothing that does more ſcandalize and unſettle the Weak, nor tempt the Proud and Licentious to a profeſſed neglect of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than the many cauſleſs Diviſions which do ſometimes happen in the Church. And he is no live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Member of that Myſtical Body of Chriſt, that is not ſenſibly affected with the Fatal Conſequences of theſe things; and does not endeavor, what he Lawfully may, to do ſomething towards the healing of thoſe Wounds which have been made by the extreme Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity of ſome; and are ſtill kept Bleeding by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and cunning Artifice of others. For it is manifeſt enough, and cannot now be denied, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have always attempted to pull down the Church of <hi>England</hi> by pretended <hi>Proteſtant</hi> hands; and have made uſe of the facility of our Diſſenting Brethren to bring about their own Deſigns. I wiſh the eminent Danger
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:5"/> we have been brought into, would prevail with them at laſt to forbear to Batter and Undermine us, as they have done; when they cannot but ſee that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy is waiting all Opportunities, and ſtands ready to enter at thoſe Breaches which they are making. They might condemn the raſhneſs of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and lament it, it may be, when it would be too late, if they ſhould ſee <hi>Popery</hi> erected upon the ruins of that Church which they themſelves had overthrown. We know how reſtleſs and induſtrious the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction has always been; and the only viſible Security we have againſt the prevailing of it, lies in the firm <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion; and there is nothing wherein there is the leaſt probability that we can ever be all <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited,</hi> unleſs it be the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as it ſtands by Law eſtabliſhed, agreeable to the Rules of the Holy Goſpel, conſonant to the Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians; and not only Allowed, but highly Honored by all the Reformed Churches in the World. Here is a Point fixed in which we all may Center; whereas they that differ from us are not yet, and, it may be, never will be perfectly agreed upon their own New Models of Diſcipline and Government; neither can they find one Precept or Example in Scripture or Antiquity, for the Conſtituting any Church without an <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Power preſiding over it. And if any Party amongſt them could have that <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Church Government</hi> confirmed by Law, which they eſteem the moſt Apoſtolical; it is manifeſt from reaſon and experience, that it would be preſently Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by all the reſt, with no leſs Violence than ours is; and inſtead of putting an end to our Diviſions, would moſt certainly increaſe them. Therefore though they have all ſtill impoſed their ſeveral <hi>Forms,</hi> with the greateſt Rigor, wherever they have had the Power,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:5"/> or but the Hopes of it in their hands; yet that all Sorts of Diſſenters may be drawn into the Confederacy for the preſent, we hear now of nothing ſo much as <hi>the Miſchief of Impoſitions,</hi> and the Natural Right, and great Advantages of <hi>Toleration.</hi> Which is the very thing which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries have always aimed at; and ſeems to be one of the ſubtileſt parts of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot:</hi> As might be made out by divers undeniable Arguments; and appears ſufficiently from many of the Letters, Tryals, and Narratives that have been lately publiſhed: And it can be no wonder that they ſhould give their Cordial Aſſiſtance to ſuch a Deſign, which if it ſhould ever paſs into an Act, would reward their Diligence with a cheap and eaſie Victory. For they may plainly foreſee, that it would be ſo far from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> us, that it would undoubtedly break us in pieces by a Law. Now if <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be always neceſſary, upon the common Obligations of Chriſtianity, it will be much more ſo in the preſent Conjuncture; conſidering the ſtrength and incouragements that may be given to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Cauſe, by the continuance of our Diſſenſions: And if there be far greater hopes that we may at length, by the bleſſing of God, be ſooner <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> in the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than in any other; then it muſt needs be the greateſt Service that can be done to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, if we could all be perſwaded to joyn heartily in the Communion of that Church, that has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been, and ſtill is ſo great a Defence againſt the Errors and Superſtitions of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It would be an unpardonable Vanity to imagine that theſe ſhort Papers ſhould be able to effect, what ſo many Learned and Solid Treatiſes have not yet done. But I addreſs this little Eſſay only to thoſe that have not time to peruſe a larger Volume. I have been incouraged to this Undertaking by the Numbers of thoſe here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                           <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:6"/> that have ſeemed formerly to diſſent from us, who have lately joyned with us, not only in Prayer, but in the Holy Communion of the Bleſſed Body and Blood of Chriſt. And I hope that many more may be invited, and diſpoſed by their good Example, to receive the ſame Satisfaction that they have found. Theſe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come in will not ſtand in need of any farther Perſwaſion, but only that they would continue Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in that Communion they have now embraced. For if they ſhould leave us again, and return to their <hi>Separate</hi> Aſſemblies, they would ſeem by this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves. For if it were Lawful for them to Communicate with us once, it muſt be Lawful for them to do ſo ſtill; and they will not refuſe to ſubmit to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in all things that may Lawfully be done. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore ſee how they can avoid being ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if they ſhould forſake our Communion; for if they judge it Unlawful, they ſinned Wilfully when they entred into it; if they think it Lawful, they would then Sin in withdrawing from it; ſince it is injoyned by that Power which they confeſs they are bound to obey in Lawful things. If they ſhould ſay that they once thought it Unlawful, after that they judged it to be Lawful, and now conceive it Unlawful again: This ſtrange unſteadineſs in Opinion would look a great deal more like Humor than Judgment. And it might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion vehement Suſpicions in ſome, not otherwiſe very Cenſorious, that this Uncertainty proceeds not from Conſcience, but Deſign; and that all their Compliance was only to ſerve a preſent turn; to decline an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Cenſure, to keep a beneficial Place, or to be qualified for an Office in ſome great Corporation. Thus men might be apt enough to ſuſpect; but I am willing to believe any thing rather, than that they that have always made ſhew of ſo great a Tenderneſs, ſhould be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:6"/> guilty of ſo much Hypocriſie and Prophaneſs together, as to dare even to approach to the Lord's Table, (under great diſſatisfaction of mind, it may be) meerly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſome Secular end. But I hope their Behaviour for the future, will ſufficiently clear them from ſuch an imputation.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall therefore apply my ſelf only to thoſe that do ſtill forbear our Communion; and offer ſomething very briefly, which I conceive may be uſeful for the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their moſt known and ordinary Doubts; that as we do all profeſs the ſame Faith, we may all agree in the ſame way of Diſcipline, and Worſhip; and all become peaceable and orderly Members of the ſame Church. And for the obtaining this moſt Excellent end, Firſt, I ſhall deſire them impartially to conſider of ſome things that may incline them to be Peaceably minded, and tend to the removing of the general Prejudices they have unhappily conceived againſt the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Then I ſhall endeavor to give what ſatisfaction I can to the chief <hi>Objections</hi> againſt us, which they are wont to urge in Defence of the preſent <hi>Separation,</hi> And laſtly, I ſhall exhort them to a brotherly <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> upon ſuch Motives and Arguments as the Goſpel ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, and make for the Credit and Safety of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion.</p>
                        <p>The things that I would commend to their ſerious Conſideration, which may ſerve to diſpoſe them to <hi>Peace,</hi> and to remove the <hi>Prejudices</hi> they have taken up, are ſuch as theſe. In the firſt place, they ſhould be very careful that it be not any <hi>ſiniſter</hi> end, or corrupt <hi>Paſſion,</hi> that did either engage them in the <hi>Separation</hi> at the beginning, or provokes them now to continue in it. I do not mention this becauſe I know any one of our Diſſenting Brethren to be guilty of it; but becauſe it muſt be confeſſed that mens minds are too often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:7"/> by their carnal <hi>Intereſts</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> Theſe will be always mixing themſelves in all their Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; theſe do commonly blind and pervert their Judgments, and lead them into ten thouſand Errours. Theſe are the occaſion that Fancy ſometimes paſſes for Conſcience; that Melancholy Fumes are admired for Divine Inſpirations; and that the overflowing of our Gall is looked upon as pure Zeal. Theſe and the like are very dangerous and uſual Miſtakes, that do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proceed from the prevalency of our <hi>Paſſions.</hi> If therefore we do divide from a Church, it will moſt highly concern us to be very Cautious, that we be not acted by any ſuch Principle. For if we hope to Gain, and grow Rich by our Departure; if we are Aſhamed, or Scorn to retract the Opinions we have once Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; if we imagine we have more <hi>Light</hi> than the firſt Reformers, when indeed we are very Ignorant; if we cannot endure to be Oppoſed in any thing; if we Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and Repine at our Governors, when they require our Obedience where we are unwilling to pay it; theſe are ſigns that our <hi>Affections</hi> are turbulent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly; and while we are thus diſpoſed, we can never be aſſured but that Covetouſneſs, Pride, and Impatience, might be the greateſt Motives that induced us to make a <hi>Separation,</hi> and the ſtrongeſt Arguments that we have to maintain it. But I cannot charge our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with theſe things; I believe that many of them may be Upright and Sincere in their Intentions. But becauſe they are all in the ſame eſtate of Degeneracy and Corruption which others are, I would intreat them to be very careful that they be never led away by theſe, or the like temptations; but that they would always labor to preſerve thoſe holy Diſpoſitions of Integrity, Meekneſs, Humility and Condeſcenſion, which are the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:7"/> beſt Preparatives to the <hi>receiving of the Truth in the Love of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After they have thus freed their minds from all irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Deſigns,</hi> it would conduce exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the PEACE of the Church, if they would be ſure to expreſs their greateſt Care and Concern in the more <hi>Weighty</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial</hi> things of Religion. This would prevent many of the Quarrels that do often ariſe in matters but of ſmall Importance. If real Holineſs and Piety be the thing that we aim at, then when we may be ſecured of this, we ſhould not be ſo very forward to enter upon fierce and endleſs Diſputes, about the external Modes and Circumſtances of Worſhip. If I may ſerve God there in Spirit and in Truth, why ſhould a Gown, or a Cloak, or a Surplice fright me from the Church, when either of theſe is injoyned by my Superiors? If I may be inſtructed in the way of Salvation and eternal Happineſs, why ſhould I forſake the Publick Aſſemblies, becauſe I am not allowed to joyn my ſelf to what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation I pleaſe; and had not an immediate hand in the choice of my Paſtor? When our hearts are bent upon the <hi>great</hi> things of Religion, we ſhall ſee but little Reaſon to be Contentious about matters of leſſer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; a few indifferent Rites will ſcarce be able to tempt us to break off Communion with that Church, with which we are at perfect Agreement in all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Neceſſary points.</p>
                        <p>The next thing that may tend to the promoting our <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is the Conſideration of the heinous Nature and <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Schiſm;</hi> which is nothing elſe but the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> our ſelves from a True Church without any juſt Occaſion given. The want of due apprehenſions of the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> of this, ſeems to be the main Cauſe of our preſent Diviſions. Men are not generally ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible how much they do Oppoſe that Spirit of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:8"/> 
                           <hi>Peace,</hi> and brotherly Love, which ſhould diffuſe it ſelf through the whole Body of Chriſtian People, when they ſuppoſe every ſlender Pretence enough to juſtifie their departing from us, and ſetting up a Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Church. They think it a matter almoſt Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and that they are left to their own Choice to joyn with what Society of Chriſtians they pleaſe themſelves. Which giddy Principle, if it ſhould prevail, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw us into an abſolute Confuſion, and introduce all the Errors and Miſchiefs that can be imagined. But our bleſſed Lord founded but One Univerſal Church; and when he was ready to be Crucified for us, and <hi>Prayed not for the Apoſtles alone, but for them alſo that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">John 17. 20, 21.</note> 
                           <hi>ſhould believe in him through their word;</hi> one of the laſt Petitions which he then put up, amongſt divers others to the ſame purpoſe, was, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us, that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> This it is plain was to be a viſible <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> that might be taken notice of in the World, and ſo become an inducement to move men to the embracing of the Chriſtian Faith. Therefore as we would avoid the hardening of men in Atheiſm and Infidelity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Prayer of our dying Saviour, as much as in us lies, wholly ineffectual; we ſhould be exceeding Cautious that we do not wilfully <hi>Divide</hi> his holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. We are often warned of this; and how many Arguments does St. <hi>Paul</hi> heap together to perſwade us to keep the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                           <hi>of Peace? One Body, and one Spirit, even as you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in one hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all.</hi> And how patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally does the ſame Apoſtle exhort us again to the ſame thing, by all the mutual endearments that Chriſtianity affords; <hi>If there be therefore any Conſolation in Chriſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1, 2.</note>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:8"/> 
                           <hi>if any Comfort of Love, if any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies; fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind.</hi> Theſe vehement Exhortations to <hi>Peace</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, do ſtrictly oblige us to hold Communion with that Church which requires nothing that is Unlawful of us. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not admit us, unleſs we profeſs a belief of Tranſubſtantiation, and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and a certain kind of Infallibility, no body knows where; unleſs we will worſhip the Hoſt, and Saints, and Images, and do many other things directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God: We cannot therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with her, unleſs we ſhould partake of her groſs and ſuperſtitious Errours. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not exact any thing from us that God has forbidden; therefore we may Communicate with her without Sin; and if we may, it muſt be a Sin in us if we do not do it. Certain it is that every cauſleſs <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is a very great one; ſo great, that ſome of the Antients have thought it is not to be expiated by the Blood of Martyrdom; and I know no Cauſe ſufficient to defend our leaving a Communion, but a neceſſity of being involved in <hi>Sin,</hi> if we ſhould remain in it. Now ſince it muſt be confeſſed that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a very grievous <hi>Sin;</hi> we had need be well aſſured that we have juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it, before we withdraw from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Church; and if we have raſhly withdrawn, we are bound to return without delay.</p>
                        <p>Then we may conſider farther that all Chriſtians are <hi>obliged</hi> to endeavour, as much as they can, to <hi>avoid</hi> all <hi>differences</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> that may occaſion Quarrels and Conteſts among them. This will appear from that paſſionate Intreaty and Admonition which the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gave the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when they were in danger of being rent into ſeveral Factions, upon miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:9"/> and emulations not much unlike unto ours. <hi>Now</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>I beſeech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no Diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment.</hi> Such an Univerſal agreement and harmony in the Church is very deſirable, and every one is bound to promote it. And the firſt ſtep that can be made towards this happy <hi>Concord</hi> in <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> is to diſpoſe our minds to a calm and <hi>teachable</hi> Temper; to be always ready to acknowledg the force of an Argument, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict our former Perſwaſions never ſo much; to be grieved at the Animoſities, and uncharitable Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which a diverſity of Judgment is wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; <hi>to follow after the things which make for Peace;</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 19.</note> to be deſirous to ſee an end of theſe Unchriſtian Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and glad of every Opportunity that may bring us nearer to one another, and think we have gained a glorious Victory, when we have overcome any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake that kept us at a diſtance from our Brethren. This is a generous and truly Chriſtian diſpoſition, and that which has an immediate tendency towards the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all manner of Differences. On the other ſide, there can be little hopes that men ſhould ever agree, when they ſeem reſolved to maintain the point in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, whatever it is; when they do not ſtudy to be Satisfied, but to cheriſh their Scruples; and hunt about for New ones, when their old Objections are fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. This is a moſt perverſe and untractable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which takes away all poſſibility of a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. For while either of the Diſſenting Parties is thus unwilling to be Convinced, and ſearches after Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there will never be wanting ſome Cavil or other that muſt be ſure to ſerve them to perpetuate the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But 'tis a ſhrewd Sign we eſteem our Cauſe little
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:9"/> better than Deſperate, when, after the Weapons we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Fight with are wreſted from us, we ſnatch up any thing that comes next to hand to throw at our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. This Obſtinacy does not well become us: In all our Debates our aim ſhould be to find out the truth, and not to triumph over our Antagoniſt. All ſober Chriſtians, eſpecially where the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church is concerned, ſhould always ſtrive to bring the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to a happy iſſue, and compoſure; and not ſeek for Pretences to widen the breach. And then we might all join in Praiſing and Glorifying of God; and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again to that bleſſed eſtate they were in, at the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel, when <hi>the Multitude of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 4. 32. Ch. 2. 42.</note> 
                           <hi>them that believed were of one Heart, and of one Soul; and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi> Theſe few Conſiderations I have now mentioned might be ſomething uſeful to the procurement of ſuch a Holy and Heavenly <hi>Peace</hi> in all Chriſtian Societies throughout the World.</p>
                        <p>And if we were but careful never to be byaſſed by <hi>Paſſion</hi> or <hi>Intereſt;</hi> if our greateſt <hi>Zeal</hi> and Concern were placed upon the more <hi>Weighty</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; if we ſhould ſeriouſly conſider how grievous a <hi>Sin</hi> it is to <hi>Separate</hi> from a Church without any juſt cauſe; and if we were diſpoſed to <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to have our Doubts and Scruples ſatisfied; I think moſt of the <hi>Prejudices</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might be eaſily removed; and we might all joyn in the ſame Communion, to the Glory of God, and the Joy and Comfort of all good <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of thoſe that deſign to ſwallow us up, and have no other hopes of prevailing, but by the help of thoſe Differences, which for that end, they have a long time moſt ſtudiouſly fomented amongſt us. Let not our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:10"/> unreaſonable Fears and groundleſs Jealouſies encourage their Attempts with too great a probability of Succeſs. It would be a ſad addition to our Miſeries, if the Guilt and Shame of them too might be laid to our Charge. With what remorſe ſhould we reflect upon it, (when the heat of our Paſſion was over) if the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhould be farther endangered, and the Agents of <hi>Rome</hi> get greater Advantages dayly, by thoſe Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which have been ſecretly managed by them, but openly carried on and maintained by our ſelves! With what face ſhould we look to ſee our Enemies, not only triumphing over us, but mocking and deriding us, for being ſo far impoſed upon by their cunning, as to be made the immediate inſtruments of our own ruin! But God Almighty, in his wiſe and gracious Providence, ſo confound all their Devices that tend to the ſubverſion of the Truth; and ſo Unite and Compoſe our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, that hereafter we may have no juſt occaſion to fear either their Treachery, o their Force. This is a Petition, I am ſure, in which no good Chriſtian can refuſe to joyn; and if we do heartily deſire this, let us do what we can to promote it; if our Prayer be not unſincere and hypocritical, we ſhall make uſe of our beſt endeavours to obtain the thing we have prayed for. And now if our <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be thus deſirable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, what ſhould hinder but that at laſt we might be all moſt happily united under the Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> A Church that is already Framed and Conſtituted; that has the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Eſtabliſhment of the Laws; that has been Protected by a Succeſſion of Wiſe and Pious Princes; that was Defended unto Death by our late Martyred Sovereign; that was Reſtored by His Majeſty that now is, and has been ever ſince ſo graciouſly Cheriſhed by him, as if the Care of it were a Quality inherent and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:10"/> hereditary to the Crown. A Church that was Reformed by full and ſufficient Authority, upon mature and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deliberation; with a perfect ſubmiſſion to the Rule of holy Scripture, and a due regard to the example of the moſt Primitive times. A Church that has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly rejected all the Errours and Corruptions of <hi>Rome;</hi> that admits of neither their Infallibility, nor Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; that allows no Purgatory, nor Indulgences, no adoration of Reliques, and Images, no Praying to Saints nor Angels; that does not think that God can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with idle Pilgrimages, or a forced Celibacy, or any ſet number of <hi>Ave</hi>'s and <hi>Paternoſter</hi>'s, or other formal Devotions exactly computed upon a ſtring of Beads, and muttered over in an unknown Tongue; that does not rob the Laity of half the Communion, nor teach them that ſtrange and contradictious Doctrine that the Elements are tranſubſtantiated into the real Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Lord's Supper; that does not only conſtantly deny theſe, and many more abſurd and erroneous Opinions of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but has always ſent forth as ſtout and able Champions to oppoſe them, as any the Chriſtian World affords. A Church whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is confeſſed to be Orthodox by the generality of our Diſſenting Brethren, and whoſe Diſcipline and Order of external Worſhip has nothing in it repugnant to any Law of God. And what imaginable ground can there then be to juſtifie a <hi>Separation</hi> from ſuch a Church? Certainly the uſe of a few Indifferent things, appointed only for Order's ſake, will not be enough to do it. Theſe are not Forbidden, and therefore cannot be Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in themſelves; and where God has not Forbidden, our Superiours may Command; and in all ſuch caſes we are bound to Obey.</p>
                        <p>Some indeed there are that will not be ſatisfied with this. They tell us, that it is not ſufficient that a thing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:11"/> be not <hi>Forbidden,</hi> but that it muſt be <hi>Commanded,</hi> or elſe it cannot be uſed in the Worſhip of God without Sin. But if this Opinion be true, I muſt confeſs that then it is Unlawful to hold Communion not only with ours but with any Church that is, or ever was in the World; for I do not believe that One can be found amongſt them All, that has not required the uſe of ſome Indifferent thing that was not <hi>Commanded.</hi> Our Diſſenting Brethren themſelves will allow that the Time and Place of Religious Aſſemblies may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Authority. And if theſe neceſſary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be thus Determined, though they be not <hi>Commanded</hi> by God; then it will be as Lawful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what particular Geſtures and Habits ſhall be there uſed. For theſe are things of the ſame Nature; Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as neceſſary as Time and Place; and if we have any reſpect to the Decent and Reverent perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Service of God, they may be as neceſſary to be determined too. However it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that ſome things that are not Commanded may be Lawfully Enjoyned and Submitted to; and if ſome, then all that are of the ſame Indifferent nature; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there can be ſome ſufficient reaſon aſſigned why ſome ſhould be excepted, and ſome not; which will be very difficult where the Nature of the things is the ſame. And in our preſent caſe, it will be hard in the general to conceive how the Command of a Lawful Power ſhould make that Unlawful which was not <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> and by conſequence was Lawful before.</p>
                        <p>But if it ſhould be ſtill inſiſted on, that nothing muſt be <hi>Commanded</hi> that God has not <hi>Commanded;</hi> they that are of this Perſwaſion, ſhould be very certain that they have clear proof out of the Scriptures for it before they undertake to <hi>Forbid</hi> that which God has not <hi>Forbidden;</hi> or elſe they ſtand condemned by their own Principle.</p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:11"/>
                        <p>Now the Arguments they bring for this out of the New Teſtament are very few: And thoſe very obſcure, and no way applicable to the matter in hand, without being mightily ſtrained: Thoſe out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not many; that which has been chiefly urged, and ſeems indeed the moſt pertinent and material, is this: The whole <hi>Levitical</hi> Service was particularly preſcribed by God himſelf, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſtrictly charged to make the Tabernacle and all the Utenſils that belonged unto it, <hi>After the pattern that was ſhewed him</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 25. 40. Heb. 3. 5, 6.</note> 
                           <hi>in the Mount. And</hi> Moſes <hi>verily was faithful in all his Houſe as a Servant; and ſo is Chriſt as a Son over his own Houſe;</hi> that is, the Church: Therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> laid down all the particular Rules to be obſerved in the Worſhip of God, under the Legal Diſpenſation, ſo has Chriſt under the Evangelical; and it is as dangerous to add, as it is to detract from theſe written Rules; we may no more do what is not <hi>Commanded,</hi> then what is <hi>Forbidden.</hi> This I take to be the main Argument that is brought againſt us in the preſent Controverſie; and if this can be Anſwered, all the reſt will be but of little Force.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to give what ſatisfaction I can to this, I ſay firſt, that throughout the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Law and the Goſpel are compared, the ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew the exact Correſpondence there was betwixt the Type and the Antitype; and not that our Saviour had as particularly preſcribed the Order of external Worſhip, as <hi>Moſes</hi> by Gods appointment had done. For it is certain he did not; to give but one inſtance of very many: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> of Celebrating the Paſſover, how it ſhould be Killed, and how it ſhould be Eaten, is it ſet down with every minute Circumſtance: But the Inſtitution of the Supper of our Lord is not ſo delivered unto us: We
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:12"/> have only a ſhort Narrative, with a general Command ſuperadded; <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> And when <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> repeats it again, he does it without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Poſture of Receiving. The Goſpel which teaches us a more Spiritual way of Serving God, is not ſo particular in the Circumſtantials of Worſhip as the Law was; and we muſt not affirm that it is, becauſe we would have it ſo. We cannot prove that Chriſt has actually done this, becauſe we imagine that he ſhould have done it. It would be better argued if we ſhould ſay, The Goſpel has not expreſsly determined theſe things, as the Law did; therefore they are left to the prudent determination of <hi>thoſe that have the Rule over</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>us,</hi> to whom we are Commanded to be <hi>Obedient, and ſubmit our ſelves;</hi> that the Epiſcopal Power may be equivalent to the Sacerdotal; and the Service of God as regularly Adminiſtred in the Church, as it was in the Temple.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, it was not a Sin, even under the Law, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and obſerve ſome things, relating to the Worſhip of God, that were not written. And theſe could not be eſteemed additions to the Word, if they were not impoſed as Divine Precepts, but as Prudent Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, appointed only for the more Orderly manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the external Offices of Religion. But that any thing ſhould be Unlawful meerly becauſe it is not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> is a Doctrine, I think, that was never heard of among Jews or Chriſtians, till very lately. God had <hi>Commanded</hi> the ſetting up of a Tabernacle, and moſt punctually deſcribed how it ſhould be made: We have been told that there was not to be one <hi>Pin</hi> about it, for which there was not ſome ſpecial Direction. And God never <hi>ſpake a word concerning building of an Houſe;</hi>

Which is proof enough that every thing then that was not <hi>Commanded,</hi> was not therefore Sinful. The antient Church of the Jews were ſo fully ſatisfied in this, that they made no Scruple of ordering divers things, for which they could not find a <hi>Command.</hi> The Feaſt of the Dedication is a known and pregnant inſtance; it was of modern and humane Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and yet our Saviour vouchſafed to be preſent at <note place="margin">John 10. 22.</note> it. Some things they a little altered, and added others, at the Paſſeover; as their eating of it not Standing, but Sitting, or Lying at the Table; and their Singing a Paſchal Hymn after it; which with ſome other like Uſages, were obſerved by our bleſſed Lord, and his Diſciples; and it can be no leſs than Blaſphemy then to conceive, that there could be any thing that was Sinful in them. The whole matter may be concluded thus: If it were not Sinful under the Law, where the external Form of Divine Worſhip was particularly ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, to admit of certain Uſages that were not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> then much leſs is it Sinful to do ſo now under the Goſpel, where the external Form is not ſo ſpecified; where we have little more than ſuch general Rules as theſe, to be reſpectively applied by Superiors and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors: <hi>Let all things be done Decently, and in Order:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40. Heb. 13. 17. Rom. 4. 15.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>I have been ſomething the longer in conſidering this Argument, becauſe the whole debate muſt iſſue here; which way ſoever this be decided, the Controverſie is at an end. If our Church require any thing of us that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:13"/> is Unlawful, we are bound to <hi>Separate</hi> from her; if ſhe do not, we are ſtrictly ingaged to Communicate with her. They therefore that Divide, ſhould firſt ſhew that ſhe injoyns ſomething Unlawful. But that never was, and I verily believe never can be made appear. For we are told, in the Perſon of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>All things are Lawful;</hi> which muſt of neceſſity be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12. 10. 23.</note> of things that are not <hi>Forbidden:</hi> And then ſince it cannot be charged upon our Church, that ſhe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands any thing that is <hi>Forbidden;</hi> it muſt be granted that ſhe Commands nothing, but what the Apoſtle has declared to be <hi>Lawful.</hi> What Reaſon then can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, why we ſhould rend and tear her very Bowels? Why ſhould we run ſo headily into oppoſite Parties and Factions? Why ſhould we hazard the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe upon a number of little diſunited Independent Intereſts, that are as much at Difference one with another, as they all are with us? What ſhould make us ſo timorous in this, when we are ſo daring in ſome other caſes? Why ſhould we be afraid to joyn in Communion with a Reformed Church, whoſe Doctrine is Orthodox, whoſe Rites ae Innocent, whoſe Government is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical? A man would wonder truly what could be pleaded in defence of a Separation, when none of theſe can be juſtly accuſed. And yet there are certain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections brought againſt us, which thoſe that withdraw would fain perſwade us to think ſufficient to juſtifie their Departure. To ſome of the chief of theſe I ſhall now endeavour to give what ſatisfaction I can.</p>
                        <p>Our Diſſenting Brethren therefore are wont to plead; That there is a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or Set <hi>Form</hi> of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſcribed; That there are certain <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; That the uſe of theſe Controverted things gives great <hi>Scandal</hi> to the weak; That they cannot Safely joyn in our <hi>mixt Communion;</hi> That they leave our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:13"/> for the ſake of <hi>greater Edification,</hi> which they can find elſewhere: And for theſe Reaſons they think they are neceſſitated to depart from ours, and ſet up Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to themſelves, according to the beſt Models that every one is able to draw. This is certainly a very dangerous adventure; and can never be juſtified by ſuch Arguments, as are produced; which might be all eaſily anſwered upon the general Principle I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; That none of the things againſt which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are made are Unlawful; and therefore they cannot make our Communion Unlawful; and if that be not Unlawful, it muſt be Unlawful to divide from it. This might be Reply enough to the moſt, if not all the Objections that are, or can be brought. But becauſe it may be thought more ſatisfactory by ſome, I ſhall give a particular, though very ſhort Anſwer to thoſe I have now propoſed.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt and Great thing that is objected againſt our Church, is preſcribing a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or Set <hi>Form</hi> of Prayers to be conſtantly uſed in Publick Worſhip. This is that which has raiſed a great many Clamours; Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds have been extreamly incenſed and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt it; it has been cryed out upon as <hi>Idolatrous, Popiſh, Superſtitious,</hi> and I know not how many hard Names it has been called. But I am glad to find the temper of our Diſſenting Brethren altered ſo much for the better: We do not now ſo often hear thoſe bitter exclamations of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Babylon, Baal</hi> and <hi>Dagon:</hi> The <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is not eſteemed ſuch an abominable thing, as ſome ignorant and heady Zealots were wont to count it. Among thoſe that have but too openly favoured the <hi>Separation</hi> the more conſiderable part, both for Number and Sobriety, do not only allow that a <hi>Form</hi> is Lawful, but will freely acknowledge that ours is ſo; and therefore they will admit of Occaſional; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:14"/> if ſo, I cannot ſee what can withhold them from a full and conſtant Communion with us. Certainly that which is Lawful once or twice, muſt be Lawful always. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may take ſome delight to ſee the old Heats in any meaſure abated, and that the leaſt advances are made towards Peace. God grant that this Conceſſion may prove a ſtep to a happy and perfect Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo I hope it may; for our Brethren can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any longer offended with thoſe Forms in which they do ſometimes join themſelves. Nay thoſe that have not yet proceeded ſo far, but are ſtill afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Defiled in our way of Worſhip, cannot have any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to Condemn it for being a <hi>Form.</hi> The Jews had <hi>Forms</hi> in their Publick Aſſemblies, which this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were duly frequented by our bleſſed Saviour: He delivered a <hi>Form</hi> himſelf, in his Sermon on the <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 9, &amp;c.</note> Mount, and taught the ſame again to his Diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <note place="margin">Luke 11. 2.</note> and Commanded them to uſe it: Some <hi>Forms</hi> were received very early among the Ancient Chriſtians; who have been followed in this by all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches; but the Lawfulneſs of them was never called in queſtion heretofore: For how could it, ſince they are no were Forbidden? Or if a Command be thought requiſite to make them Lawful, the other way is no more Commanded than this; and therefore upon that Principle they muſt be both equally Lawful, or Unlawful: So that if any Prayer be Lawful, a <hi>Form</hi> muſt be confeſſed to be ſo. The Arguments in this caſe are ſo Convincing, that there are few now but that will readily agree that a <hi>Form</hi> may be Lawful in it ſelf; but then they think it ought not to be Impoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome Inconveniences which they conceive do attend it. And they are principally theſe Two; the One, that there may be ſome particular Emergencies which cannot be provided for by a Set <hi>Form.</hi> The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:14"/> other, that it is an hinderance to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer. The firſt of theſe has very little difficulty in it. The ordinary wants and neceſſities of Chriſtians are always the ſame, and we may Petition to have them ſupplied in the ſame Words; and for other things, it may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be foreſeen that they may happen ſometimes; and ſutable <hi>Forms</hi> may be compoſed to be uſed upon ſuch Occaſions: Where theſe cannot be fitly applied, peculiar Offices may be ſet forth; as has been uſual in ſuch caſes: Where the exigency is great, and will not admit of ſo much delay as is neceſſary for that, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is at Liberty to uſe his own Conceptions. But this cannot be urged for the Excluſion of a <hi>Liturgy.</hi> It were very unreaſonable to deprive the Church of known and approved <hi>Forms,</hi> and leave her to the mercy of extemporary Effuſions only; for the ſake of a few Contingencies, which may happen but very rarely, if at all, in a whole Age.</p>
                        <p>The other thing that is alledged would be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, if it were really true, That <hi>Forms</hi> did indeed <hi>hinder</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer. But this they do not: For it is a groſs and carnal Miſtake to imagine that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer can conſiſt in a readineſs of Expreſſion, and a natural or acquired volubility of Tongue; Arts and Accompliſhments whereof many Wicked men have been great Maſters; and wherein as many Good ones may be very deficient. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer muſt be acknowledged to be nothing elſe but an inward good and pious Diſpoſition of the Soul, wrought in us by the Grace of God; an unfeigned Humility and Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our ſelves, when we confeſs our Sins, and beg for Pardon; an affectionate Senſe of our Wants, when we ask for all things neceſſary, both for this and the other Life; an holy exultation of Mind, when we offer up our Praiſes and Thanks for the Bleſſings we have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:15"/> received; a full Reſignation of our Concerns to God's diſpoſal, and a Dependance upon his Promiſes for the granting our Requeſts, when we have made our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes unto him. Theſe are the great Indications of the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer; and theſe are ſo far from being <hi>Hindered,</hi> that they may be very much Helped, and Advantaged by a <hi>Form.</hi> A man queſtionleſs may be more ſeriouſly Affected, in all theſe reſpects, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> more heartily to a <hi>Form</hi> of ſound Words which he hath known, and conſidered before, than he can to ſome uncertain Expreſſions which he never heard, nor thought on; and poſſibly may not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor be ſatisfied in, when he hears them. The perplexity and doubtfulneſs of Thoughts, which muſt often ariſe, when we would join in Prayers we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with, is directly Oppoſite to that Faith and Aſſurance with which we ſhould Pray; and can ſcarce be prevented but by a well digeſted and ſtudied <hi>Form;</hi> that may be Weighed, and ſoberly Aſſented to, by thoſe that are required to join in it.</p>
                        <p>But ſome think that it may be manifeſt from <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> that <hi>Forms</hi> are a <hi>hinderance</hi> to the very inward <hi>Spirit</hi> of Devotion. They have found their Affections very cold and flat, at our uſual ſtated <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer; but when they hear a man Pray without a <hi>Form,</hi> they are mightily raviſhed, and almoſt tranſported; and this difference of Temper they obſerve in themſelves has prevailed with many, of the more undiſcerning ſort eſpecially, to forſake our Communion. But it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very dangerous to judge of things not by our Underſtandings, but by the various impulſes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Affections. When we have Scripture and Reaſon on our ſide, we cannot be Deceived; but when we Determine, as we are ſwayed by the preſent byaſs of our Paſſions; theſe may be Charmed, or Raiſed, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:15"/> Flattened, by ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Spirits;</hi> and quickly betray us into ſtrong Deluſions. Therefore if any one ſhould be tempted, as ſome have been, to leave the Church on this Account, that he thinks he may be more <hi>affected</hi> in another Place; before he goes, I would deſire him to conſider what it is that does thus <hi>Affect</hi> him: If it be the Matter and Subſtance of the Prayer, I ſuppoſe that may be uſually the ſame, at leaſt as good in our ordinary Offices, as it is in their unpremeditated Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ſo it will not be neceſſary to make a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for this: If it be only the chiming and harmony of the Words he is taken with, this is no more but a kind of ſenſitive Delight; and to apply the Prophet's Expreſſions here, it is but like <hi>a very lovely Song of one</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 32.</note> 
                           <hi>that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well on an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> This will by no means excuſe our departing from the Publick Aſſemblies; this would be in effect to ſay, that we may make Diviſions in the Church of God, to gratifie our own private, and it may be miſtaken Fancies. But if any one hath left us for a time upon this Pretence, and made ſome Trial of both ways, then I would deſire him ſtrictly to examine his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whether he have not often been as Dull and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different at a Conceived Prayer, as ever he was at the Service of the Church: And then on the other ſide, let him conſider, whether he do not believe that very many may be as ſerious and devout at the Common Prayer, as ever he was at any in the other way he is pleaſed to prefer: And after he has thus inquired, if he ſee Reaſon to acknowledge both, as doubtleſs he will, then the Scales will be even at the leaſt: <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> will ſhew, that men may be Fervent and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate with a <hi>Form,</hi> and Cold and Inattentive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one. And therefore when we are heavy, liſtleſs, and unaffected at a Prayer by a <hi>Form;</hi> this Defect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:16"/> proceed from the Manner of the Devotion, but from the Indiſpoſition of the Perſon that uſes it. And when we <hi>Separate</hi> upon this occaſion, we are guilty of a double Iniquity, in Dividing the Church without ſufficient Cauſe; and charging our own Formality upon a good and wholeſome Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>My intended brevity will not permit me to give a particular Anſwer to all the Exceptions that have been taken at our <hi>Liturgy;</hi> only in the general I ſay, I know nothing in it that can be pretended to be Sinful in it ſelf. The moſt that is urged are ſome ſuppoſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; which if we ſhould grant to be real, they cannot make our Communion Unlawful; and then, as I have often intimated, it muſt be a Sin to <hi>Separate</hi> from it; and we may not commit a Sin to decline an Inconvenience: This would be to <hi>do evil that good may come</hi> of it. They that are willing to improve every ſlight Exception into a Cauſe of <hi>Separation,</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this. The queſtion is not, whether there be not any thing in the Order of our Divine Service which a man could wiſh to be altered? For that can never be expected under any Conſtitution. The main inquiry is this, whether any thing Unlawful be appointed to be uſed, which will make an Alteration not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, but neceſſary? And whether we are bound to withdraw till ſuch Alteration be made? Which has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been proved: Men generally forbear our Publick Worſhip, without ever examining into it, upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground but becauſe they prefer their own Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way before it. Which I do not admire; but this is very ſtrange and unreaſonable, that they ſhould take ſuch a diſguſt at our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and fly away from it, as if it were <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> when they never have ſo much as read it; at leaſt conſidered it, as they ought. And here I ſhall take the Confidence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:16"/> to affirm that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſome abhor ſo much, was made and reviewed with that Prudence and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Care and Circumſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tion, that there is not any thing now extant in that kind, that has been compos'd with greater Wiſdom, and Piety. If we ſhould take the liberty to compare it with the performances in the other way; (not to mention the many undecent, incoherent, irreverent expreſſions, to ſay no worſe, that might be collected) let any Prayer made occaſionally and <hi>extempore</hi> by the ableſt and moſt cautious of thoſe that magnifie that way, and deſpiſe ours, be taken exactly in writing, and publiſhed to the World; and I am very confident, that one man, without any great pains, may find more things really exceptionable, in that ſingle Prayer, in a ſhort time, than the ſeveral Parties of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, with all the diligence they have hitherto uſed, have been able to diſcover in the whole Service of our Church in more than a hundred years. And yet ſome of our Brethren, that ſeek induſtriouſly for Scruples in the Common Prayer, will readily join in other ſudden conceived Prayers, without any Scruple; when they cannot tell but that there may be ſome dangerous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in every Sentence, and ſome great Indecencies and Abſurdities in every Word. This is ſuch partiality, and unequal dealing, as cannot be eaſily excus'd.</p>
                        <p>But if they ſhould allow of the <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer in our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> there are certain <hi>Ceremonies</hi> injoyn'd, which they think give them occaſion enough to depart from our Communion. A man that were unacquainted with the true State of our caſe, that ſhould ſtand by and only hear the bitter Cries and Invectives that have been made againſt <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> would be ready to imagine that ſure our Church was nothing elſe almoſt but <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> But he would be mightily ſurprized, when upon inquiry he ſhould find, that theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:17"/> had occaſioned all this noiſe, ſhould be no more than Three; the <hi>Surplice,</hi> the <hi>Croſs</hi> after Baptiſm, and <hi>Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> at the Sacrament. He would be amazed to think that theſe ſhould be the things, about which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maſſy Books had been written! So great diſcords and animoſities rais'd! Such a flouriſhing Church once quite deſtroyed, and now moſt miſerably divided, after it had been ſo happily reſtored! And his wonder muſt be increaſed, when he ſhould perceive that of theſe Three, there was but One, and no more, in which the People were any way concerned. The <hi>Croſs</hi> and the <hi>Surplice,</hi> are to be uſed only by the Miniſter; and if his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be ſatisfied, no mans elſe need to be diſturb'd about them. To <hi>Kneel</hi> at the Lord's Supper all indeed are commanded; but ſuppoſing this to be Unlawful, it could hinder us only from partaking in that Ordinance, and not in the reſt. But of that farther by and by.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, I do not underſtand but that ſome <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and particular Determinations of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are abſolutely neceſſary in the Worſhip of God; ſince it cannot be performed without them; they that will have no <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> can have no external Worſhip. This I think will not be denied. But the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that are appointed in our Church are thought by ſome to be <hi>ſignificant, ſuperſtitious,</hi> and breaches of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Liberty;</hi> and therefore not to be indured. Theſe are the great Objections againſt the few <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that are in uſe among us; and theſe I ſhall briefly Conſider.</p>
                        <p>Firſt we are told our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are <hi>ſignificant:</hi> And why may not a <hi>ſignificant Ceremony</hi> be Lawful? Are not Kneeling, and lifting up the Eyes and Hands to Heaven <hi>ſignifications</hi> of the Reverence we owe to the Divine Majeſty? Yes: But <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that <hi>ſignify</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing naturally, may be permitted; but not thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:17"/> that <hi>ſignify</hi> by inſtitution. There ſhould be ſome ſolid reaſon, or ſome plain Scripture Authority brought, to make this difference good: And here it is pleaded that every <hi>ſignificant Ceremony</hi> is a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and it is downright <hi>Popery</hi> to make more <hi>Sacraments,</hi> than God has made. This I confeſs were very material, if it could be proved. But we acknowledge nothing to be a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but what is <hi>An outward and viſible ſign of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Common Prayer in the Catech.</note> 
                           <hi>an inward and ſpiritual grace, given unto us, ordained by Chriſt himſelf, as a means whereby we receive the ſame, and a pledge to aſſure us thereof.</hi> Now if this be a true Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as it is owned by us, and muſt be acknowledged by our Diſſenting Brethren that talk ſo much of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Doctrine of our Church; then our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> though they ſhould be never ſo <hi>ſignificant,</hi> cannot be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> becauſe they want ſo many Neceſſary and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conditions that are required to make a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> They are not of Divine <hi>Ordination</hi> and Appointment, they are of no efficacy to confer any <hi>Grace,</hi> neither are they any <hi>Pledges,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurances</hi> of it. But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant every <hi>ſignificant Ceremony</hi> to be a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for it is neither pleaſant nor profitable to quarrel about Words: There is but one of the Three <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and that is the <hi>Croſs</hi> at Baptiſm, that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ibid.</hi> in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Baptiſm.</note> to be <hi>ſignificant;</hi> and that indeed is made, <hi>In token that</hi> the party newly Baptized <hi>ſhall not hereafter be aſhamed to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt Crucified,</hi> &amp;c. But this <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> was very anciently, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, uſed at Baptiſm, and upon ſeveral other occaſions, by the Primitive Chriſtians, in defiance of all ſorts of Infidels, and as we do it, <hi>in Token</hi> that they were <hi>not aſhamed</hi> of a <hi>Crucified</hi> Saviour. Our Church in this does but follow the example of the Pureſt and Holieſt Profeſſors of the Goſpel that ever were; and that but at a diſtance too, in doing that but once, which they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:18"/> repeated often. And this can ſcarce be called a <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremony.</hi> It is not appointed to Repreſent any thing unto us, but only to remind us of a Duty we are bound to do. Like the <hi>Altar</hi> that was built by the Children of <hi>Reuben,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh, Not for burnt-offering, nor for ſacrifice; but</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Joſh. 22. 26.</note> 
                           <hi>that it might be a Witneſs.</hi> And if any one ſhould think the <hi>Surplice</hi> were ordered to be worn to denote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of Life, that does more eſpecially become thoſe that are particularly devoted to the Service of God; it is more than our Church has declared; but yet no man were to be blamed, that ſhould take occaſion from hence, to let his thoughts expatiate into a pious and ſeaſonable Meditation, and conſider how incongruous it would be, to have his inward parts full of filthineſs and corruption, when his outſide was covered with a clean white Linnen Garment. The Sum is, every <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremony</hi> is not a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and none of ours can be properly ſaid to be <hi>ſignificant,</hi> repreſenting, <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical;</hi> but only <hi>Commemorating,</hi> or if any man pleaſe to call them ſo, <hi>Profeſſing ſigns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But though they cannot be proved to be <hi>Sacraments,</hi> yet they may be <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and that is Objection enough againſt them. And I confeſs that they may be <hi>Superſtitious;</hi> but not in themſelves, for ſo they are perfectly Indifferent; but according to the Opinion or Conceit of thoſe that uſe them, or uſe them not. There may be <hi>Superſtition</hi> in the Obſerving of theſe, and there may be as much in the forbearing. <hi>Superſtition</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a groundleſs Fancy attended ſometimes with an anxious Fear, and ſometimes with a fond Hope, that God is pleaſed or diſpleaſed with the bare performance or forbearance of what he hath neither Commanded nor Forbidden. He therefore that thinks he offends God in doing of that he has not Forbidden; and he that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:18"/> imagines he ſhall pleaſe him, by the obſerving of what he has not Commanded, are both in ſome degree, and it may be, equally <hi>Superſtitious.</hi> And then the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> that is exerciſed about the Obſervation of theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> muſt lie on the part of our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who think they ſhould Sin in keeping them, though they generally confeſs they are not Forbidden; and not on ours, who declare them to be Indifferent, and no otherwiſe acceptable unto God, but as they are the effects of Obedience to our Superiours, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the preſervation of Diſcipline and Order in the Church.</p>
                        <p>But it is farther urged by ſome, that theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are a <hi>Breach</hi> of our Chriſtian <hi>Liberty.</hi> I need not enter upon a Diſcourſe of this; but as far as it concerns the matter in hand, I ſay; That the being freed from the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law is a part, though not the greateſt part of Chriſtian <hi>Liberty;</hi> but then it is not ſo much our being freed from obſerving it, as from the Neceſſity of obſerving it. The Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily obſerve it for ſome time upon Prudential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; and impoſed ſome things, as the <hi>abſtaining</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 15. 29.</note> 
                           <hi>from bloud, and from things ſtrangled;</hi> and yet they were <hi>Free,</hi> becauſe whatever they did of this Nature, they did it not with an Opinion of any Neceſſary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that lay upon them to do it, but upon other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; moſt commonly out of condeſcenſion to the weakneſs of the Jewiſh Converts. And if ſome <hi>Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Rites might not only be obſerved, but impoſed then; there can be no reaſon why a few Indifferent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> may not be appointed now, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment upon the <hi>Liberty</hi> which Chriſt has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us. Such things cannot be an infringment of that, but only when they are ſuppoſed to be either Unlawful or Neceſſary by Divine Command.</p>

But ſure if the particular Geſture had been ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as ſome do imagine, there would have been ſome plain, and expreſs mention of it ſomewhere in the Scripture; which there is not, as I have noted before. And then it muſt be very unwarrantable in thoſe, that <hi>Separate</hi> from our Church, becauſe they will not receive in that reverent manner which She has preſcribed. If there had been nothing injoyned in this matter, a man upon a ſerious apprehenſion of the infinite mercies of God, through the merits and mediation of his bleſſed Saviour, could ſcarce have forborn falling upon his Knees, when he came to partake of the Sacrament of his moſt precious Body and Blood. The commemoration of the Death and Paſſion of the Son of God, by which he was Redeemed would ſtrike him almoſt naturally, into the humbleſt poſture of Adoration. But if any reverence be granted to be due at ſuch a time, I am ſure <hi>ſitting</hi> at the Table, is a very unfit poſture to expreſs it. Or if any man ſhould like it better than that which is required with us; yet to make this an occaſion of departing from our Communion, would argue but too little value for the peace of the Church.</p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:19"/>
                        <p>But ſome there are who though they be convinced of the Lawfulneſs of all theſe Rites and Uſages, and for their own particular, could joyn with us well enough; yet they dare not do it, for fear of giving <hi>Scandal</hi> and Offence to thoſe that are not ſatisfied in theſe things. This matter of <hi>Scandal</hi> has been ſo vehemently pleaded ſometimes as if it were the only thing to be regarded in all Church Conſtitutions; and that they were to be immediately diſuſed, whatever Authority injoyned them, aſſoon as any ſhould be offended at them. This puts all external Order in Chriſtian Aſſemblies into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tottering condition, ready to be preſently overturned, by every little Scruple, that may chance to ariſe. But for anſwer to this we muſt obſerve: That they are the Weak, and Ignorant that take Offence: That their doubts and ſcruples are not to be nouriſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <note place="margin">See Rom. 14.</note> but only born with for a time; That they are bound to take all due Care, and convenient Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> of Inſtruction, that they may be fully ſatisfied; and that it is in things meerly Indifferent, ſuch as <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> where we are obliged to any compliance, for the avoiding of <hi>Scandal.</hi> Theſe things thus briefly premiſed, let it be conſidered; whether they who eſteem themſelves rather more Knowing than others, who ſeem unwilling to part with their Doubts, and who have entertained ſome Prejudices againſt thoſe that would inform them better, are to be treated like weak Brethren? And whether we ought to yield to them, where Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority has determined the contrary; unleſs we could prove our Obedience as Indifferent as the things ſcrupled at are ſuppoſed to be? If it ſhould be ſaid that we ought; yet at leaſt it cannot be ſafely done, till it be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that all the weak are of one ſide. For in our preſent Caſe, if there ſhould be as many, as doubtleſs there are, that would be offended to ſee the manner of our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:20"/> Worſhip altered, as there are to ſee it impoſed; then though the command of our Superiors ſhould ſignify nothing, we ſhould yet be upon equal terms, on the account of <hi>Scandal</hi> only; and as much bound not to <hi>Separate,</hi> as they think they are to <hi>Separate,</hi> by their own Principle. But in a word, no <hi>Scandal</hi> taken at an Indifferent thing, can be ſo great as the Sin, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal both, of Confuſion and Diſorder, and Contempt of Authority.</p>
                        <p>There is another Exception near akin to this: Some have thought they muſt withdraw from us, becauſe of our <hi>mixt Communions,</hi> and that ſome which they judg unworthy Receivers, are admitted to the Lord's Table. This Objection proves nothing but a Supercilious Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and a great want of Charity in thoſe that make it. What care they may take in their new way of Diſcipline, I cannot tell; but our Church has given the Miniſter a Power of rejecting thoſe that are guilty <note place="margin">See Rubr. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> of any known and ſcandalous Sin. And this is as much as can be done; the open Sinner may be excluded, but the cloſe Hypocrite will eſcape the narroweſt ſearch, that humane Induſtry can make. But if any <hi>notorious evil Livers</hi> ſhould be admitted through the ignorance, inadvertency, or negligence of the Miniſter; their Unworthineſs cannot defile thoſe that Communicate with them. It is generally thought that the Curſed Traytor <hi>Judas</hi> did partake of the Holy Supper, when it was firſt inſtituted by our Lord. God be praiſed, I have not heard, that amongſt us, the abuſes of this Ordinance, did ever ariſe to that Degree that they were at among the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> when at the very time of receiving, <hi>one was Hungry, and another Drunken:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 21.</note> and yet the Apoſtle does not Command them to forſake the <hi>Communion</hi> of that Church, where theſe Scandalous Enormities were committed. Every man is charged
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:20"/> to <hi>Examine himſelf,</hi> and not another, before he preſume <note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> 
                           <hi>to eat of that Bread and, drink of that Cup.</hi> And it would be very well, if all men would hearken to this holy and pious Admonition; for he that inquires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly into his own Sins, will find great cauſe to be Humble and Penitent, and ſo may become a worthy Communicant: But he that is curious to pry into the miſcarriages of other men, will be apt to be vain, proud, ſelf-conceited, and cenſorious; which will make him as unfit for the Table of the Lord, as any of thoſe Faults which he ſo ſcornfully condemns in his Neighbour, that he eſteems himſelf, and the ordinances of God pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by his Company.</p>
                        <p>But if none of theſe Pleas, I have mentioned, ſhould be ſufficient; many think they may leave our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies only for the ſake of <hi>greater Edification,</hi> which they can find elſewhere. This I believe prevails with great numbers, of the more ignorant eſpecially, to depart from us. And I would to God they might obtain what they ſay they depart for; and that they were indeed more <hi>Edified,</hi> and did grow in Grace, under what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery ſoever it be. But alas! This talk of <hi>greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification</hi> is many times meer wantonneſs, and inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of humour; and too often rather in Fancy than effect. Men conceit that they are better <hi>Edified,</hi> not when they are more fully inſtructed in any weighty point of Faith; or more perfectly informed in ſome neceſſary Duty; or more efficaciouſly moved to the practice of what they Know; but when they are <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And they that are troubled with this diſeaſe, inſtead of being <hi>Edified,</hi> as they pretend, are commonly the moſt ignorant of all; and as blamable as any in their ordinary Converſation.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:21"/> I wiſh we had not too many examples of the truth of this. For beſides that, it is great odds but that they make an unwiſe choice in the Teacher they ſet up to themſelves at laſt; they likewiſe provoke God to leave them to the vanity of their own Minds, when they depend rather on the ſuppoſed abilities of a man, than the bleſſed influences of the holy Spirit; and look more at <hi>Paul that plants,</hi> and <hi>Apollos that waters,</hi> then at <hi>God that gives the increaſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we have all things neceſſary to the building us up in our moſt holy Faith, in the Communion of the Church; it will be but a poor excuſe for our Dividing from it, that we hoped to be better <hi>Edified;</hi> when we had no incouragement at all to hope it, as long as we continued in the ſtate of <hi>Separation,</hi> upon this pretence For it is the bleſſing of God alone, and not any mans skill in diſpenſing them, that can make the Word and Ordinances any way beneficial unto us. With the help of his Grace, thoſe means of inſtruction which we ſometimes undervalue the moſt, may be profitable to our Salvation: Without it our Ears may be tickled, and our Fancies pleaſantly entertained for the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we cannot be truly <hi>Edified</hi> by the moſt fluent and popular Tongue, nor the moſt melting and pathetical Expreſſions in the World.</p>
                        <p>I have briefly examined the chief Objections that are brought againſt the eſtabliſhed Order, and Conſtitution of our Church; and do not find that any, or all of them together, are of force enough to move an unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Perſon to forſake her Communion. It may not be done upon the account of <hi>Liturgy, Ceremonies, Scandal, mixt Communion,</hi> or out of hopes of <hi>greater Edification.</hi> I might have eaſily inlarged upon all theſe particulars; but the compaſs of my preſent Deſign would not allow it. And I have ſome hopes that theſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:21"/> and other points in difference, may be handled by others to better advantage, and to the ſatisfaction of thoſe that are not yet convinced, and to the happy ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a laſting <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> among all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this divided Church. God grant that all our indeavours may tend this way; and that the Divine Goodneſs may make them Succeſsful. If theſe Papers ſhould chance to fall into the hands of any one of thoſe that have <hi>Separated</hi> from us, I would intreat him not to be Offended at them; but to look upon the Author, as a well-meaning Man, that was willing to throw a little Water upon the common flame, that is like to conſume us. They were not written, I am ſure with any bitterneſs of Mind, or Expreſſion; but out of meer pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſee a poor, lamentable, diſtreſſed Church, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing away, and ready to periſh by deſperate Wounds and Convulſions within her own Bowels. Such ſad and Melancholy thoughts as theſe apprehenſions muſt needs occaſion, could ſcarce be vented in angry and provoking Language. But ſome are ſo tender of the Opinions they have taken up, that whether true or falſe, they cannot endure to have them touched: They are impatient of the calmeſt Oppoſition; and when you offer any thing to perſwade them, though it ſhould be to brotherly Love and Peace among Chriſtians, they ſuſpect you for an Enemy, and think that you come to ſet traps in their way to inſnare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. But I hope this ſhort Diſcourſe will not be incountered by any ſuch Prejudice; but that it may be peruſed, with the ſame Impartiality that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                        <p>On this preſumption, I ſhall be bold to exhort all thoſe that now Diſſent, to a Brotherly <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> upon ſuch motives and arguments, as the Goſpel ſuggeſts, and make for the Credit and Safety of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:22"/> Religion. It will be readily acknowledged by every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and intelligent man, that Peace and Amity, and a good Correſpondence betwixt the ſeveral Members of which they conſiſt, is the only Beauty, Strength, and Security of all Societies; and on the contrary, that the nouriſhing of Animoſities, and running into oppoſite Parties and Factions, does mightily weaken, and by degrees almoſt unavoidably draw on the Ruin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of any Community, whether Civil or Sacred. Concord and Union therefore will be as neceſſary for the Preſervation of the Church, as of the State. It has been known by too ſad an Experience, as well in ours as other Ages, what a pernicious Influence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Broils and Quarrels among Chriſtians have had. They have been the great ſtumbling Block to Jews, Turks, and Heathens; and the main hinderance of their Converſion; they have made ſome among our ſelves to become Doubtful and Sceptical in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they have led others into many dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that ſhake the very Foundations of our Faith; and ſome they have tempted to caſt off the Natural ſenſe they had of the Deity, and imboldened to an open and profeſſed Atheiſm.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are ſome of the moſt uſual Fruits, which the unhappy Differences in the Church are wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; over and above the particular Unkindneſſes and Uncharitable Feuds, which they commonly beget a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians of the ſame Perſwaſion, as to all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and weighty matters of Belief. And it were a thing very deſirable in all reſpects, that theſe at leaſt ſhould be all firmly United in the ſame holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They that have the ſame Articles of Faith, and hope to meet in the ſame Heaven, through the Merits of the ſame Lord, ſhould not be afraid to come into the ſame Aſſemblies, and join ſeriouſly in ſending up the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:22"/> ſame Prayers, and participating of the ſame Sacraments. Beſides the many ſtrict Precepts and other ſtrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which we have unto this; our Saviour <hi>Died</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 52.</note> 
                           <hi>that he might gather together in One, the Children of God that were ſcattered abroad.</hi> And ſhould we not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this end of his Death, if we ſhould ſet thoſe at Strife and Variance which he intended to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite?</hi> Nay, might we not be ſaid, in ſome ſort, to <hi>Crucifie the Son of God afreſh;</hi> if we ſhould Mangle and Divide any ſound and healthful part of that Body of which he owns himſelf to be the Head? If indeed our Church did require us to make profeſſion of any falſe and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Opinions; if in the external Order and Worſhip we were injoined to do any thing contrary to any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command; we are bound in ſuch Inſtances to withdraw from her: But if her Doctrine be highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by moſt of our Diſſenting Brethren; and her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Service ſuch, as is not any way inconſiſtent with any Law of God; then we are indiſpenſably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to join in Communion with her. For, as has been intimated ſeveral times, and it cannot be inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too often, Nothing but the Unlawfulneſs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating can make a <hi>Separation</hi> Lawful.</p>
                        <p>But if it be reſolved that the Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt be forſaken, notwithſtanding that neither her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine nor Diſcipline can be juſtly condemned; it would yet convenient to bethink our ſelves, what might be the moſt adviſable to be done after we had left it. Whether we ſhould ſet up another way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration in the room of it: Or whether every one ſhould have the Liberty of following that which he fancied the beſt. If we are for the ſetting up another way; it muſt be either <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Independency:</hi> For if there ſhould be any other new Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are not yet of Reputation enough to be put
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:23"/> in Competition with theſe two great Pretenders to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right. And <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which had once the faireſt hopes of eſtabliſhing it ſelf, is now grown weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in compariſon of what it was; and thoſe few which would ſtill be thought of that Perſwaſion, are manifeſtly departed from their own Principles, and are fain to ſupport themſelves by Gathered Aſſemblies, which they were not wont to allow. <hi>Independency</hi> therefore ſeems at this time to be the prevailing way; but their manner of Gathering Members, and Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into particular Congregations, their <hi>holy Band, ſpecial Agreement,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> which they make eſſential to the Conſtituting of a Church, are things which have not the leaſt foundation in the holy Scriptures; neither were they ever Countenanced by the practice of any Orthodox Chriſtians in former Ages. But put the caſe we ſhould admit of either of theſe Forms of Diſcipline and Government, we ſhould be as far, if not farther from being <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> than we are now. For they have both been known to have been very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Impoſers, wherever they have had the Power of Commanding; and as they have ſometimes been, ſo they would ſoon again become more odious to the ſeveral Subdiviſions of Diſſenters than <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> it ſelf. And this being a thing ſo eaſily foreſeen, we are not now urged with the neceſſity of ſetting up either of theſe. The great expedient that has been propoſed of late, is to indulge a Liberty of chooſing what Church, and what way of Worſhip any man pleaſes; that is, to grant a publick <hi>Toleration</hi> of divers Religions. But this, though it might gratifie the preſent humor of ſome part of the Nation, and ſerve ſome mens Occaſions bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any Eſtabliſhment, would be quickly diſliked by moſt of thoſe that now contend ſo Zealouſly for it. For there muſt needs be a conſtant Emulation and Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:23"/> betwixt the ſeveral <hi>Tolerated</hi> Parties, which would give a continual Diſturbance; and as ſoon as any of them began to grow Numerous and Powerful, and had any Hopes of ſucceeding, they would preſently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it very neceſſary to impoſe their own Diſcipline upon all the reſt; and this probably might ſoon put an end to the ſo much deſired and magnified way of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Or if we could ſuppoſe them contented to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Freedom to others which they injoyed themſelves, yet it could not poſſibly be avoided, but that this Indulgence muſt ſtrangely multiply our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; while ſome Members of their <hi>Separate</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would take Offence, and withdraw, and make choice of a new Paſtor, and incorporate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another new Church, and that after a while, upon the like Pretences, might be ſplit into another, and another, and ſo on without any ſtop. And then this would certainly ſet open the Gate to a Flood of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſuch monſtrous and extravagant Opinions, as muſt be confeſſed, by the moſt prejudiced Diſſenter, to be of far more dangerous conſequence to the cauſe of Religion than that ſober and pious <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and thoſe few indifferent <hi>Rites</hi> which are now injoined. This the experience of the Late Times found to be true. The Church of <hi>England</hi> was no ſooner overthrown, but ſome of thoſe that had been the moſt forward and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to pull her down, when they ſaw how ſuddenly the ſwarms of other Sectaries increaſed upon them, were forced to acknowledge that the Conſtitution which they had deſtroyed, was a great check and reſtraint to thoſe Errors, which grew Bold and Licencious under the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they had procured. The Biſhops then, who juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been the common Theme of Popular Obloquy, had ſome good Words unwillingly dropt upon them, and their Diligence and Succeſs in ſuppreſſing Abſurd, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:24"/> and many times Blaſphemous Doctrines, was allowed ſome juſt Commendation. That Government which they had traduced and rendered as odious as was poſſible, by all the arts of Defamation that could be uſed, was found upon Trial to be far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, by ſome of its greateſt Enemies, than that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and Confuſion they had contended for with ſo much Violence.</p>
                        <p>But if we cannot be made ſufficiently Apprehenſive of the diſmal Effects, that will almoſt Naturally follow upon a Publick <hi>Toleration;</hi> yet methinks we ſhould now be a little Suſpitious of it, ſince we know it is the main Engine the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been working with theſe many years. If there be no Remedy but that our Church muſt fall, let us not throw it down our ſelves, by methods of their Preſcribing; let us not act as if we were proſecuting the Deſigns of the Conclave; and proceed juſt as if we were governed by the Decrees of the pretended Infallible Chair. We may be aſhamed to look ſo like Tools in the hands of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> when we ſuffer our ſelves to be guided by thoſe meaſures which they had taken, and talk and do as they would have us; as if we were immediately inſpired from <hi>Rome.</hi> For we cannot be ignorant that <hi>Toleration</hi> has been a Device of theirs; and it would not be any part of our Wiſdom to grow unreaſonably fond of the Invention of our Enemies; and think to ſtrengthen the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt by thoſe very means which their Subtilty and Malice had contrived to deſtroy it.</p>
                        <p>But if this Conſideration ſhould be laid aſide; What need can there be otherwiſe, that we ſhould deſire to be Indulged in our departure from a Church, where we may Communicate with a ſafe Conſcience? As we may certainly do in ours; whoſe greateſt Adverſaries have not been able, after the moſt curious Search they could
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:24"/> make, to find out one thing in the whole Conſtitution which they could poſitively affirm to be Forbidden; and till that can be made appear, we muſt ſtill ſay that it cannot be Unlawful. If the <hi>Impoſition</hi> of ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things be thought a ſufficient ground for a <hi>Separation;</hi> (as it is now generally urged, ſince the proof of their Unlawfulneſs is deſpaired of) then we muſt have <hi>Separated</hi> from the Apoſtolical Churches, who had ſome ſuch Uſages, as the Holy Kiſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe Indifferency is acknowledged by their being wholly diſuſed: We muſt have <hi>Separated</hi> from the firſt Churches that ſucceeded them, which had all ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things injoined: We muſt <hi>Separate</hi> at this time from all the Reformed Churches in the World; for there is none of theſe which does not require the uſe of ſuch things, as we ſhould judge cauſe enough to depart from them: Nay, when we have once <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> from the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon this account, we muſt then <hi>Separate</hi> from one another, and every man muſt be a Church by himſelf; for it is impoſſible that any Society, whether meerly Humane, or Chriſtian, ſhould ſubſiſt, without the orderly determination of ſome Indifferent things. And ſure we can never hope to maintain our <hi>Separation</hi> upon ſuch a Principle, as would not only part us from all the Churches that are, or ever were, and tear Chriſtendom into ten thouſand pieces; but ſcarce leaves us ſo much as the Notion of a Church, and makes Chriſtian Communion abſolutely impracticable. Let us not give thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing that Church which has always oppoſed them with the greateſt Vigor, and been the conſtant mark of their Envy, quite Ruined, or extreamly Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by a pernicious Miſtake, that would Divide and Divide us again, and again, and never make any end of Dividing. Let us ſhew at leaſt that well are we incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:25"/> unto Peace, by coming as far as we can; and if there ſhould be any thing that we may poſſibly ſuſpect to be Unlawful, let not this hinder us from joining in thoſe other holy Offices, in which we have not any pretence of a Doubt. Let not our groundleſs Scrupling at a Ceremony, or two, fright us from the whole Worſhip of God, againſt which we have not any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                        <p>And for thoſe that eſteem our Communion in all particulars utterly Unlawful, which I ſuppoſe are but very few, and I know they have but very ſlight Arguments for the ſevere Judgment they paſs upon us; if they will meet, let them do it in the moſt private manner that they can, without any vain Oſtentation of their Numbers, which cannot be any Satisfaction to their Conſciences, but may make their Adherents over for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bold, and tend to the creating of Jealouſies in the Government. And while they are upon theſe terms, they cannot reaſonably expect any Connivance. They might ſooner hope for it from his Majeſties won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and often experienced Clemency; when they ſhall make it appear that their Diſſent is modeſt and humble, and ſuch as has no other but a Religious Deſign in it: Than when they aſſume a high degree of Confidence, and think to extort Indulgencies by Clamors and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and reſolve to Aſſemble openly in Oppoſition to a Royal Command; as if it were a piece of Chriſtian Fortitude to outbrave Authority. Theſe are but ill Methods of courting the Favour of a Prince. But I hope for the future we ſhall all, upon all Occaſions, behave our ſelves as becomes good Subjects, and ſober Chriſtians, and make no Diſturbances neither on a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil nor Eccleſiaſtical account.</p>
                        <p>Let it Pity us at laſt to ſee the Ghaſtly Wounds that are ſtill renewed by the continuance of our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:25"/> Let us have ſome Compaſſion on a Bleeding Church that is ready to Faint, and in eminent Danger of being made a prey to her Enemies, by the unnatural Heats and Animoſities of thoſe that ſhould Support and Defend her. Why ſhould we leave her thus Deſolate and Forlorn, when her preſent Exigencies require our moſt Cordial Aſſiſtance? If the condition of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion were ſuch as God's Laws did not allow, we might forſake her that had forſaken him. But ſince this cannot be Objected againſt her; ſince ſhe exacts no Forbidden thing of us, Let us ſtrengthen her Hands by our unanimous Agreement; and ſince we do not Condemn her Doctrine, let us not Deſpiſe her Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſince the Subſtantials of Religion are the ſame, let not the Circumſtances of external Order and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be any longer an Occaſion of Difference amongſt us. And ſo ſhall we bring Glory to God, a happy Peace to a Divided Church, a conſiderable Security to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and probably Defeat the ſubtle Practices of <hi>Rome,</hi> which now ſtands gaping after All; and hopes by our Diſtractions to repair the loſſes ſhe has ſuffered by the Reformation. May the Wiſdom of Heaven make all Wicked Purpoſes unſucceſsful; and the bleſſed Spirit of Love heal all our Breaches, and proſper the Charitable Endeavours of thoſe that follow after PEACE. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN order to ſtate ſuch caſes as particularly relate to Church-Communion with all poſſible clearneſs, it will be neceſſary to premiſe a brief explication of ſome words, which muſt be uſed in queſtions of this nature, but are not ſo commonly underſtood.</p>
                        <p>As,</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. What is meant by a Church, and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church.</item>
                           <item>2. What Church Communion is.</item>
                           <item>3. What is meant by Fix't Communion and by Occaſional Communion.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Firſt, What is meant by a Church. Now the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſcription I can give of a Church is this, <hi>That the Church is a Body or Society of Men ſeparated from the reſt of the World, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to God, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a Divine Covenant.</hi> I ſhall briefly explain this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:28"/> deſcription to fit it to the meaneſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Then a Church is a Body or Society of Men, for I ſpeak only of the Church in this World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not enter into that diſpute, in what ſenſe Angels belong to the Church.</p>
                        <p>And when I call the Church a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of Men, I oppoſe a <hi>Body</hi> to ſingle <hi>Individuals,</hi> or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men, and to <hi>a confuſed Multitude,</hi> without any order or Union among themſelves. For tho the Church conſiſts of particular Men, and when their Numbers are encreaſed, of great Multitudes, yet the Church conſiſts of ſuch particular Men, not conſidered in a private and ſeparate capacity, but as United into a regular Society, which is called a <hi>Body,</hi> in alluſion to the natural Body, in which all the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are United in an exact Order, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c. For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi> And if the meaneſt Societies cannot ſubſiſt without Order wherein their ſtrength and beauty and uſefulneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, much leſs the Church of God, which is a Society Inſtituted for the moſt ſpiritual and Supernatural Ends.</p>
                        <p>And therefore we find, that God ordained a moſt exact Order and Government in the Jewiſh Church, which for the greater ſtrength and Unity he formed into a religious Common-wealth: And our Bleſſed Saviour ordained the Apoſtles, and committed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church to them, and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, with a promiſe <hi>to be with them to the end of the World.</hi> And the Chriſtian Church with reſpect to the firm and cloſe Union and orderly Diſpoſition of all its <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 21, 22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</note> Parts, is not only called a Body, but a <hi>Spiritual Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>Holy Temple,</hi> and <hi>the Houſe of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:28"/>
                        <p>But then the Church is a Body, or <hi>one</hi> Body, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to many bodies, for Chriſt has but one Body, and one Church, and he is the Saviour of this Body. The Jewiſh Church was but one, and therefore the Chriſtian Church is but one, which is not a new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Church, but is grafted into the Jewiſh ſtock or Root. Believing Jews, and Chriſtians being United into one Church, <hi>built upon the foundation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17, 18.</note> 
                           <hi>corner ſtone:</hi> Who unites Jews and Gentiles into one Church, as the corner ſtone unites both ſides of the Houſe, and holds them together.</p>
                        <p>Upon the ſame account the Church is called the <hi>Building,</hi> the <hi>Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, and we know the Temple was but one, and was to be but one, by the expreſs command and Inſtitution of God. And for the ſame reaſon Chriſt tells us, that there ſhould be but <hi>one Fold under one Shepherd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed it is extreamly abſurd and unreaſonable <note place="margin">John 10. 16.</note> to ſay, that the Chriſtian Church, which is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame foundation, which worſhips the ſame God and Saviour, which profeſſes the ſame Faith, are Heirs to the ſame promiſes, and enjoy all priviledges in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſhould be divided into as diſtinct and ſeparate bodies, tho of the ſame kind and nature, as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are diſtinct Perſons, tho they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame common nature. That is, it is very abſurd to ſay, that where every thing is common, there is not one Community. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> tho they partake of the ſame common nature, yet each of them have a diſtinct eſſence and ſubſiſtence of their own (as it muſt be in natural Beings, otherwiſe there could be but one Man in the World) and this makes them diſtinct Perſons: But where the very nature and eſſence of a Body or Society conſiſts in having all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:29"/> there can be but one Body; and therefore if <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all,</hi> be common to the whole Chriſtian Church, if there be no peculiar Priviledges, which belong to ſome Chriſtians and not to all, to one part of the Church, and not to another, then by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, there is but one Church, one Body, one Communion, one Houſehold and Family: For where there is nothing to Diſtinguiſh and Separate, no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures or Partitions of Divine Appointment, there can be, by Divine Inſtitution, but one Body.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I add, that the Church is a Body or Society of Men ſeparated from the reſt of the World, or called out of the World, as <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, from whence <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is derived, may ſignifie, and is ſo expounded by many Divines, upon which account the Chriſtians are ſo of ten called, the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the Called and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen or Elect People of God, which ſignifies, that the Church is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World by a peculiar and appropriate Faith, by peculiar Laws, by peculiar rites of Worſhip, and peculiar Promiſes and Priviledges, which are not common to the whole World, but only to thoſe, who are received into the Communion of the Church. But there is no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about this matter, and therefore I need add no more about it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Church is a Body of Men united to God and to themſelves by a Divine Covenant: The Church is united to God, for it is a Religious Society, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the Worſhip of God; and they are united among themſelves, and to each other, becauſe it is but one Body, which requires a union of all its parts; as I have already ſhewed, and ſhall diſcourſe more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. But the chief thing to be obſerved here is this, that this union with God, and to each other,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:29"/> which conſtitutes a Church, is made by <hi>a Divine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Thus it was in the Jewiſh Church, God entered into Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and choſe him and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity for his Church and Peculiar People, and gave him Circumciſion for a Sign and Seal of this Covenant. And under the Goſpel God hath made a new Covenant with mankind, in and by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the Mediator of a Better Covenant, founded upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Promiſes;</hi> and this Goſpel Covenant is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Church. For the Chriſtian Church is nothing elſe, but ſuch a Society of Men, as is in Covenant with God through Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe all men will grant, that God only can make or conſtitute a Church. For ſuch perſons, if there were any ſo abſurd, are not worth diſputing with, who dare affirm the Church to be a human Creature, or the invention of Men.</p>
                        <p>And I think it is as plain, that the only viſible way God has of forming a Church (for I do not now ſpeak of the inviſible operations of the Divine Spirit) is by granting a Church-Covenant, which is the Divine Charter, whereon the Church is founded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting ſome perſons with Power and Authority, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others into this Covenant, according to the terms and conditions of the Covenant, and by ſuch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Rites and Forms of Admiſſion, as he is pleaſed to inſtitute, which under the Goſpel is Baptiſm, as under the Law it was Circumciſion.</p>
                        <p>To be taken into Covenant with God, and to be received into the Church, is the very ſame thing. For the Church is a Society of Men, who are in Covenant with God. That can be no Church, which is not in Covenant with God, he is no member of the Church, who is not at leaſt viſibly admitted into Gods Covenant, and whoever is in Covenant with God,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:30"/> is made a member of the Church, by being admitted into Covenant.</p>
                        <p>Now before I proceed, I ſhall briefly obſerve ſome few things, which are ſo plain and evident, if theſe Principles be true, that I need only name them, and yet are of great uſe for the reſolution of ſome follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſes.</p>
                        <p>As 1. That a Covenant-ſtate and Church-ſtate is the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>2. That every profeſt Chriſtian, who is received into Covenant, as ſuch, is a Church member.</p>
                        <p>3. That nothing elſe is neceſſary to make us mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Chriſtian Church but only Baptiſm, which is the Sacrament of our admiſſion into the Chriſtian Covenant. For if Baptiſm, which gives us right to all the Priviledges of the Covenant, does not make us Church members, then a Church-ſtate is no part of the Covenant; then a man may be in Covenant with God through Chriſt, and yet be no member of Chriſt; or he may be a member of Chriſt and no member of his Body, which is the Church.</p>
                        <p>4. That no Church-ſtate can depend upon human Contracts and Covenants, for then a Church would be a human Creature, and a human Conſtitution; whereas a Church can be founded only upon a Divine Covenant. It is true, no man, who is at age, can be admitted to Baptiſm till he profeſs his Faith in Chriſt, and voluntarily undertake the Baptiſmal Vow; but the Independent Church-Covenant betwixt Paſtor and People, is of a very different Nature from this, unleſs any man will ſay, that the voluntary contract and Covenant, which the Independents exact from their members, and wherein they place a Church-ſtate, be part of the Baptiſmal Vow. If it be not, then they found the Church upon a human Covenant, for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:30"/> Chriſt hath made but one Covenant with Mankind, which is contained in the Vow of Baptiſm. If it be, then no Man is a Chriſtian, but an Independent, and then they would do well to ſhew, how the Baptiſmal Vow, which is but one and the ſame for all Mankind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines one Man to be a fixt member of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> Church, another of Mr. <hi>Griffiths,</hi> or any other Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Paſtors; and if they could get over this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, there is another ſtill, why they exact this Church-Covenant of Baptized Chriſtians, before they will admit them to their Communion, if Baptiſm makes them members of their Church.</p>
                        <p>This I think makes it plain, that the Independent Church-Covenant is no part of the Baptiſmal Vow, and then it is no part of the Chriſtian Covenant; and if there be no true Church-ſtate, but what depends on ſuch human Contracts, then the Church owes its being to the will of Men, not to the Covenant of God.</p>
                        <p>5. I obſerve farther, how abſurd it is to gather Churches out of Churches, which already conſiſt of Baptized Chriſtians. Chriſtianity indeed ſeparates us from the reſt of the World, but ſurely it does not ſeparate Chriſtians from each other. The Apoſtles only undertook to Convert Jews and Heathens to the Chriſtian Faith, and to make them members of the Chriſtian Church, which is a ſtate of ſeparation from the World; but theſe Men Convert Chriſtians from Common Chriſtianity, and the Communion of the univerſal Church, to Independency. If the Church be founded on a divine Covenant, we know no Church but what all Chriſtians are made members of by Baptiſm, which is the univerſal Church, the one Body and Spouſe of Chriſt. And to argue from the Apoſtles gathering Churches from among Jews and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:31"/> Heathens, to prove the gathering Churches out of a Chriſtian and National Church, muſt either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a Church, and Church-ſtate is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and Arbitrary thing, and that Men may be very good Chriſtians, and in a ſafe condition without it; or that Baptized Chriſtians, who are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a particular Independent Church, are no better than Jews and Heathens, that is, that Baptiſm it ſelf though a Divine Sacrament and Seal of the Covenant, is of no value, till it be confirmed and ratified by a human Independent Covenant.</p>
                        <p>6. I obſerve, that if the Chriſtian Church be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Divine Covenant, on that new Covenant, which God hath made with Mankind in Chriſt, then there is but one Church of which all Chriſtians are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as there is but one Covenant into which we are all admitted by Baptiſm. For the Church and the Covenant muſt be of an equal extent. There can be but one Church founded upon one Covenant, and all who have an intereſt in the ſame Covenant, are members of the ſame Church.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, tho the diſtance of place, and the neceſſities and conveniences of Worſhip and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, may, and has divided the Church into ſeveral parts and members, and particular Churches, yet the Church cannot be divided into two or more diſtinct and ſeparate Churches, for that deſtroys the unity of the Church: and unleſs they could divide the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant alſo, two Churches, which are not members of each other, cannot partake in the ſame Covenant, but the guilty Divider forfeits his intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant without a new grant.</p>
                        <p>A Prince indeed may grant the ſame Charter to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſtinct Cities and Corporations, but then tho the matter of the Charter be the ſame, their right to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:31"/> it depends upon diſtinct Grants. But if he grant a Charter for the Erecting of ſuch a Corporation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his Charter to the members of that Corporation, thoſe who wilfully ſeparate themſelves from this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to which this Charter was granted, forfeit their intereſt in the Charter, and muſt not think to Erect a new diſtinct Corporation by the ſame Charter.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is here, God hath made a Covenant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> grace with Mankind in Chriſt, and declares that by this one Covenant, he unites all the Diſciples of Chriſt into one Body and Chriſtian Church, who ſhall all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Bleſſings of this Covenant. By Baptiſm we are all received into this Covenant, and admitted members of this one Church; now while we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Unity of this Body, it is evident, that we have a right to all the Bleſſings of the Covenant, which are promiſed to this Body, and to every member of it. But if we divide our ſelves from this Body, and ſet up diſtinct and ſeparate Societies, which we call Churches, but which are not members, nor live in Communion with the one Catholick Church, we cannot carry our Right and Title to the Covenant out of the Church with us.</p>
                        <p>The Goſpel-Covenant is the common Charter of the Chriſtian-Church, and if we are not contented to enjoy theſe Bleſſings in common with other Chriſtians we muſt be contented to go without them. For it is not a particular Covenant, which God makes with particular Separate Churches, but a general Covenant made with the whole Body of Chriſtians, as United in one Communion, and therefore that, which no particular Church has any intereſt in, but as it is a member of the univerſal Church.</p>
                        <p>God hath not made any Covenant in particular with the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:32"/> with the one Body and Church of Chriſt, all the World over; and therefore the only thing, that can give us in particular a right to the Bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is, that we obſerve the conditions of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and live in Unity and Communion with all true Chriſtian Churches in the World, which makes us members of the Catholick Church, to whom the Promiſes are made.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The next thing to be explained is, what is meant by Church-Communion. Now Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſignifies no more then Church-Fellowſhip and Society, and to be in Communion with the Church is to be a member of the Church; and this is called Communion, becauſe all Church members have a common right to Church Priviledges, and a common Obligation to all thoſe Duties and Offices, which a Church relation Exacts from them.</p>
                        <p>I know this word <hi>Communion</hi> is commonly uſed to ſignifie a Perſonal and preſential Communion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Offices: as when Men pray, and hear, and receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper together, they are ſaid to be in Communion with one another and to live in Communion with that Church, with which they joyn in all Acts of Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>Now we muſt acknowledge, that Publick Acts of Worſhip performed in the Communion of the Church, are an Exerciſe of Chriſtian Communion, but Church-Communion is ſomething antecedent to all the Acts and Offices of Communion. For no Man has a right to any Act of Chriſtian Communion, but he, who is in a State of Communion with the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                        <p>What natural Union is in natural Bodies, that Communion is in Bodies Politick, whether Civil or Religious Societies; a member muſt be vitally united to the Body, before it can perform any natural Action
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:32"/> or Office of a member; before the Eye can ſee, or the Feet can walk, or the Ears can hear; and the union of the Eye, or Foot, to the Body, does not conſiſt in ſeeing or walking, but ſeeing and walking are the effects of this Union.</p>
                        <p>Thus in a Body Politick, when Men by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charter are United into one Society, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one common Body, or one Communion; and this gives them right to all the priviledges of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and obliges them to all the Duties and Offices, which their Charter requires of them; but ſhould any Man, who is not regularly admitted into this Society, pretend to the ſame Priviledges, or do ſuch things, as are required of thoſe, who are members of this Body, this would be ſo far from being thought an Act of Communion with them, that it would be cenſured as an unjuſt Uſurpation. Should a Man, who is no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>London,</hi> open his Shop, and drive a trade as other Citizens do, or give his Vote at a Common-Hall, and in all other caſes Act like a Citizen, this would not make him a Citizen, but an Intruder. He is a Foreigner ſtill, and his preſuming to Act like a Citizen, when he is none, is no Act of Communion with that Body, of which he is no member, but juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſes him to cenſure and puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is in the Chriſtian Church, which is one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Society united by a Divine Covenant. Our Communion with the Church conſiſts in being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, which we are made by Baptiſm: The exerciſe of this Communion conſiſts in all thoſe Offices and Duties, which all the members of the Church are obliged to, and which none have any right to perform, but they; ſuch as praying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:33"/>
                        <p>Now ſhould any Man who is no member of the Church, nor owns himſelf to be ſo, intrude into the Church, and Communicate in all holy Offices, this can be no more called an Act of Communion, than it can be ſaid to make him a member of the Church, of which he is no member, and reſolved not to be: Prayers, and receiving the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Acts of Communion, when performed by Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Communion of the Church; but they are no Acts of Communion, when performed by thoſe, who are no Church-members, tho to ſerve a turn, they thruſt themſelves into the Society of the Church.</p>
                        <p>As for Inſtance, ſuppoſe a member of a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, or Independant Conventicle, ſhould, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, at ſome critical time, come to his Pariſh Church, and there hear the Common-Prayer, and Sermon, and receive the Lords Supper, according to the order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> does this make this Man a member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with which he never Communicated before, and it is likely, will never do again? If it does not, all this is no Act of Communion, which can be only between the members of the ſame Body.</p>
                        <p>So that to be in Church-Communion, does not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, meerly to perform ſome ſuch Acts, which are Acts of Communion in the members of the Church, but ſince the decay of Church Diſcipline, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be performed by thoſe, who are not members, which is ſuch an abuſe, as would not have been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Primitive Church, who denyed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to Schiſmaticks, as well as to the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate upon other accounts: but to be in Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſignifies to be a member of the Church, to be Embodyed and Incorporated with it, and I ſuppoſe. what that means, every one knows, who underſtands
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:33"/> what it is to be a member of any Society, of a City, or any Inferior Corporation; which conſiſts of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Duty, and requires all thoſe, who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefits of ſuch a Society, to diſcharge their reſpective truſts and obligations.</p>
                        <p>To be in Communion with, or to be a member of the Church, includes a Right and Title to all thoſe Bleſſings, which God hath promiſed to his Church, and an obligation to all the Duties and Offices of Church Society; as Subjection to the Authority, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Cenſures of the Church; a Communion in Prayers, and Sacraments, and other Religious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and he who deſpiſes the Authority, or deſtroys the Unity of the Church, renounces his memberſhip and Communion with it. Theſe things are extreamly plain, and though Men may cavil for diſputes ſake, yet muſt needs convince them, that no Man is in Communion with a Church, which he is not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of, tho through the defect of Diſcipline, he ſhould ſometimes be admitted to ſome Act of Communion with it; and I ſhall obſerve ſome few things from hence of great uſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Church-Communion primarily and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpects the univerſal Church, not any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church or Society of Chriſtians. For to be in Church-Communion ſignifies to be a member of the Church, or Body of Chriſt, which is but one all the World over. Church Communion does not conſiſt in particular Acts of Communion, which can be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only among thoſe, who are preſent, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to each other, but in memberſhip: now a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is a member of the whole Body, (not meerly of any part of it,) how large ſoever the Body be. All the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> thoſe, who live at St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi> and thoſe at <hi>Tarmouth,</hi> who never ſaw, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:34"/> with each other, are all members of the ſame Kingdom, and by the ſame reaſon, this memberſhip may extend to the remoteſt part of the World, if the Body, whereof we are members, reach ſo far.</p>
                        <p>And therefore we may obſerve, that Baptiſm, which is the Sacrament of our Admiſſion into the Covenant of God, and the Communion of the Church, does not make us members of any particular Church, as ſuch, but of the Univerſal Church; and I obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that a Church-ſtate, which is the ſame thing, with Church-Communion, is founded only on a Divine Covenant; and therefore ſince there is no other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Covenant to make us members of particular Churches, as diſtinguiſht from the Univerſal Church, ſuch particular Church-memberſhip is at beſt but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Invention, and indeed nothing elſe but a Schiſm from the Univerſal Church: which alone, if well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is a ſufficient confutation of Independency, which is a particular Church-State, as diſtinguiſht from all other Churches and Societies of Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I obſerve further, that tho the exerciſe of Church Communion, as to moſt of the particular Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Offices of it, muſt be confined to a particular Church and Congregation (for we cannot Actually joyn in the Communion of Prayers and Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with ſome particular Church) yet every Act of Chriſtian Communion, though performed in ſome particular Church, is and muſt be an Act of Communion with the whole Catholick Church, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Hearing, and receiving the Lords Supper together, does not make us more in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than with any other true and Orthodox part of the Church, tho in the Remoteſt parts of the World. The exerciſe of true Chriſtian Communion in a particular Church, is nothing elſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:34"/> but the exerciſe of Catholick Communion in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, which the neceſſity of affairs requires, ſince all the Chriſtians in the World cannot meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for Acts of Worſhip; But there is nothing in all theſe Acts of Communion, which does more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly Unite us to ſuch a particular Church, than to the whole Chriſtian Church.</p>
                        <p>When we pray together to God, we Pray to him as the Common Father of all Chriſtians, and do not challenge any peculiar intereſt in him, as members of ſuch a particular Church, but as members of the whole Body of Chriſt: when we Pray in the Name of Chriſt, we conſider him as the great High Prieſt, and Saviour of the Body, who powerfully interceeds for the whole Church and for us as members of the Univerſal Church. And we Offer up our Prayers and Thankſgiving, not only for our ſelves and thoſe, who are preſent, but for all Chriſtians all the World over, as our Fellow-members, and Praying for one another is the trueſt notion of Communion of Prayers; for Praying with one another, is only in order to Praying for one another. And thus our Prayers are an exerciſe of Chriſtian Communion, when we Pray to the ſame common Father, through the Merits and Mediation of the ſame common Saviour and Redeemer, for the ſame common Bleſſings, for our ſelves, and the whole Chriſtian Church.</p>
                        <p>Thus when we meet together to Celebrate the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lord, we do not meet as at a private Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but as at the common Feaſt, of Chriſtians: and therefore it is not an Act of particular Church Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but of Catholick Communion. The Supper of our Lord does not ſignifie any other kind of Union and confederation between thoſe Neighbour Chriſtians, who receive together in the ſame Church, than with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:35"/> the whole Body of Chriſt. The Sacramental Bread ſignifies and repreſents all thoſe, for whom Chriſt died, that one Myſtical Body, for which he Offered his Natural Body, which is the Univerſal Church; and our eating of this Bread ſignifies our Union to this Body of Chriſt, and therefore is conſidered, as an Act of true Catholick, not of a particular Church-Communion. And the Sacramental Cup is the Blood of the New Teſtament, and therefore repreſents our Communion in all the Bleſſings of the Covenant, and with all thoſe, who are thus in Covenant with God. So that there is nothing particular in this Feaſt, to make it a private Feaſt, or an Act of Communion with a particular Church, conſidered as particular, but it is the common Feaſt of Chriſtians, and an Act of Catholick Communion.</p>
                        <p>Which by the way plainly ſhews, how groundleſs that ſcruple is againſt mixt Communions, that Men think themſelves defiled by receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with Men, who are vicious. For tho it is a great defect in Diſcipline, and a great reproach to the Chriſtian Profeſſion, when wicked Men are not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and removed from Chriſtian Communion, yet they may as well pretend, that their Communion is defiled by bad Men, who Communicate in any other part of the Church, or any other Congregation, as in that, in which they live and Communicate: For this holy Feaſt ſignifies no other Communion between them, who receive at the ſame time, and in the ſame Company, than it does with all ſincere parts of the Chriſtian Church. It is not a Communion with any Perſons conſidered as preſent, but it is a Communion with the Body of Chriſt and all true members of it, whether preſent or abſent.</p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:35"/>
                        <p>Thoſe who ſeparate from a National Church for the ſake of corrupt profeſſors, though they could form a Society as pure and holy, as they ſeem to deſire, yet are Schiſmaticks in it, becauſe they confine their Communion to their own ſelect Company, and Exclude the whole Body of Chriſtians all the World over, out of it; their Communion is no larger than their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Church, for if it be, then they muſt ſtill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with thoſe Churches, which have corrupt members, as all viſible Churches on Earth have, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will except Independents, becauſe they have the confidence to except themſelves) and then their Separation does not Anſwer its end, which is to avoid ſuch corrupt Communions; and yet if they do confine their Communion to their own gathered Churches, they are Schiſmaticks in dividing themſelves from the Body of Chriſtians; and all their Prayers and Sacraments are not Acts of Chriſtian Communion, but a Schiſmatical Combination.</p>
                        <p>This does not prove indeed, that particular Churches are not bound to reform themſelves, and to preſerve their own Communion pure from corrupt members, unleſs all the Churches in the World, will do ſo too; becauſe every particular Church, whether Dioceſan, or National, has power to reform its own members, and is accountable to God for ſuch neglects of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: but it does prove, that no Church without the guilt of Schiſm, can renounce Communion with other Chriſtian Churches, or ſet up a diſtinct and ſeparate Communion of its own, for the ſake of ſuch corrupt members; which was the pretence of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian</hi> and <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Schiſm of Old, and is ſo of the Independent Schiſm, at this day.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I obſerve further, that our obligation to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Communion with a particular Church, wholly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:36"/> reſults from our obligation to Catholick Communion. The only reaſon why I am bound to live in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any particular Church, is becauſe I am a member of the whole Chriſtian Church, which is the Body of Chriſt, and therefore muſt live in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Chriſtian Church; and yet it is Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to live in Communion with the whole Chriſtian Church, without Actual Communion with ſome part of it; when I am in ſuch a place, where there is a viſible Chriſtian Church; as no member can be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Natural Body, without its being United to ſome part of the Body, for the Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the whole Body conſiſts in the Union of all its parts to each other.</p>
                        <p>Every Act of Chriſtian Communion, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a particular Church, or Congregation, is not properly an Act of particular Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but is the exerciſe of Communion with the whole Church and Body of Chriſt, as I have already proved; but it can be no Act of Communion at all, if it be not performed in the Communion of the Church, which it cannot be, unleſs it be performed in the Communion of ſome particular Church. And this is the only obligation, I know of, to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any particular Church, that as I am a Chriſtian, I am a member of the Body and Church of Chriſt, and in a State of Communion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am bound to maintain Actual Communion with the Chriſtian Church, where-ever I find it, and by Communicating with the Church, wherein I live, if it be a Sound and Orthodox Member of the Chriſtian Church, I maintain Communion with the whole Catholick Church, which is but one Body.</p>
                        <p>So that here is no choice, what Church we will Communicate with, for there is but one Church all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:36"/> the World over, with which we muſt Communicate; and therefore we have nothing elſe to do, but to judge, whether that part of the Church, wherein we live, be ſo Sound and Orthodox, that we may Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with it according to the Principles of Catholick Communion; and if it be, we are bound to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with it, under Peril of Schiſm from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, if we do not.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From hence we may plainly learn the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Separate Communion, and Separate Church. For ſome Men ſeem to be greatly ſenſible of the ſin and miſchief of Schiſm and Separation, but then they uſe great art, ſo to confound the notion of Separation, as that neither they themſelves, nor any one elſe, ſhall ever be able to underſtand what it is, whereas if they will allow, that there is, or ever can be, any ſuch thing as Separation from the Church, it is as eaſie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what Separation is, as what it is for a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be divided from the Body.</p>
                        <p>For if there be but one Church, and one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of which all true Chriſtians, and Chriſtian Churches, are, or ought to be members, then thoſe Churches, which are not members of each other, are Separate Churches. It is not enough indeed to prove a Separation, that two Congregations meet in ſeveral places for Worſhip, for this is done by all the Pariſh-Churches of <hi>England,</hi> who are in the ſame Communion, but yet hold diſtinct and Separate Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, as to Local Separation. Nor is it ſufficient to prove, that there is no Separation, becauſe theſe differing Churches agree in all the Articles of Faith, and eſſentials of worſhip; For thus the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did, who yet were Schiſmaticks from the Catholick Church. But where there are two Churches, which are not members of each other,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:37"/> there is a Schiſm, tho they agree in every thing elſe, but in one Communion; and where Churches own each others Communion, as members of the ſame Body, there is no Schiſm, though they are as diſtant from each other in place, as Eaſt and Weſt.</p>
                        <p>And it is as eaſie to underſtand, what it is for two Churches to be members of each other; but to make this as plain, as I can, and as far, as it is poſſible, to prevent all Evaſions, and Subterfuges, I ſhall lay down ſome few rules according to the Principles of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, whereby we may certainly know, what Churches are in Communion with each other, and which are Separate and Schiſmatical Conventicles.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There muſt be but one Church, in one place, according to that Ancient Rule of the Catholick Church, that there muſt be but one Biſhop in a City; and this was obſerved in the Apoſtolical times, that in the greateſt and moſt Populous Cities, and where there were the greateſt number of Converts, yet there was but one Church, ſuch as <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. this is acknowledged by the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents themſelves, who endeavour hence to prove, that there were no more Chriſtians in any of thoſe Cities, than could meet together in one place for Acts of Worſhip, which is a mighty groundleſs Surmiſe, and not much for the credit of the Chriſtian Church, as has been often ſhewn by learned Men, both Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal and Presbyterian Divines.</p>
                        <p>And there is an evident reaſon, why this ſhould be ſo, becauſe there is no other Rule of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for private Chriſtians, but to Communicate in all Religious Offices, and all Acts of Government and Diſcipline, with thoſe Chriſtians, with whom they live; for to renounce the ordinary Communion of any Chriſtians, or true Chriſtian Church, is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:37"/> the Unity and Communion of the Church, and to withdraw our ſelves from ordinary Communion with the Church, in which we live, into diſtinct and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Societies for Worſhip, is to renounce their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and when there is not a neceſſary cauſe for it, is a Schiſmatical Separation.</p>
                        <p>So that diſtinct and particular Churches, which are in Communion with each other, muſt have their diſtinct bounds and limits, as every member has its Natural and proper place and ſituation in the Body. But when there is one Church within the Bowels of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a new Church gathered out of a Church already conſtituted; and formed into a diſtinct and Separate Society, this divides Chriſtian Communion, and is a notorious Schiſm. Theſe Churches cannot be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each other, becauſe they ought to be but one Church, and therefore to form and gather a new Church, is to divide and Separate the members of the ſame Church from each other.</p>
                        <p>This is the plain caſe of the Presbyterian and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Churches, and thoſe other Conventicles of Sectaries, which are among us; they are Churches in a Church, Churches formed out of the National Church, by which means Chriſtians, who live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, refuſe to Worſhip God in the ſame Aſſemblies, and have bitter Envyings and Contentions, for the Honour and Purity of their ſeveral Churches.</p>
                        <p>If all Chriſtians are members of the one Body of Chriſt, nothing can juſtifie the diſtinction of Chriſtians into ſeveral Churches, but only ſuch a diſtance of place, as makes it neceſſary and expedient to put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct and Government of ſeveral Biſhops, for the great Edification of the Church, in the more eaſie and regular Adminiſtration of Diſcipline, and all holy Offices; and therefore nothing can juſtifie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:38"/> the gathering of a Church out of a Chriſtian Church, and dividing Neighbour Chriſtians into diſtinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions.</p>
                        <p>Churches at a diſtance may be diſtinct Churches under their diſtinct Biſhops, but yet in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but diſtinct Churches in the ſame place can never be of the ſame Communion, for then they would Naturally Unite and Cement into one. There muſt either be Antibiſhops, or Schiſmatical Presbyters, ſet up in oppoſition to their Biſhops, under different and oppoſite Rules of Worſhip and Diſcipline, which makes them Rival and oppoſite Churches, not members of each other. From hence I think, it plainly appears, that all Separation from a Church, wherein we live, unleſs there be neceſſary reaſons for it, is Schiſm; and we cannot juſtifie ſuch diſtinct Churches within one another, from the examples of other diſtinct Churches, whoſe bounds, and limits, and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo, are diſtinct and ſeparate.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is plain, thoſe are Separate Churches, which divide from the Communion of any Church, from any diſlike of its Doctrine, Government, or Worſhip, for in this caſe, it is plain, they leave the Church, and form themſelves into a new Church, out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, from whence they went, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not think it ſafe to continue one Body with it.</p>
                        <p>This has often made me wonder, what thoſe Men mean, who take all occaſions to quarrel at our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and aſſign a great many reaſons, why they cannot Communicate with us, and yet at the ſame time will not own, that they have made any Separation from us. What middle ſtate now ſhall we find for theſe Men, who will neither continue in the Church, nor allow themſelves to be out of it?</p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:38"/>
                        <p>It is poſſible for two particular Churches to be in Communion with each other, and yet not Actually to Communicate together, becauſe diſtance of place will not permit it; but for two Churches to renounce each others Communion, or at leaſt to withdraw or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Communion from each other, from a profeſſed diſlike, and yet ſtill to continue in a ſtate of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with one another, is a down right contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To be in Communion is to be members of the ſame Body and Society, and he that can prove, and he that can believe, two oppoſite Societies, founded upon contrary principles, and Acting by contrary Rules, and purſuing contrary ends, to the Ruin and Subverſion of each other, to be the ſame Body, and the ſame Society, are very wonderful Men to me.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thoſe are Separate Churches, who do not own each others members, as their own Actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion during our reſidence in any certain place, muſt be confined to that particular Church, in which we live, if it be a ſound part of the Chriſtian Church; but Church-memberſhip is not confined to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church. I am no otherwiſe a member of any particular Church, then I am of the Univerſal Church, which gives me a right of Memberſhip and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all the particular Churches of the World. Now I would ask whether every Baptized Chriſtian, who by Baptiſm is made a member of the Catholick Church, and has not forfeited this right by a Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous life, be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> a member of an Independent Church; if he be not (as it is plain, by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Independency, he is not, for Independent Church-memberſhip is not founded on Baptiſm, but on a particular Church-Covenant;) then Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a Separate Communion from the Catholick Church; for the members of the Catholick Church
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:39"/> are not by being ſo, made the members of an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Church, and therefore an Independent Church is a diſtinct and ſeparate Body from the Catholick-Church.</p>
                        <p>Nay I would know whether a member of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Church by being ſo, becomes a member of another Independent Church; if he does not, as it is plain, he don't, (for every Independent Church is founded upon a particular Church-Covenant between ſuch a particular Paſtor and particular members) then every Independent Church is a diſtinct and Separate Body from all other Independent Churches, and ſo they are all Schiſmaticks to each other, as not preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Unity of the Body.</p>
                        <p>And tho Independent Churches ſhould be ſo civil to each other, as to admit each others members to ſome Acts of Communion, yet this is matter of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, not of right, and therefore their conſtitution is Schiſmatical. It is like two Neighbour Families, which hold good correſpondence with each other, and often viſit one another, and Eat, and Drink together, but yet remain very diſtinct Families, and have all their concerns apart and ſeparate. But the Chriſtian Church is but one Houſhold and Family, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever makes two Families of it, is a Schiſmatick.</p>
                        <p>Thus let me ask, whether the Epiſcopal, and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Churches in the ſame Chriſtian Kingdom, be one Church, and members of each other, and own each others members, as ſuch, to be members of their own Body and Church; If they do not, as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they don't, from their holding diſtinct and ſeparate Aſſemblies, under a diſtinct kind and ſpecies of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which both of them aſſert to be inſtituted by Chriſt, and to be eſſential to the conſtitution of the Church, from their forming themſelves into diſtinct Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:39"/> under different Governors, which have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as ſuch with each other, (which yet is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Communion of particular Churches, that their Governors ſhould be in Communion with each other) from their Condemning each others conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and particular modes of Worſhip, and their great endeavours to draw away members from each other; which neceſſarily ſuppoſes, that they do not look upon each others members, as their own. I ſay, if from theſe conſiderations it appears, that they are not, and do not think themſelves to be, one Body, nor members of each other, then they are two ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Churches, and the Church, which makes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is the Schiſmatick.</p>
                        <p>And indeed we may as well ſay, that a Monarchy, and Ariſtocracy, and Democracy in the ſame Nation, with their diſtinct Governours, and diſtinct Subjects, and diſtinct Laws, that are always at Enmity and War with each other, are but one Kingdom, as to aſſert, that the Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Churches in <hi>England,</hi> are but one Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The laſt thing to be explained, is, what is meant by fixt or conſtant, and by occaſional Communion. Now this is a queſtion, which would grievouſly have puzl'd St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other Ancient Fathers, who never heard but of one ſort of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For indeed there is no place for this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſtant and occaſional Communion, according to the Principles of Catholick Communion. To be in Communion with the Church, is to be a member of the Church, and I take it for granted, that a member ſignifies a fixt and conſtant, not an occaſional mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; not a member, which is one day a member, and the next day upon his own voluntary choice is no member, which is a member or no member, juſt as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:40"/> occaſion ſerves. And if Church-memberſhip be a fixt and conſtant relation in it ſelf conſidered, then the Duties of this relation are fixt and conſtant alſo. And therefore for the underſtanding of theſe Terms, which were unknown to Antiquity, we muſt conſult the meaning of our Modern Authors, who were the firſt Inventors of them.</p>
                        <p>Now by fixt Communion they mean an Actual and conſtant Communicating with ſome one particular Church, as fixt members of it; occaſional Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to Pray, and Hear, and receive the Sacrament, at ſome other Church, (of which they do not own themſelves to be members) as occaſion ſerves; that is, either to gratifie their own Curioſity, or to ſerve ſome ſecular end, or to avoid the Imputation of Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>Now this diſtinction is owing to ſuch Principles, as I have evidently proved to be very great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
                        <p>For if to be in Communion with the Church ſignifie to be a member of it, and that not of any particular Church, as diſtinguiſht from the whole Catholick Church, but to be a member of the one Body of Chriſt, and of every ſound part of it; then our Communion with the Church is as fixt, as our relation and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip is, and I think no Man, who underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, will talk of an occaſional member.</p>
                        <p>If no Man can perform any Act of Communion with a Church, of which he is no member (ſince all Acts of Communion have a neceſſary relation to a ſtate of Communion, and that, which is an Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in a member, is no Act of Communion, when performed by him, who is no member, as I have already proved) then it is as plain a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to talk of an occaſional Act of Communion, as of occaſional memberſhip; and there can be no place
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:40"/> for occaſional Communion with a Church, of which we are no members, unleſs we will ſay, that a Man, who is not in Communion, may exerciſe Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church.</p>
                        <p>If all the Acts of Chriſtian Communion, which reſpect Chriſtian Worſhip, ſuch as Prayer, receiving the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho performed in a particular Church, be not Acts meerly of a particular Church-Communion, but of Catholick Communion, with the whole Chriſtian Church, and every ſound part of it, then every true Catholick Chriſtian, is not only in a fixt ſtate of Communion with the Catholick Church, but lives in as conſtant an exerciſe of Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all Sound and Orthodox Churches, as he does with that Church, in which he lives; for every Act of Worſhip, which is an Act of Communion with that particular Church, in which it is performed (if that Church be in Catholick Communion) is an Act of Communion with the whole Catholick Church, and therefore the very exerciſe of Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is equally fixt and conſtant, or equally occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with the whole Catholick Church.</p>
                        <p>There is a ſenſe indeed, wherein we may be ſaid to be members of one particular Church conſidered as diſtinct from all other particular Churches, but that principally conſiſts in Government and Diſcipline; every Chriſtian is a member of the whole Chriſtian Church, and in Communion with it, but he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the immediate Inſtruction and Government of his own Biſhop, and Presbyters, and is bound to Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Communion with them; and this conſtitutes a particular Church, in which all Acts of Worſhip, and all Acts of Diſcipline and Government, are under the direction and conduct of a particular Biſhop. And when Neighbour Biſhops unite into one Body, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:41"/> agree upon ſome common Rules of Government, and the Adminiſtration of Religious Offices, this makes them a Patriarchal or National Church, and thus by ſubmitting to the Government and Diſcipline of ſuch particular or united Biſhops, we become members of a Dioceſan or National Church, conſidered as diſtinct from other Dioceſan or National Churches; But this does not confine our Church-memberſhip and Communion to ſuch a particular Church, tho it ſtrictly oblige us to conform to the Worſhip, and Diſcipline, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Church, wherein we live, while it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes nothing on us inconſiſtent with the Principles of Catholick Communion.</p>
                        <p>But tho particular Chriſtians are more peculiarly obliged to obſerve the Rites and Uſages, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Government and Diſcipline of the Church, wherein they live, and to maintain Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, (and upon this account may in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner be called the members of that Church) yet every Act of Communion performed in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church is an Act of Catholick Communion; and an exerciſe of Chriſtian Communion with the whole Church, and every ſound part of it. Baptiſm makes us members of the whole Church, and gives us a right to Communion with every ſound part of it; every Act of Chriſtian Communion in a particular Church is a vertual Communion with the whole Church, with all particular Churches, which live in Communion with each other; and notwithſtanding my relation to a particular Church, by my conſtant Abode and Habitation in it, when ever I travel into any other Church, I Communicate with them as a member; ſo that wherever I Communicate, whether in that Church, in which I uſually live, or in any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, where I am accidentally preſent, my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:41"/> Communion is of the ſame Nature, that is, I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate as a member of the Church, and it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, I ſhould Communicate otherwiſe; for I have no right to Communion, but as a member, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I can do, can be an Act of Communion, if I be not, and do not own my ſelf to be a member.</p>
                        <p>And yet this is the occaſion of this miſtake about Fixt and Occaſional Communion; that according to the Laws of our Church, which are founded on great and wiſe reaſons, and indeed according to the Laws of Catholick Communion, every Chriſtian is bound to Communicate with that part of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lives; now Men may have Houſes in different Pariſhes, or diſtinct Dioceſſes, or may Travel into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Country, and Communicate with the Churches, which they find in thoſe places, where they are, or they may ſometimes go to Prayers, or hear a Sermon, or receive the Lords Supper at another Pariſh-Church; now our ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with thoſe Churches, where our conſtant Abode is, may be called conſtant Communion, and our Communion with thoſe Churches, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally viſit, and Communicate with, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led occaſional Communion; and all this without Schiſm, becauſe we ſtill Communicate, either with the ſame National Church, or (which is often the caſe of Travellers) with ſome other ſound part of the Catholick Church, of which we are alſo members, and ſo ſtill keep in the ſame Communion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with no Churches, but thoſe, of which we own our ſelves members; as being all in the ſame Communion; as being either ſincere members of the National or Catholick Church.</p>
                        <p>From hence our Diſſenters Conclude, that their Communion with an Independent, or Presbyterian,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:42"/> Church, of which they profeſs themſelves fixt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is as conſtant with their occaſional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when to ſerve ſome preſent turn, they hear the Prayers, and receive the Sacraments with us; as our fixt Communion with our Pariſh-Churches is, with our occaſional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, with other Pariſh-Churches; which no Body accounts Schiſm, tho when it is too frequent and cauſeleſs, it is a great diſorder.</p>
                        <p>But the difference between theſe two is vaſtly great, for in the Firſt caſe, we only Communicate with ſuch Churches, which are all in Communion with each other, and therefore he, who is a member of one, is a member of them all, and Communicates with them, wherever he is, as a member. But he, who is a fixt member of a Presbyterian, or Independent Church, cannot Communicate ſo much as occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a member, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a member not only of another particular but of a ſeparate Church; and it is impoſſible for any Man, who is one with himſelf, to be a member of two ſeparate Churches, and whatever Acts of Worſhip we joyn in with other Churches, of which we are no members, they are not properly Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                        <p>Having thus premiſed the explication of theſe terms, what is meant by <hi>Church,</hi> and what is meant by <hi>Church-Communion,</hi> and what is meant by <hi>Fixt or Conſtant,</hi> and <hi>occaſional Communion,</hi> the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theſe things, will make it very eaſie to reſolve thoſe caſes, which Immediately reſpect Church-Communion, and I ſhall Inſtance in theſe three.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Whether Communion with ſome Church or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially when the Church is divided into ſo many Sects and Parties, be a neceſſary Duty, incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on all Chriſtians.</p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:42"/>
                        <p n="2">2. Whether conſtant Communion with that Church, with which occaſional Communion is Lawful, be a neceſſary Duty.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whether it be Lawful for the ſame perſon, to Communicate with two ſeparate Churches.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Caſe</hi> 1. Whether Communion with ſome Church <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe </seg>1</label> or other, eſpecially when the Church is divided into ſo many Sects and Parties, be a neceſſary Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on all Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>Now methinks the reſolution of this is as plain, as whether it be neceſſary for every Man to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. For every Chriſtian is Baptized into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, and muſt continue a Member of the Church, till he renounce his Memberſhip by Schiſm, or Infidelity, or be caſt out of the Church by Eccleſiaſtical cenſures.</p>
                        <p>Baptiſm incorporates us into the Chriſtian Church, that is, makes us Members of the Body of Chriſt, which is his Church and is frequently ſo called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For there is but <hi>one Body and one Spirit, Eph.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 23. 4. 12.</note> 4. 4. one Chriſtian Church, which is animated and governed by the one Spirit of Chriſt. And we are all Baptized into this one Body. <hi>For as the Body is one, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Col. 1. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>hath many Members,</hi> and all the members <hi>of that one Body, being many, are one Body, ſo alſo is Chriſt,</hi> that is, the Chriſtian Church, which is the Body of Chriſt, of which he is the Head; <hi>for by one Spirit we are all Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12, 13.</note> 
                           <hi>into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be bond or Free, and are all made to drink into one Spirit; for the body is not one member, but many.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now I have already proved, that Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is nothing elſe, but Church-Memberſhip, to be in Communion with the Church, and to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, ſignifying the ſame thing. And I think, I need not prove, that to be in a ſtate of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:43"/> contains both a right, and an Obligation to Actual Communion. He, who is a member of the Church, may Challenge all the Priviledges of a member, among which Actual Communion is none of the leaſt; to be admitted to all the Acts and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Chriſtian-Communion, to the Communion of Prayers and Sacraments, and all other Chriſtian Duties, which no Man who is not a member of the Church, has any right to. And he who is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is bound to perform all thoſe Duties and Offices, which are Eſſential to Church Communion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is bound to Communicate with the Church in Religious Aſſemblies, to joyn in Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to attend publick Inſtructions, and to live like a member of the Church.</p>
                        <p>But to put this paſt all doubt, <hi>that external and actual Communion is an eſſential Duty of a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> I ſhall offer theſe plain proofs of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Baptiſm makes us Members of the viſible Church of Chriſt, but there can be no viſible Church without viſible Communion, and therefore every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Member, by vertue of his Memberſhip, is bound to external and viſible Communion, when it may be had.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This is eſſential to the notion of a Church, as it is a Body and Society of Chriſtians. For all Bodies and Societies of Men are Inſtituted for the ſake of ſome common Duties and Offices to be performed by the Members of it. A Body of Men is a Community, and it is a ſtrange kind of Community, in which every Member may act by it ſelf, without any Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with other Members of the ſame Body. And yet ſuch a kind of Body as this, the Chriſtian Church is, if it be not an eſſential Duty of every Member, to live in the exerciſe of viſible Communion with the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:43"/> Church, when he can. For there is the ſame Law for all Members, and either all or none, are bound to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Communion.</p>
                        <p>But this is more abſurd ſtill, when we conſider, that the Church is ſuch a Body, as conſiſts of variety of Members, of different Offices and Officers, which are of no uſe without actual and viſible Communion of all its Members.</p>
                        <p>To what purpoſe did Chriſt appoint ſuch variety of Miniſters in his Church, <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11, 12.</note> 
                           <hi>Paſtors, and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt;</hi> to what purpoſe has he inſtituted a ſtanding Miniſtry in his Church, to offer up the Prayers of the Faithful to God, to inſtruct, exhort, reprove, and adminſter the Chriſtian Sacraments, if private Chriſtians are not bound to maintain Communion with them, in all Religious Offices?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nay the Nature of Chriſtian Worſhip obliges us to Church-Communion. I ſuppoſe, no Man will deny, but that every Chriſtian is bound to Worſhip God according to our Saviours Inſtitution: and what that is, we cannot learn better, than from the Example of the Primitive Chriſtians, of whom St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us this account, that <hi>they continued Stedfaſt in the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 2. 41.</note> 
                           <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine, and Worſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That which makes any thing in a Strict ſenſe, an Act of Church-Communion is, that it is performed in the Fellowſhip of the Apoſtles, or in Communion with the Biſhops and Miniſters of the Church; They are appointed to Offer up the Prayers of Chriſtians to God in his Name; and therefore tho the private devotions of Chriſtians are acceptable to God, as the Prayers of Church-Members, yet none but publick Prayers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:44"/> which are Offered up by Men who have their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from Chriſt, to Offer theſe Spiritual Sacrifices to God, are properly the Prayers of the Church, and Acts of Church-Communion. If then we muſt Offer up our Prayers to God according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, that is, by the hands of perſons Authorized and ſet apart for that purpoſe; we muſt of neceſſity joyn in the Actual and Viſible Communion of the Church.</p>
                        <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of Chriſtian Worſhip, and we cannot Celebrate this Feaſt, but in Church-Communion; for this is a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> a common Supper, or Communion-Feaſt, which in all Ages of the Church, has been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by Conſecrated Perſons, and in Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for it loſes its Nature and Signification, when it is turned into a private Maſs, ſo that if every Chriſtian is bound to the Actual performance of true Chriſtian Worſhip, he is bound to an Actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. We may obſerve further; that Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is exerciſed only about Church-Communion, which neceſſarily ſuppoſes, that all Chriſtians, who are Church-Members and in a State of Communion, are bound to all the Acts of external and viſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church. The exerciſe of Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority conſiſts in Receiving in, or Shutting out of the Church. To receive into the Church, is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to all external Acts of Communion, to Shut, or Caſt out of the Church, is to deny them the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and viſible Communion of the Church; not to allow them to Pray, or receive the Lords Supper, or perform any Religious Offices in the publick Aſſemblies of the Church. Now all this Church Authority would ſignifie nothing, were not External and Actual Communion, both the Priviledge and Duty of every Chriſtian; and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:44"/> yet this is all the Authority Chriſt hath given to His Church.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And to confirm all this, nothing is more plain in Scripture, than that Separation from a Church, is to withdraw from the viſible Communion of it, and there can be no Notion of Separation without this; now if Separation from Religious Aſſemblies be to break Communion, then to live in Communion with the Church requires our Actual Communicating with the Church in all Religious Duties.</p>
                        <p>And that this is the true Notion of Separation is eaſily proved from the moſt expreſs teſtimonies; 2 Cor. 6. 17. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you:</hi> Where, <hi>come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate,</hi> plainly ſignifies, to forſake the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Idolaters, not to Communicate with them in their Idolatrous Worſhip; So that not to joyn with any Men or Church in their Idolatrous Worſhip, is to Separate from their Communion, which is a very Godly Separation, when the Worſhip is Idolatrous and Sinful, but a Schiſmatical Separation, when it is not. Thus St. <hi>John</hi> tells us of the Ancient Hereticks, <hi>They went out from us becauſe they were not of us, for if</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 John. 2. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>they had been of us, they would, no doubt, have continued with us, but they went out, that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us.</hi> Where their going out from them, plainly ſignifies, their forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian Aſſemblies, upon which account the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> admoniſhes the Chriſtians, <hi>not to forſake the Aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> in which he <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> refers to the Separation of thoſe Ancient Hereticks.</p>
                        <p>And thus accordingly to have Fellowſhip or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any, is to partake with them in their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:45"/> Religious Myſteries. By this Argument St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for Eating of the Idols Feaſt; becauſe they were Sacrifices to Evil Spirits, and by partaking of thoſe Sacrifices they had Communion with them. <hi>But I ſay, that the things, which the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 20, 21.</note> 
                           <hi>Gentiles Sacrifice, they Sacrifice to Devils, and not to God, and I would not that you ſhould have Fellowſhip with Devils. Ye cannot Drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils, ye cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and of the Table of Devils.</hi> So that, tho we muſt firſt be in a ſtate of Communion with Chriſt, and his Church, muſt firſt be received into Covenant, and by Baptiſm be incorporated into the Chriſtian Church, before we have any right to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with this Church; yet no Man can preſerve his Church-ſtate without Actual Communion, no Man has Communion with Chriſt, or his Church, but he, who Actually Communicates in all Religious Offices, and Chriſtian Inſtitutions; a ſtate of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion confers a right to Communicate, but Actual Communion conſiſts in the exerciſe of Communion, and a right to Communicate without Actual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is worth nothing, as no right or priviledge is without the Exerciſe of it; for enjoyment conſiſts in Acts, and all the Bleſſings of the Goſpel, all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Chriſtian Communion, are conveyed to us by Actual Communion. So that if we would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Bleſſings of Chriſt, if we would Reap the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Church-Communion, we muſt live in Actual Communion, and not content our ſelves with a dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and uſeleſs right, which we never bring into Act.</p>
                        <p>This is ſufficient to prove, the neceſſity of Actual Communion with the Chriſtian Church, when it may be had, for where it cannot be had, Non-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is no Sin, for we are not obliged to Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:45"/> he who lives in a Country, or travels through any Country, where there is no true Chriſtian Church to Communicate with, cannot enjoy Actual Communion; the right and Duty of Communion continues, tho neceſſity may ſuſpend the Act. But the greater difficulty is, whether it be not Lawful, to ſuſpend our Communion with any particular Churches, when we ſee the Church divided into a great many Parties and Factions, which refuſe Communion with each other, which is the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate of the Church at this day among us, Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, all Separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from each other, and from hence ſome conclude it Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſuſpend Communion with all the divided Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which is juſt ſuch a reaſon for a Total ſuſpenſion of Church-Communion, as the different and contrary opinions in Religion are for Scepticiſm and infidelity. Becauſe there are a great many kinds of Religions in the World, and a great many divided Sects of the Chriſtian Religion, therefore ſome Men will be of no Religion; and becauſe the Chriſtian Church is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a great many oppoſite and Separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, therefore others will be of no Church; and the reaſon is as ſtrong in one caſe, as it is in the other, that is, indeed it holds in neither: For it is poſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, which is the true Religion, notwithſtanding all theſe different and contrary perſwaſions about it, and it is equally poſſible to find out, which of theſe divided Communions is a true and Sound Member of the Catholick Church, and when we know that, we are bound to maintain Communion with it.</p>
                        <p>Indeed if ſuch Diviſions and Separations, excuſe us from Actual Communion with the Church, Actual Communion never was, and is never likely to be a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:46"/> Duty long together; for there never was any ſtate of the Church ſo happy long together, as to be without diviſions; even in the Apoſtles times, there were thoſe, who Separated from the Communion of the Apoſtles, and ſet up private Conventicles of their own, and ſo it has been in all ſucceeding Ages of the Church, and ſo it is likely to continue, and if we are not bound to Communicate with the Church, while there are any Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks, who divide from the Church, farewell to all Church Communion in this World.</p>
                        <p>Should any Man indeed Travel into a Strange Country, and there find a Schiſm in the Chriſtian Church, it were very fitting for him to Suſpend Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with either Party, till he had opportunity to acquaint himſelf with the ſtate of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, ſo as to judge, which party is the Schiſmatick; and then he is bound (if he underſtand their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) to Communicate with the Sound and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox part of the Catholick Church, which he finds in that place. But this does not reach the caſe of thoſe, who are conſtant Inhabitants of the place, where the Schiſm is; for they muſt not live in a Sceptical ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of Communion all their days.</p>
                        <p>And there is one plain Rule to direct all Men in this Inquiry; That wherever there is a Church Eſtabliſht by publick Authority, if there be nothing Sinful in its Conſtitution and Worſhip, we are bound to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with that Church, and to reject the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all other Parties and Sects of Chriſtians. For the advantage always lies on the ſide of Authority, no publick eſtabliſhment can juſtifie a Sinful Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but if there be nothing Sinful in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the National Church, which is Eſtabliſht by publick Authority, to Separate from ſuch a Church is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:46"/> both diſobedience to the Supreme Authority in the State, and a Schiſm from the Church.</p>
                        <p>But it will be convenient to conſider, what theſe Men mean by ſuſpending Communion. For is it Lawful for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man during theſe Church divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among us, never to Worſhip God in any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Religious Aſſemblies? Never to Pray, nor Hear, nor receive the Lords Supper together? If this were ſo, it were the moſt Effectual way in the World to thruſt out all Religion.</p>
                        <p>But this they will not, they dare not ſay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Suſpending Communion they mean, that in caſe of ſuch diviſions they may refuſe to enter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fixt and ſetled Members of any Church, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate occaſionally with them all.</p>
                        <p>But I have already obſerved how abſurd this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of fixt and occaſional Communion is. For no Act of Religion is an Act of Communion (not ſo much as of occaſional Communion) which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Communion of the Church; and no Man is in Communion with the Church, who is not a Member of it, and whoever is a Member of the Church is a fixt and not an occaſional Member; and whatever Church he Communicates with, tho it may be, it is but once in a Year, or once in his life, as he occaſionally Travels that way, yet he Communicates as a fixt Member of the Catholick Church, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sound part of the Catholick Church; for a fixt Member does not ſignifie our fixt abode, or conſtant Acts of Communion in any particular Church, but our ſtate of Communion, and fixt and permanent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the whole Chriſtian Church, and every part of it, and therefore tho a particular Act of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be performed upon ſome particular occaſion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:47"/> with ſuch a particular Church, yet it is not an Act of occaſional, but of fixt Communion, becauſe tho I Communicate but once and that occaſionally, yet I Communicate as a Member of the Church, which is not an occaſional but a fixt Relation.</p>
                        <p>So that when Men Communicate occaſionally, as they ſpeak, with all the different Parties of Chriſtians in a divided Church, they either Communicate with none, or Communicate with all of them. If they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form theſe Acts of Communion, without owning their relation to them, as Members, then they are in Communion with none of them, notwithſtanding all theſe pretended Acts of occaſional Communion, and ſo they live in Communion with no Church, which yet I hope, I have made it appear to be the Duty of every Chriſtian to do; if they Communicate with all theſe divided Parties, as Members, then they are in Communion with many Separate Churches, are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Separate and Oppoſite Bodies, that is, they are contrary to themſelves, and on one ſide or other, are certain to be Schiſmaticks, but this will appear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from conſidering the two following Caſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Caſe</hi> 2. The Second Caſe is this; <hi>Whether conſtant</hi> 
                           <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe </seg>2</label> 
                           <hi>Communion be a Duty, where occaſional Communion is Lawful.</hi> I have already made it appear, that the very notion of conſtant and occaſional Communion is abſurd, and a Contradiction to all the principles of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, and therefore there is no place for this diſtinction, nor for this queſtion, every Chriſtian, as a Chriſtian, is a fixt Member of the whole Chriſtian Church, and of every Sound part of it, and for Men to talk of being Members of any one particular Church, in diſtinction from all other particular Churches, of which they will not own themſelves Members, is a Schiſmatical notion of Church-Memberſhip, becauſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:47"/> it divides the Chriſtian Church into diſtinct Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and therefore into diſtinct Bodies, which makes the one Church and one Body of Chriſt, not one, but many Bodies: for if every particular Church has ſuch a number of Members, which are Members only of that particular Church, wherein they are fixt, and are not Members of any other particular Church, then every particular Church is a diſtinct and entire Body by it ſelf, which has particular Members of its own, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to no other Body; juſt as every particular Man has his own Body, which conſiſts of ſuch a number of Members, united to each other, and diſtinct from all other Bodies.</p>
                        <p>The plain ſtate of the Caſe in ſhort is this: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Chriſtian is in Communion with the whole Chriſtian Church, that is, is a Member of the whole Church; but he muſt perform the Acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in ſome particular Church, and the only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference between conſtant and occaſional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is this; that we muſt perform the conſtant Acts of Communion in that part of the Catholick Church, in which we conſtantly live, and Communicate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally with that part of the Church, in which we are occaſionally preſent; and therefore there never can be any Competition between conſtant and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Communion in the ſame place. I cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate conſtantly with that Church in which I Communicate occaſionally, unleſs I remove my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and turn an occaſional preſence into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſetled abode; nor can I without ſin Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate only occcaſionally with that Church, with which I may and ought to Communicate conſtantly, as being conſtantly preſent there, for this is only to do that ſometimes, which I ought to do always. This is like a Mans living occcaſionally in his own Houſe,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:48"/> which ſignifies, that for the moſt part he is a ſtranger at home.</p>
                        <p>There cannot be two diſtinct Churches in the ſame place, one for occaſional, and another for conſtant Communion, without Schiſm, For it is evident, theſe are two diſtinct Communions, and that our relation to them is as different, as it is to a Houſe we live in, and to an Inn, where we lodge for a Night.</p>
                        <p>So that there is no foundation for this Inquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, who underſtand the true Principles of Catholick-Communion; It never can be a Caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whether I ſhould Communicate conſtantly or occaſionally with ſuch a Church, unleſs it be a Caſe of Conſcience, whether I ſhould live conſtantly or occaſionally within the bounds and juriſdiction of ſuch a Church; for where my conſtant abode is, there my conſtant Communion muſt be, if there be a true and ſincere part of the Catholick-Church in that place, and where I am only occaſionally, there I can only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate occaſionally alſo.</p>
                        <p>But to meet with the diſtempers of this Age, and to remove thoſe Apologies ſome Men make for their Schiſm, it is neceſſary to make this a queſtion. For in this divided ſtate of the Church, there are a great many among us, who think, they cannot maintain conſtant Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as conſtant and fixt Members, who yet upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions think, they may Communicate with us in all parts of Worſhip, and Actually do ſo.</p>
                        <p>Now when theſe Men, who are fixt Members, as they call it, of Separate Churches, think fit ſometimes to Communicate in all parts of Worſhip with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we charitably ſuppoſe, that Men, who pretend to ſo much tenderneſs of Conſcience, and care of their Souls, will do nothing, not ſo much as once,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:48"/> which they believe, or ſuſpect, to be ſinful, at the time, when they do it; and therefore we conclude, that thoſe, who Communicate occaſionally with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do thereby declare, that they believe, there is nothing ſinful in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and we thank them for this good opinion they expreſs of our Church, and earneſtly deſire to know, how they can juſtifie their ordinary Separation from ſuch a Church, as requires no ſinful terms of Communion.</p>
                        <p>If any thing leſs than ſinful terms of Communion can juſtifie a Separation, then there can be no end of Separations and Catholick-Communion is an Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Impracticable notion, that is, the Church of Chriſt neither is one Body, nor ever can be. For if Men are not bound to Communicate with a Church, which obſerves our Saviours Inſttutions, without any ſuch corrupt mixtures, as make its Communion ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then there is no bounds to be ſet to the Fancies of Men, but they may new model Churches, and divide and ſubdivide without any end.</p>
                        <p>Is that a ſound and Orthodox part of the Catholick-Church, which has nothing ſinful in its Communion? If it be not, Pray what is it, that makes any Church Sound and Orthodox? If it be, upon what account is it Lawful, to Separate from a Sound and Orthodox Church? And may we not by the ſame reaſon Separate from the whole Catholick Church, as from any Sound part of it? Nay does not that Man Separate from the whole Catholick Church, who Separates from any Sound part of it? For the Communion of the Church is but one, and he, that divides and breaks this union, Separates himſelf from the whole Body.</p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:49"/>
                        <p>Excepting the Independency of Churches (which I have proved above to be Schiſm in the very notion of it) the great Pleas for Separation from a Church, which has nothing ſinful in its Communion, are the pretence of greater Edification, and purer Ordinances. But theſe are ſuch Pleas, as muſt expoſe the Church to Eternal Schiſms, becauſe there are no certain Rules to judge of theſe matters, but the various and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fancies of Men. What they like beſt, that ſhall be moſt for their Edification, and theſe ſhall be purer Ordinances, and till Men can agree theſe matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, which they are never likely to do, till they can all agree in the ſame Diet; or in their judgment and opinion about beauty, decency, fitneſs convenience, they may and will divide without end; and if the Peace and Unity of the Church be ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a duty, it is certain, theſe Principles, which are ſo deſtructive to Peace and Unity, muſt be falſe, as to conſider theſe things particularly, but very briefly.</p>
                        <p>What purer Adminiſtrations and Ordinances would Men have, than thoſe of our Saviours own Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any Corrupt and ſinful mixtures, to ſpoil their vertue and efficacy? (as we ſuppoſe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by thoſe, who occaſionally Communicate in all parts of our Worſhip, that there is nothing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it) the purity of divine Adminiſtrations muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their agreement with the Inſtitution, that there is neither any ſuch defect or addition, as alters their Nature and deſtroys their Vertue. For the Efficacy of Goſpel Ordinances depends upon their Inſtitution, not upon particular modes of Adminiſtration, which are not expreſly Commanded in the Goſpel; and he, who deſires greater purity of Ordinances than their conformity to their Inſtitution, who thinks, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper loſe their Efficacy, unleſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:49"/> they be adminiſtred in that way, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beſt like, are guilty of groſs Superſtition, and attribute the vertue of Sacraments to the manner of their adminiſtration, not to their Divine Inſtitution.</p>
                        <p>And what Men talk of greater Edification is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as little underſtood as the other; for Edification is building up, and is applied to the Church, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Gods Houſe and Temple, and it is an odd way of building up the Temple of God, by dividing and Separating the parts of it from each other.</p>
                        <p>This one thing well conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> That <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                           </gap> Edification or Building, according to the Scripture notion of it, does always primarily refer to, or at leaſt include, Church-unity and Communion, is ſufficient to convince any Man, what an ill way it is, to ſeek for greater Edification in breaking the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church by Schiſm and Separation; and therefore I ſhall make it plainly appear, that this is the true Scripture notion of Edification; and to that end ſhall conſider the moſt material places, where this word is uſed.</p>
                        <p>Now the moſt proper ſignification of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                           <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:50"/> 
                           <hi>that knowledge puffeth up, but charity Edifieth,</hi> this Builds up the Church of Chriſt; and that not ſuch a common Charity as we have for all Mankind; but ſuch a love and Sympathy, as is peculiar to the Members of the ſame Body; and which none but Members can have for each other, and now methinks I need not prove, that Schiſm and Separation, is not for the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church; to Separate for Edification is to Pull down in ſtead of Building up.</p>
                        <p>But theſe Men do not ſeem to have any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Edification of the Church, but only to their own particular Edification, and we muſt grant, that Edification is ſometimes applied to particular Chriſtians in Scripture, according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Exhortation, <hi>Comfort your ſelves together, and Edifie one another,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>even as alſo ye do.</hi> And this Edifying one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion ſignifies our promoting each others growth and progreſs in all Chriſtian Graces and vertues: and ſo the Building and Edification of the Church, ſignifies the growth and improvement of the Church in all Spiritual Wiſdom and knowledge, and Chriſtian graces, the Edification of the Church conſiſts in the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particular Chriſtians, but then this is called Edification or Building, becauſe this growth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is in the Unity and Communion of the Church, and makes them one Spiritual Houſe and Temple. Thus the Church is called the Temple of God, and every particular Chriſtian is Gods Temple, wherein the Holy Spirit dwells, and yet God has but one Temple, and the Holy Spirit dwells only in the Church of Chriſt; but particular Chriſtians are Gods Temple, and the Holy Spirit dwells in them, as liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Members of the Chriſtian Church; and thus by the ſame reaſon, the Church is Edified and Built up, as it grows into a Spiritual Houſe and Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:51"/> by a firm and cloſe Union and Communion of all its parts; and every Chriſtian is Edified, as he grows up in all Chriſtian Graces and Vertues in the Unity of the Church.</p>
                        <p>And therefore whatever extraordinary means of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication Men may fancy to themſelves in a Separation, the Apoſtle knew no Edification, but in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church; and indeed if our growth and increaſe in all Grace and Vertue, be more owing to the internal aſſiſtances of the Divine Spirit, than to the external Adminiſtrations, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>I have planted, and</hi> Apollos <hi>watered, but God gave the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 6, 7.</note> 
                           <hi>increaſe: So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that gave the increaſe:</hi> And the Divine Spirit confines his influences and operations to the Unity of the Church (as the ſame Apoſtle tells us, that there is but <hi>one Body and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>one Spirit,</hi> (which plainly ſignifies) that the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this one Spirit, are appropriated to this one Body, as the Soul is to the Body i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Animates) then it does not ſeem a very likely way for Edification to cut our ſelves off from the Unity of Chriſts Body.</p>
                        <p>3. The Third and Laſt Caſe ſtill remains, which <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe </seg>3</label> will be reſolved in a few words, according to the Principles now laid down, which is this: <hi>Whether it be Lawful to Communicate with two diſtinct and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Churches.</hi> For this is thought of late days, not only a very Innocent and Lawful thing, but the true Catholick-Spirit, and Catholick-Communion, to Communicate with Churches of all Communions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perhaps they may except the Papiſts, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. It is thought a Schiſmatical Principle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to Communicate with thoſe Churches, which withdraw Communion from us. And thus ſome, who Communicate ordinarily with the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:51"/> make no Scruple to Communicate in Prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments with Presbyterian and Independent Churches, and Presbyterians can Communicate with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and with Independents, whom formerly they charged with down-right Schiſm; and ſome think it very indifferent, whom they Communicate with, and therefore take their turns in all. But this is as contrary to all the Principles of Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as any thing can poſſibly be.</p>
                        <p>To be in Communion with the Church is to be a Member of it, and to be a Member of two Separate and Oppoſite Churches, is to be as contrary to our ſelves, as thoſe Separate Churches are to each other.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt hath but one Church, and one Body, and therefore where there are two Churches divided from each other by Separate Communions, there is a Schiſm and Rent in the Body, and whoever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with both theſe Churches, on one ſide or other, Communicates in a Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>That the Presbyterian and Independent Churches, have made an Actual Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have evidently proved already; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be Lawful (as thoſe, who can, and ordinarily do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to acknowledge) then they are Schiſmaticks, and to Communicate with them is to partake in their Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>Now if Schiſm be an Innocent thing, and the true Catholick Spirit, I have no more to ſay, but that the whole Chriſtian Church, ever ſince the Apoſtles times, has been in a very great miſtake; but if Schiſm be a very great Sin, and that which will Damn us, as ſoon as Adultery and Murder, then it muſt needs be a dangerous thing to Communicate with Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:52"/>
                        <p>The Sum of all in ſhort is this. Beſides theſe Men, who juſtifie their Separation from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by charging Her with requiring Sinful terms of Communion, (which is the only thing, that can juſtifie their Separation, if it could be proved) there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who Separate lightly and wantonly, for want of a due ſenſe of the Nature of Church-Communion, and our obligations to preſerve the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. They have no notion at all of a Church, or no notion of one Church, or know not, wherein the Unity and Communion of this Church conſiſts; and theſe Men think, it is indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they Communicate with any Church at all, or that they ſecure themſelves from Schiſm by Communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes with one Church, and ſometimes with another; that they may chooſe their Church accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own fancies, and change again, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their humor alters. But I hope, who ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders carefully, what I have now writ, and attends to thoſe paſſionate Exhortations of the Goſpel to Peace, and Unity, and Brotherly Love, which cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved but in one Communion, which is the Unity of the Body of Chriſt, and the Peace and Love of fellow Members, will not only heartily Pray to the God of Peace, to reſtore Peace and Unity to his Church, but will be careful, how he divides the Church himſelf, and will uſe his utmoſt endeavours to heal the preſent Schiſms and Diviſions of the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                        </head>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I Am very ſorry, that my Silence and Patience has been miſtaken by you for an affront and neglect; which is ſuch a provocation, as I find ſome ſort of great minds cannot bear.</p>
                        <p>But yet that you may have a little mercy, I ſhall give you a brief account of the reaſon, why you had not an Anſwer before.</p>
                        <p>I did not anſwer your firſt Letter in ſo publick a manner as you deſired, becauſe I believed your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections were ſuch, as no body was concern'd in but your ſelf, and I cannot think it decent to trouble ſo numerous an Auditory with every particular mans conceits. I did not anſwer your Second Letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the Temper and Spirit of it, I eaſily foreſaw, that it would end in a publick Quarrel; and if I muſt be in Print, I henceforth reſolve to Correct the Preſs my ſelf, and not to ſuffer any man to Print my private
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:55"/> Letters for me. But yet I called at Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s Shop, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you directed me, ſeveral times, to have Invited you to a private Conference, but could never ſee him, till I accidentally met him in the ſtreet, the ſame day I received the preſent of your Printed Letters. The reaſon why I Printed thoſe Diſcourſes, which you heard me Preach, was becauſe they were deſigned for the Preſs, before they were deſigned for the Pulpit, and before I dream't of your terrible Queries; and were Printed and Preach'd exactly by the ſame Copy, excepting the Introduction to fit them to a Text, which you know is very <hi>convenient for a Sermon.</hi> And the reaſon why I ſent you one of thoſe Tracts, when it was Printed, was becauſe I did hope you might have had underſtanding enough, upon a careful peruſal of it, when it lay before you, to have anſwered thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which you made againſt it, at the firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>And now Sir, I come to conſider the Contents of your Firſt Letter; you have made ſome Repetition of what I Diſcourſed, and a very good Repetition to be done by memory, which gives you the commendable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a diligent and attentive hearer: but when you had the Diſcourſe before you in Print, you ought not then to have depended upon your memory, but to have given me my own again in my own words and order, and with that dependance and connexion, in which the whole ſtrength of that Diſcourſe conſiſts; and to have applied your Queries diſtinctly to thoſe parts of the Diſcourſe, which they related to: Had you done this, you would either have been able to have reſolved your own Queries, or would more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually have convinc'd me of my miſtake, or at leaſt have given your Readers better ſatisfaction in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of what you ſay; but now you have onely
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:55"/> given us a heap of Queries, which it is no eaſie matter to know to what they relate.</p>
                        <p>As for your Repetitions, the Reader who deſires ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction may compare them with what I have writ, which is exactly the ſame with what I Preach'd: and as for your Queries, you know how eaſie a thing it is to ask Queſtions; however, I will endeavour to find out to what they belong, and give as plain and ſhort an Anſwer to them as I can; for I aſſure you, I am not at leaſure now to write a long Book upon this Argument, and therefore it is a great comfort to me, that there is no need of it.</p>
                        <p>After your Repetition of what you could remember, or what you thought fit to take notice of in my Sermon, you give us a very miſtaken Summary of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To ſum up</hi> (ſay you) <hi>what I take to be the force of all</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Apoſtles and their Succeſſors were by our Saviour invested with a power of receiving Members into his Church upon his Terms, and with ſuch Rites as they ſhould think fit; and they who are not ſo received into the Church, have no right to any of the bleſſings promis'd to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This Power is by an uninterrupted Succeſſion, derived upon the Governours of our National Church, wherefore all others, that pretend to the exerciſe of this Power within this Nation, are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers; and all the Laity Baptized by their Paſtors, not being duly admitted into any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, are ſo far from being Members of Chriſt's Body, that they are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers and Traitors to that Power, which is derived from him in a right line.</hi> Durus hic Sermo.</p>
                        <p>Had you not told the World in your Title-Page, that you are a Lay-man, to make your Triumph over a poor undone Dr. of Divinity the more glorious, I ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:56"/> have taken you to be the Founder of ſome new Sect of Conjectural Divines; and truly you are ſo happy in your gueſſes, that I believe few men will ever be able to out-do you in this Art. For there is not one word of all this matter in that Diſcourſe, which you pretend to ſum up, as it was delivered by me. That to which you ſeem to refer, is contained in one ſhort Paragraph, which I ſhall Tranſcribe, and leave the moſt fanciful Reader to try his skill to ſum it up as you have done. Having before aſſerted, that <hi>God onely can Conſtitute a Church,</hi> I added, <hi>And I think it is as plain, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reſolut. of Caſes,</hi> p. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>viſible way God has of Forming a Church (for I do not now ſpeak of the Inviſible Operations of the Divine Spirit) is by granting a Church-Covenant, which is the Divine Charter whereon the Church is Founded, and inveſting ſome perſons with Power and Authority to receive others into this Convenant, according to the terms and conditions of the Covenant, and by ſuch Covenant-Rites, and Forms of Admiſſion, as he is pleaſed to Inſtitute; which under the Goſpel is Baptiſm, as under the Law it was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I was diſcourſing of Gods viſible way of Forming a Church, which I aſſerted to be by granting a Church-Covenant, which is that Divine Charter on which the Church is Founded; but then leſt any one ſhould queſtion, how men are admitted into this Covenant, I added, that God had inveſted ſome Perſons with Power and Authority to receive others into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by Baptiſm; and by receiving them into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they make them Members of that Church, which is Founded on this Covenant.</p>
                        <p>Now what of all this will any ſober Diſſenter deny? Here is no diſpute, who is inveſted with this Power, what form of Church-Government Chriſt Inſtituted, whether Epiſcopal or Presbyterian; here is no Diſpute
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:56"/> about the validity of Orders, or Succeſſion, or in what caſes Baptiſm may be valid, which is not Adminiſtred by a valid Authority; This did not concern my preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which proceeds upon a quite different Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, <hi>viz.</hi> the neceſſity of Communion with the <hi>one</hi> Church and Body of Chriſt, for all thoſe who are, or would be owned to be Chriſtians, or Members of Chriſts Body. I make no inquiry, by whom they have been Baptized, or whether they were rightly Baptized or not; but taking all theſe things for granted, I inquire whether Baptiſm do not make us Church-Members; whether it makes us Members of a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or Univerſal Church; whether a Church-Member be not bound to Communion with the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; whether he that ſeparates from any ſound part of the Catholick Church, be not a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick from the whole Church; whether we be not bound to maintain conſtant Communion with that particular Church, in which we live, and with which we can, when we pleaſe, Communicate occaſionally; whether it be conſiſtent with Catholick Communion, to communicate with two Churches, which are in a ſtate of Separation from each other: if you have any thing to ſay to theſe matters, you ſhall have a fair hearing; but all your Queries, which proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a miſtaken Hypotheſis of your own, do not concern me; and yet to oblige you, if it be poſſible, I ſhall briefly conſider them.</p>
                        <p>1. Your firſt Query is, <hi>Whether a Pious Diſſenter ſuppoſed to be received into the Church by ſuch as he believes to be fully inveſted with ſufficient Power, is in as bad a condition as a Moral Heathen, or in a worſe than a Papiſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:57"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Catholick Church has been ſo indulgent to Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, as to determine againſt the Neceſſity of Rebaptization, if they have been once, though irregularly baptized. This you may find a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of, in the Vindication of the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> p. 22. &amp;c. But the queſtion is, whether if they continue Schiſmaticks, whatever their other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Piety be, their Condition be not as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as the Condition of Moral Heathens and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Whether the Submiſſion to the Power and Cenſures of this Church, (which all muſt own to be a ſound Church) be part of the Divine Covenant, which <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nites the Members of the Catholick Church to God and to each other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a captious queſtion, which muſt be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered. A general Submiſſion and Obedience to the Authority and Cenſures of the Church, though it cannot properly be called a part of that Divine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whereon the Church is founded, which primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects the promiſe of Salvation by Chriſt through Faith in his Bloud; yet it is a neceſſary Church-Duty, and Eſſential to Church-Communion, and ſo may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a part of the Covenant, if by the Covenant we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all thoſe Duties which are required of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Chriſtians, and Members of the Church, by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine poſitive Law, as Obedience to Church-Governours is.</p>
                        <p>But then Obedience to the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not an univerſal Duty incumbent on all Chriſtians, but onely on thoſe, which are, or ought to live, in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this particular Church: for the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Church-Authoritie and Juriſdiction is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within certain limits, as of neceſſitie it muſt be; and though all <hi>Orthodox</hi> Churches muſt live in Communion with each other, yet no particular Church can pretend
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:57"/> to any original Authority over another Church, or the Members of it, as is the conſtant Doctrine of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, in oppoſition to the Uſurpations of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I perceive Sir you know no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Authority and Power, and the Communion of the Church.</p>
                        <p>But you add, <hi>If it be, then as he who is not admitted into this Church, is no Member of the Catholick, and has no right to the benefits of being a Member of Chriſts Body: ſo is it with every one, who is excluded by Church-Cenſures, though excommunicated for a ſlight contempt or neglect, nay, for a wrongful cauſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Truly Sir, I know not how any man is admitted into the Church of <hi>England,</hi> any otherwiſe than as he is admitted into the whole Catholick Church, <hi>viz,</hi> by Baptiſm, which does not make us Members of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, but of the Univerſal Church, which Obliges us to Communicate with that part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church wherein we live; and whoever lives in <hi>England,</hi> and renounces Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a Schiſmatick from the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
                        <p>And whoever is Excommunicated from one ſound part of the Catholick Church, is Excommunicated from the whole. But then, there is this difference between Excommunication and Schiſm; the firſt is a Judicial Sentence, the ſecond is a Mans own Choice; the firſt is not valid unleſs it be inflicted for a juſt cauſe, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is always valid, and does in its own nature cut Men off from all Communion with Chriſts Body. I ſay in its own Nature, for I will not pretend to determine the final States of Men, for I know not what gracious allowances God will make for ſome Schiſmaticks, no more than I do what favour he may allow to other Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:58"/>
                        <p>But you proceed. <hi>If it be no part of the Divine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then a Man that lives here may be a true Member of the Catholick Church, though he is not in Communion with this Sound Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is another Horn of your formidable Dilemma. If Obedience to the Authoritie and Cenſures of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular National Church of <hi>England</hi> is no part of the Divine Covenant, then thoſe Baptized Chriſtians, who live in <hi>England,</hi> are not bound to the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and may be Catholick Chriſtians for all that. As if becauſe the Subjects of <hi>Spain</hi> are not bound to obey the King of <hi>England,</hi> therefore Engliſh Men are not bound to obey him neither, but may be very good Subjects for all that.</p>
                        <p>We are bound by the Divine Law, to live in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with all true Catholick Churches, and to obey the Governours of the Church wherein we live; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though Obedience to the Church of <hi>England</hi> be not a Law to all the World, yet it is a Law to all Engliſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians inhabiting in this Church. But your way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, as if a Man ſhould ſay, It is a Divine Law to obey Civil Magiſtrates, but there is no Divine Law that all the World ſhould obey the King of <hi>England, France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> therefore French or Engliſh Subjects are not bound to obey their own Prince. Oh what comfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this to ſome Men!</p>
                        <p>You proceed. <hi>But you will ſay (which I think is not much to the queſtion) that he ought to Communicate, if Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion may be had.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yes, I do ſay this; and I believe by this time you ſee, or at leaſt others will ſee, that it is much to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But then Query, whether the Diſſenters may not reply, that they are ready to Communicate, if the Communion be not clog'd with ſome things, which are no part of the Divine Covenant.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>Yes, they may replie ſo if they pleaſe, or <hi>Anonymus</hi> for them; but whoever does it, the replie is very weak and impertinent. It is weak, becauſe Obedience to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in all lawful things, is in a large notion part of the Divine Covenant: And it is very impertinent, becauſe the Suppoſition of Communicating, <hi>where Communion may be had,</hi> ſuperſedes that Query. For Communion cannot be had, where there are any ſinful Terms of Communion: and though I aſſert, that the Church muſt be founded on a Divine Covenant, I never ſaid, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be enjoyned by the Church, but what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in that Covenant. A Corporation, which is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a Royal Charter, you know, may have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to make By-Laws, which ſhall oblige all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, and ſo are Terms of Communion with it; and yet it is the Charter, not theſe By-Laws, whereon the Corporation is founded. I was not concerned to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Terms of Communion, (that is, and will be done by other hands) but, ſuppoſing nothing Sinful in our Communion, whether all Chriſtians, that live in this Church, are not bound to live in Communion with it.</p>

                           <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Your next Query concerns the Derivation of Church-Power from Chriſt himſelf, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Derivation from other Church-Governours; which does not at all concern my Doctrine of Church-Communion; for whether it be ſo or ſo, ſtill we are bound to maintain Communion with all ſound parts of the Catholick Church; ſo Church-Authoritie be Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt any way, it is well enough, but then we muſt be ſure that it is ſo: and if Chriſt have appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ordinarie way for this, but by the hands of Men, who received their Authoritie immediately from himſelf, I know not who can appoint any other way.</p>

                        <p>But may not a Lay-man preach the Goſpel and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Church in a Heathen Country, where there is none of the Clergy to do it? I ſuppoſe he may; and if you pleaſe to conſult the Vindication of the Defence of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> Unreaſonableneſs of Separation, <hi>p.</hi> 331, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you will finde this caſe largely deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p>But it ſeems it doth not ſatisfie you, that this be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed onely in caſe of Neceſſity, for then up ſtart two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queries.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Whether this will not put the being of our Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very hazardous iſſue, and oblige your ſelf to prove, that it was a true Church before the Reformation?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is no hazard at all, for the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> was certainly a true, though a corrupt, Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is at this day. A true Church is that which has every thing Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the being of a Church, though mixt with ſuch other Corruptions, as make its Communion dangerous and ſinful, as a Diſeaſed Man is a true Man; and remove theſe Corruptions, and then it is not onely a true, but a ſound Church, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> is at this day. And if you will not allow this, I doubt, Sir, all private Chriſtians will be at as great a loſs for their Baptiſm, as the Church will be for Orders. But the caſe of a True <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vindicat.</hi> p. 64. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> and Sound and Catholick Church, if you pleaſe, you may ſee Stated in the ſame Book to which I referred you before.</p>
                        <p>And thus your ſecond Query is anſwered, that though this Church was Antichriſtian before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yet there was not the ſame Neceſſity for private Chriſtians to uſurp the Miniſterial Office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a regular Authoritie, as there is for a Lay-man in a Heathen Nation, becauſe an Antichriſtian, that is, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:59"/> moſt corrupt Church, retains the Power of Orders, as well as of Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>As for that Independent Principle, that Chriſt has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a Power in the Church to ordain her own Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, you may ſee it Examined in the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nr. of Sep.</hi> p. 306, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But what now is all this to me? I don't charge our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters with Schiſm from the Invalidity of their Orders, but for their cauſeleſs and ſinful Separation. Let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they have no need of any Orders, or that ſuch Orders as they have are good, or that they had Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Orders, and were Governed by Biſhops of their own, as the Donatiſts were, yet they would be never the leſs Schiſmaticks for that, while they ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from each other. If Orders be neceſſary, and they have no Orders, then they are no Churches at all; if they have true Orders, and are true Churches, but yet divide Chriſtian Communion by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from any Sound part of the Chriſtian Church, they are Schiſmaticks.</p>
                        <p>4. Q <hi>Whether from the Suppoſition, that there ought to be but one Church-Covenant throughout the Catholick Church, that there cannot be one true Church within another, and that the Nature of Catholick-Communion is ſuch, that one ought to be ready to Communicate with any Sound Church, from which one is not hindred by reaſon of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Place? it do's not follow.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Fair and Softly! let us firſt conſider the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, before we conſider what follows from them; for you have ſo miſ-repreſented, ſo curtailed theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo mixt and blended things of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is neceſſarie to reſtore them to their true Senſe and proper Place again, before we can tell what follows.</p>
                        <p>I aſſerted, that the Chriſtian Church is founded upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:60"/> a Divine Covenant, and ſince God hath made but one Covenant with mankind in Chriſt Jeſus, therefore there can be but one Chriſtian Church throughout the World, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reſol. of Caſes,</hi> p. 8.</note> founded on this one Covenant.</p>
                        <p>Having explained the general notion of <hi>Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which ſignifies no more than Church-Fellowſhip and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>Society, that to be in Communion with the Church is to be a Member of the Church,</hi> I came to enquire, what made a Separate Church. <hi>For if there be but one Church and one Communion, of which all true Chriſtians and Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>are or ought to be Members, then thoſe Churches, which are not Members of each other, are Separate Churches.</hi> And for a fuller explication of this, I obſerved ſeveral <note place="margin">p. 20.</note> things.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>That there muſt be but one Church in one Place. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other Rule of Catholick-Communion, but to Communicate in all Religious Offices, and all Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcipline, with thoſe Chriſtians with whom they live. For to Renounce the Ordinary Communion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or true Chriſtian Church, is to divide the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion of the Church; and to withdraw our ſelves from Ordinary Communion with the Church in which we live, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 21.</note> 
                           <hi>diſtinct and ſeparate Societies for Worſhip, is to Renounce their Communion, and when there is not a neceſſary cauſe for it, is a Schiſmatical Separation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And a little after I added, <hi>If all Chriſtians are Members of the one Body of Christ, nothing can justifie the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſtians into ſeveral Churches, but onely ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place, as makes it neceſſary and expedient to put them under the Conduct and Government of ſeveral Biſhops, for the greater Edification of the Church in the more eaſie and regular Administration of Diſcipline. And therefore nothing can justifie the gathering a Church out of a Church, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Neighbour Christians into distinct Communions.</hi> Now then let us conſider what follows.</p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:60"/>
                        <p>1. You ſay, <hi>either that the French Proteſtants have no Church here, but are Schiſmaticks in not Communicating with ours; Or that ours is guilty of Schiſm, in making the Terms of Communion ſo ſtreight, that it is not the Duty of of every one (though a licenſed Stranger) to Communicate with this Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> If any Foreign Church among us, which by Royal Favour is allowed the Obſervation of their own Diſcipline and Rules of Worſhip, Renounce Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or Communicate with our Separatiſts, ſhe is Schiſmatical her ſelf; as the Proteſtant Churches in <hi>France, Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> would be, ſhould they do the like. But if there be any reaſon to allow thoſe Foreigners, which are among us, to Form and Model their Congregations according to the Rules of their own Churches to which they original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong, this is no more a Schiſm, than there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Proteſtant Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which own each others Communion.</p>
                        <p>A bare Variety of Rites and Ceremonies makes no Schiſm between Churches; our Church pretends not to give Laws to other Churches, in ſuch matters, but leaves them to their Liberty, as ſhe takes her own: and why an Eccleſiaſtical Colony may not for great reaſons be Tranſplanted into another Church, as well as a Civil Colony into another Kingdom, while they live in Communion with each other, I cannot tell. It is a different thing to gather a Church out of a Church, and to Tranſplant ſome Members of one Church into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (maintaining the ſame Communion, though with ſome peculiar and different uſages) with the conſent of the Church to which they come.</p>
                        <p>The caſe of Strangers and Natives has always been accounted very different, both upon a Religious and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil account: Every particular National Church has
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:61"/> Authority over her own Members, to direct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern her own Communion, and preſcribe the Rules of Worſhip; but as ſhe does not Impoſe upon other Churches at a diſtance, ſo ſhe may allow the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Members of ſuch Foreign Churches, when they live within her Juriſdiction, without breach of Communion: for tho the Communion of the whole Chriſtian Church is but one, and all true Catholick Churches are Members of each other, yet the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juriſdiction is different; every Church challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a peculiar Authority, which it exerciſeth in its own Communion; and therefore for the Church of <hi>England</hi> to ſuffer Foreign Churches to obſerve their own Cuſtoms and Uſages, is not to allow of diſtinct and ſeparate Communions in her own Bowels, (which were Schiſmatical,) but onely to exempt ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Strangers from her particular Juriſdiction, and to leave them to the Government and Authority of the Church to which they belong.</p>
                        <p>There was no ſuch thing indeed allowed in the Primitive Church, as diſtinct Congregations of Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners under a different Rule and Government; and it were very deſirable, that all Chriſtians who have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to live in other Countries, would conform to all the innocent and laudable cuſtoms of the Church where they ſojourn, which ſeems moſt agreeable to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion; but yet diſtinct Congregations of Foreigners, who own the Communion of our Church, tho they obſerve the cuſtoms of their own, are not Schiſmatical, as the Separate Conventicles of Diſſenters are.</p>
                        <p>2. But <hi>does it not follow from the obligation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or to be ready to communicate with any true Church where diſtance does not hinder, that a Member of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is not obliged to conſtant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:61"/> 
                           <hi>with that Church, but may occaſionally communicate with the French Church, nay with Diſſenters too, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that any of their Congregations is a true Member of the Catholick Church?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a great Maſtery of Wit, to turn my own Artillery upon me. I prove the Diſſenters to be Schiſmaticks, becauſe they ſet up a Church within a Church, whereas there ought to be but one Church and one Communion in one place, every Chriſtian being bound to Communicate with the ſound part of the Catholick Church in the place wherein he lives; for according to the Laws of Catholick Communion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diſtance of place can ſuſpend our obligation to actual Communion; Hence you conclude, that we muſt Communicate with Schiſmaticks, if there be any among us, or ſo near to us, that diſtance does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Communion. But you ſhould conſider, that our obligation to Catholick Communion does equally oblige us to renounce the Communion of Schiſmaticks whether at home or abroad; and tho we ſhould allow them to be true Churches, yet if Schiſmatical, they are not Catholick Churches, and therefore not the objects of Catholick-Communion.</p>
                        <p>But however, we may lawfully Communicate with the French Church that is among us, as occaſion ſerves. Yes, no doubt we may, becauſe they are in Communion with us. But then follows the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſequence, <hi>that a Member of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is not bound to a conſtant Communion with her.</hi> I pray, why ſo? every Member, as a Member, is in conſtant Communion; for to be in Communion with <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reſol. of Caſes,</hi> p. 10.</note> a Church, is to be a Member of it, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large: but then Church-Communion does not primarily reſpect a Particular but the Univerſal <note place="margin">p. 13.</note> Church, and therefore it is no interruption of our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:62"/> Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate actually with any Church, which is in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her: for as all Chriſtians, who are neither Hereticks nor Schiſmaticks, are Members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, ſo they are in Communion with the Catholick Church, and every ſound part of it. The State of Communion is conſtant with the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, the acts of Communion are performed ſometimes in one part of it, ſometimes in another, as our preſence, abode, or occaſions, require; and thus it is poſſible actually to Communicate with the French Church, either in <hi>England</hi> or out of <hi>England,</hi> without interrupting our Communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for the Communion is one and the ſame in all Chriſtian Churches, which are in Communion with each other, though they may obſerve different Rites and Modes of Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>And this I ſuppoſe is a Sufficient anſwer to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther untoward conſequence, that if the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may occaſionally Communicate with the French Church, <hi>then Conſtant Communion is not always a Duty, where occaſional Communion is lawful;</hi> I ſuppoſe, becauſe we are not bound to a conſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual or preſential Communion with the French Church, though we may occaſionally Communicate with it.</p>
                        <p>But certainly, Sir, Had you ever conſidered, what I diſcourſt about conſtant and occaſional Communion, you would not have made ſuch an Objection as this: For this is a Modern diſtinction, which has no ſence at the bottom, as I plainly ſhewed. But however, by conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, our Diſſenters underſtand the performing the Acts of Communion, always or ordinarily in the ſame Church; and by occaſional Communion, performing the Acts of Communion ſometimes, or as occaſion ſerves, in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:62"/> another Church; now with reſpect to this Notion of conſtant or occaſional Communion, as it ſignifies the conſtant and ordinary, or the Occaſional Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, muſt that queſtion be underſtood, <hi>whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Communion he a Duty, where Occaſional Communion is Lawful;</hi> the meaning of which queſtion is this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when other reaſons and circumſtances determine my Perſonal Communion Ordinarily to one Church, it be not my Duty to Communicate ordinarily with that Church, if I can lawfully Communicate ſometimes with it: and there being no other reaſon to juſtifie non-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any Church with which I am bound for other reaſons Ordinarily to Communicate, but onely Sinful Terms of Communion, and there being no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for ſuch a Pretence, where occaſional Communion is acknowledged Lawful, (for Sinful Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion make occaſional as well as conſtant Acts of Communion Sinful) I hence conclude, that it is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duty to Communicate conſtantly or ordinarily with that Church in which I live, if it be Lawful to Communicate occaſionally, or ſometimes, with it.</p>
                        <p>But if any Man will be ſo perverſe as to underſtand this Queſtion, as you now do, not of the Communion of a Church which for other reaſons we are bound to Communicate Ordinarily with, but of any Church with which I may Lawfully Communicate as occaſion ſerves, it makes it an abſurd and ſenſeleſs Propoſition, to ſay, that conſtant Communion (by that meaning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and perſonal Communion) is always a Duty, where occaſional Communion is lawful. For at this rate, if occaſional Communion with the Proteſtant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>France, Geneva, Holland, Germany,</hi> be Lawful, it becomes a neceſſary Duty for me to Communicate always perſonally and preſentionally with all theſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:63"/> Churches at the ſame time, which no man can do, who can be preſent but in one place at a time. But yet thus far the Propoſition holds univerſally true, that whatever Church I can occaſionally Communicate with without Sin, I am alſo bound to Communicate conſtantly with, whenever ſuch reaſons, as are neceſſarie to determine my Communion to a particular Church, make it my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to do ſo. And no man in his Wits ever underſtood this Queſtion in any other ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>But this you think cannot be my meaning; For <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to me, no Man is obliged to be a Member of one Sound Church more than another, provided the diſtance is not ſo great, but that he may Communicate with both.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is wonderful to me, Sir, how you ſhould come to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ſo many abſurd Propoſitions upon me; and I would deſire of you for the future, if you have no regard to your own Reputation, yet upon Principles of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honeſty, not to write ſo haſtily, but to take ſome time to underſtand a Book, before you undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it.</p>
                        <p>Where do I ſay, <hi>that no man is Obliged to be a Member of one Sound Church more than of another?</hi> I aſſert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that no Baptized Chriſtian is a Member of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, conſidered meerly as particular, but is a Member of the univerſal Church, and of all ſound Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Churches, as parts of the Univerſal Church. This puts him into a State of Communion with the whole Church, without which he cannot be properly ſaid to perform any Act of Church-Communion, though he ſhould join in all the Acts and Offices of Chriſtian worſhip: But is there no difference between being a Member of the Univerſal Church, and of all particular Churches, which are Parts and Members of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, and <hi>not to be Obliged to be a Member of one Sound Church more than of another?</hi> The firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:63"/> that every Chriſtian, whatever particular Church he actually Communicates in, is a Member of the whole Chriſtian Church, and of all particular Sound Churches; the ſecond ſuppoſes the quite contrary, that Chriſtians are ſo Members of one Church, as they are not of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that conſtant Communion in a particular Church confines their Church-Memberſhip to that particular Church in which they Communicate.</p>
                        <p>So that the queſtion is not, what Church I muſt be a Member of; for every Chriſtian is a Member of the whole Church, not meerly of this or that particular Church; but what particular Church I muſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in: now our Obligation to Communicate in a certain particular Church, reſults from the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live; The Church in which we were Born and Baptized, and have our Ordinary abode and Reſidence, the Church which is incorporated into the State of which we are Natural Subjects, if it be a true and ſound Chriſtian Church, Challenges our Communion and Obedience.</p>
                        <p>Now in the ſame place, there never can be any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition between two Churches, becauſe there muſt be but one Church in the ſame place, and therefore there can be no diſpute in what Church we muſt conſtantly Communicate, which muſt be the Church in which we live.</p>
                        <p>But is there not a <hi>French,</hi> and a <hi>Dutch,</hi> as well as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> and ſince diſtance of place does not hinder, may we not chooſe, which of theſe we will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Communicate with?</p>
                        <p>I anſwer no, we have onely the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Church is in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church is in <hi>Holland,</hi> though there is a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregation allowed in <hi>London.</hi> Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations belong to their own Original Churches,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:64"/> and are under their Government and Cenſures; but there is no Church-Power and Authority in <hi>England,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore though we may occaſionally Communicate with the <hi>French</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, our Obligation to conſtant Communion is with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which alone has Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juriſdiction in <hi>England</hi> to require our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Obedience: one particular Church is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from another not by a diſtinct and ſeparate Communion, which is Schiſmatical, but by diſtinct Power and Juriſdiction; and that Church within whoſe Juriſdiction we live, can onely Challenge our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and I ſuppoſe no Man will ſay, that in this ſence, we live in the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Church, becauſe there is a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Church allowed among us.</p>
                        <p>5. Your next Query is, <hi>Whether a true Chriſtian, though not viſibly admitted into Church-Communion, where he wants the Means, has not a virtual Baptiſm in the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, according to</hi> 1. Peter, 2. 21.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> What this concerns me, I cannot tell. I ſpeak onely of the Neceſſity of Viſible Communion in Viſible Members, you put a queſtion, whether the want of Viſible Admiſſion by Baptiſm, when it can't be had, may not be ſupplied with the anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God. I hope in ſome caſes it may, though I do not hope this from what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaies, who onely ſpeaks of that Anſwer of a good Conſcience, which is made at Baptiſm, not of that, which is made without it. But what God will accept of in this caſe, is not my buſineſs to determie; unbaptized Perſons are no Viſible Members of the Church, and therefore not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Viſible Communion, and therefore not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at all in this diſpute.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Query, Why a profeſt Atheiſt, who has been Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:64"/> 
                           <hi>and out of Secular Intereſt continues a Communicant with this Church, is more a Member of the Catholick Church than ſuch as are above deſcribed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Neither Atheiſts nor Schiſmaticks are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church. But this is a vile inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation againſt the Governours and Government of our Church, as if profeſt Atheiſts were admitted to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Though poſſibly there may be ſome Atheiſts, yet I never met yet with one, who would profeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Atheiſt. If I ſhould, I aſſure you, I would not admit him to Communion, and I hope there is no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would; and I am ſure, no Man, who had any kindneſs for the Church, with which he pretends to hold Communion, would ask ſuch a queſtion.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Query. Whether as the Catholick Church is compared to a Body of Men incorporated by one Charter ſhould upon ſuppoſition of a poſſibility of the forfeiture of the Charter to the whole Body, by the Miſcarriages of any of the Officers, does it likewiſe follow that the Miſcarriages of any of the Officers, or the Church Repreſentative, as I remember Biſhop</hi> Sanderſon <hi>calls the Clergy, may forfeit the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges given by Chriſt to his Church, or at leaſt may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend them? As ſuppoſe a Proteſtant Clergy taking their Power to be as large as the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>claim'd, ſhould deny the Laity the Sacraments, as the Popiſh did in</hi> Venice, <hi>and here in King</hi> Johns <hi>time, during the Interdicts,</hi> quid inde operatur?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Juſt as much as this Query does the reaſon of which I cannot eaſily gueſs. I aſſerted indeed, that as there is but one Covenant on which the Church is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo there can be but one Church to which this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant belongs; and therefore thoſe, who divide and ſeparate themſelves from this one Body of Chriſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reſol. of Caſes,</hi> p. 8. &amp;c.</note> their right to this Covenant, which is made onely
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:65"/> with the one Body of Chriſt; which I illuſtrated by the inſtance of a Charter granted to a particular Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which no Man had any intereſt in, who divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf from that Corporation to which this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was granted: but what is this to forfeiting a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Miſcarriages of Officers? I doubt Sir, your Head has been Warmed with Quo Warranto's, which ſo affect your Fancy, that you can Dream of nothing elſe.</p>
                        <p>I was almoſt afraid, when your hand was in, I ſhould never have ſeen an end of theſe Queſtions; and I know no more reaſon, why you ſo ſoon left off asking Queſtions, than why you askt any at all; for I would undertake to ask five hundred more, as pertinent to the buſineſs as moſt of theſe. You have not indeed done yet, but have a reſerve of particular Queries; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Queries are the moſt formidable things, becauſe it is harder to find what they relate to, than how to Anſwer them.</p>
                        <p>You have three ſets of Queries relating to three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propoſitions, beſides a parting blow of four Queries relating to my Text.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Propoſition you are pleaſed to queſtion me about is this, <hi>That our Saviour made the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors Governours of his Church, with promiſe to be with them to the end of the World.</hi> Which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to prove, that when the Church is called <hi>the Body of Chriſt,</hi> it does not ſignifie a confuſed multitude of Chriſtians, but a regular Society under Order and Government.</p>
                        <p>Now Sir, is this true or falſe? if it be falſe, then the Church is not a governed Society, is not a Body, but a confuſed heap and multitude of Independent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, which is ſomewhat worſe than Independent Churches. If it be true, why do you ask all theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:65"/> Queſtions, unleſs you have a mind to confute our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and burleſque his Inſtitutions: but ſince I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to anſwer queſtions, I will briefly conſider them.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Whether our Saviours promiſe of Divine Aſſiſtance, did not extend to all the Members of the Church, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man in his reſpective ſtation and capacity, as well as the Apoſtles, as Church-Governours? For which you may compare St.</hi> John <hi>with St.</hi> Matthew.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt but there are promiſes, which relate to the whole Church, and promiſes which belong to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chriſtians, as well as promiſes which relate peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly to the Apoſtles and Governours of the Church, in the exerciſe of their Miniſterial Office and Authority: but what then? Chriſt is with his Church, with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, with particular Chriſtians, to the end of the World, but in a different manner, and to different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and yet that promiſe there is peculiarly made to the Apoſtles, including their Succeſſors alſo; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves were not to continue here to the end of the World, but an Apoſtolical Miniſtry was.</p>
                        <p>2. Therefore Query, <hi>Whether it ſignifies any thing to ſay there is no promiſe to particular Churches, provided there be to particular Perſons, ſuch as are in charity with all Men, and are ready to communicate with any Church which requires no more of them, than what they conceive to be their duty; according to the Divine Covenant?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſeems to me to be a harder Query, what this Query means; or how it concerns that Authority, which our Saviour has given to his Apoſtles for the Government of the Church; to which this Query re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. I aſſerted indeed, that Chriſt hath made no Covenant with any particular, but onely with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church, which includes particulars as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it; nor has he made any promiſe to particular Perſons, but as Members of the Church, and in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:66"/> with it, when it may be had upon lawful terms. Whoever breaks the Communion of the Church without neceſſary reaſon, tho he may in other things be a very good natur'd man, yet he has not true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity, which unites all the Members of the ſame Body in one Communion; and tho the Church may preſcribe Rules of Worſhip, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Divine Covenant, this will not juſtifie a Separation, if ſhe commands nothing which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid; for the very Authority Chriſt has committed to his Miniſters, requires our obedience to them in things lawful; and if Men will adhere to their own private Fancies in oppoſition to Church-Authority, they are guilty of Schiſm, and had beſt conſider, whether ſuch pride and opinionativeneſs will be allowed for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Whether if the promiſe you mention be confined to the Apoſtles, as Church-Governours, it will not exclude the Civil Power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> There are peculiar promiſes made to Church-Governours, and to Civil Magiſtrates; their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power is very diſtinct, but very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>What was the extent of the promiſe, whether it was to ſecure the whole Church, that its Governours ſhould never impoſe unlawful Terms of Communion, or that there never be a defection of all the Members of the Catholick Church, but that there ſhould always be ſome true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> The promiſe is, that Chriſt will be with them in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry, and Exerciſe of their Power, and this is all I know of the matter; our Saviour gave them Authority to Govern the Church, and this was to laſt to the end of the World, as long as there is any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:66"/> Church on Earth, which is all I cited it for, and ſo much it certainly proves.</p>
                        <p>The Second Propoſition: you raiſe Queries on, is this. <hi>'Tis abſurd to gather a Church out of a Church of Baptized Chriſtians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This I do indeed aſſert, that ſince the Church is founded on a Divine Covenant, and to be in Covenant with God, and to be Members of his Church, is the ſame thing; therefore Baptiſm whereby we are received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with God, makes us Members of the Church alſo; and this makes it very abſurd, to gather a Church out of Churches of Baptized Chriſtians, which ſuppoſes that they were not a Church before: inſtead of conſidering the reaſon, whereon this is founded, as every honeſt Writer ſhould do, you onely put a perverſe Comment on it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>By which</hi> (ſay you) <hi>I ſuppoſe you mean, That Men ought not to Separate from ſuch, and live in a diſtinct Church-Communion from any Church of Baptized Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; which I conceive needs explaining.</hi> But if this were true, it were plain enough, but the fault is, that it is not true; for we may Separate from any Church of Baptized Chriſtians, if their Communion be Sinful; which juſtifies a Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and anſwers your two firſt Queries.</p>
                        <p>But indeed the Propoſition, as aſſerted by me, does not ſo much as concern a Separation from a Church, let the cauſe be what it will, juſt or unjuſt. For the Independents, who are the Men for gathering Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, do not own, that they Separate from any Church, but that they form themſelves into a Church-State, which they had not before, and which no Chriſtians, according to their Principle, have, who are not Members of Independent Churches. Baptiſm, they acknowledge, makes Men Chriſtians at large, but not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:67"/> Church-Members, which I ſhewed muſt needs be very abſurd, if the Church be a Body and Society of Men founded on a Divine Covenant; for then Baptiſm, which admits us into Covenant with God, makes us Members of the Church; and they may as well rebaptize Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as form them into new Church-Societies.</p>
                        <p>This I ſuppoſe may ſatisfie you, how impertinent all your Queries are under this head.</p>
                        <p>Your two firſt concern the Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was not made upon Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles, becauſe they were no Church, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were a corrupt Church.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Whether every Biſhoprick in England be not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches within the National. Anſ.</hi> Every Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick is a diſtinct Epiſcopal Church, and the Union of them in one National Communion, makes them not ſo many Churches, within a National, but one National Church; which you may ſee explained at large in the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nr.</hi> of Separation.</p>
                        <p>4. And therefore Independent and Presbyterian Churches are indeed within the National (Churches within a Church, which is Schiſmatical) but not one National Church, as Biſhopricks are.</p>
                        <p>5. And therefore tho we ſhould allow them to have the External Form and all the Eſſentials of a Church (which is a very liberal grant) yet they are not in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion, becauſe they are Schiſmaticks.</p>
                        <p>6. And this is all I am to account for, that they are not in Viſible Communion with that one Church and Body of Chriſt to which the promiſes are made. But what allowances Chriſt will make for the miſtakes of honeſt well-meaning Men, who divide the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, I cannot determine. I can hope as Charitably, as any Man, but I dare not be ſo Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, as to make Church-Communion an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:67"/> thing, which is the great Bond of Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                        <p>3dly. You take occaſion for your next Queries, from what I ſay of the Independent Church-Covenant; you ſay, I <hi>ſuppoſe, that the Independents exclude themſelves from Catholick Communion, by requiring of their Members a new contract, no part of the Baptiſmal vow.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I prove indeed from their placing a Church-State in a particular explicite Covenant between Paſtor and People, that they ſeparate themſelves from the whole Body of Chriſtians; for no other Chriſtians, which are not in Covenant with them, are Members of their Church, nor can they be Members of any other Church. And I proved that thoſe are Separate Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reſol. of Caſes.</hi> p. 10. 32.</note> which are not Members of each other, and do not own each others Members for their own. For the Notion of Church-Communion conſiſts in Church-Memberſhip, and therefore no Man is in Communion with that Church of which he is no Member; and if no Man can be a Member of a Church, but by ſuch an explicite Independent Covenant, then he is a Member of no Church but that, with which he is in Covenant, and conſequently is in Communion with no Church, but that particular Independent Congregation of which he is a Member by a particular Covenant. And if thoſe be Schiſmaticks and Schiſmatical Churches, which are not in Communion with each other, then all Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents muſt be Schiſmaticks, for they are in Communion with none, but their own Independent Congregations. Let us now hear your Queries.</p>
                        <p>Q. 1. <hi>Whether any Obſtacle to Catholick Communion brought in by Men, may not be a means of depriving Men of it, as well as Covenant or Contract?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes it may, but with this Material difference: Other things hinder Communion as Sinful Terms of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:68"/> Communion, this Independent Covenant in its own Nature Shuts up, Encloſes, and breaks Chriſtian Communion into as many Separate Churches and Communions, as there are Independent Congregations. Sinful Terms of Communion are a juſt cauſe of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; an Independent Church-Covenant is a State of Separation in its own Nature. The Communion of the Church may be reſtored by removing thoſe Sinful Terms of Communion, but there can be no Catholick Unity or Communion in the Church under Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                        <p>Q. 2. <hi>If it may, which I ſuppoſe you will not deny, will you not then upon this account, make the Church you live in more guilty than the Independents? Baptiſm you own is the onely thing, which admits into the Catholick Church, but they require no new Covenant at Baptiſm,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they admit into the Church without any clog or hindrance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Pray what compariſon is there between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Independency? Whatever fault the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be charged with, as to its Rites and Ceremonies (which I will not now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with you) yet all this is capable of a Remedy; ſhe may give occaſion to Schiſm, if ſhe impoſes any unlawful and Sinful Terms of Communion, but yet the Frame and Eſſential conſtitution of the Church is not Schiſmatical; but Independency is Schiſm in the very notion of it, and an Independent Conventicle is never capable of becoming a Member of the Catholick Church.</p>
                        <p>But you ſay, <hi>I own that Baptiſm is the onely thing which admits into the Catholick Church,</hi> i. e. which makes us Members of the Univerſal Church, and all ſound parts of it, and that nothing elſe is neceſſary to make a Church-Member. Very right! I do own this;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:68"/> but what is my owning this, to the Independents? For they do not, and will not own it; they admit into their Churches, not by Baptiſm, but by a Human and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Covenant, and will own none for Church-Members but ſuch. Baptiſm at moſt gives Men onely a diſpoſition to be Church-Members, but does not make them Members of any Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But they require no new Covenant at Baptiſm,</hi> ergo, <hi>they admit into the Church without any clog or hindrance of human Invention,</hi> that is, they admit to Baptiſm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new Covenant: becauſe Baptiſm does not, as they believe, admit into the Church, <hi>ergo,</hi> they admit into the Church without any clog of human Invention. And yet Sir, I perceive you do not underſtand this matter neither: for though what their practiſe is now I cannot tell, yet according to their Principles, and former Practiſe, though they required no new Covenant of the Child to be Baptized, yet they would Baptize no Children, but of ſuch Parents, as were in Church-Covenant with them, which is the ſame thing; and a much greater clog to Baptiſm, than the Sign of the Croſs, which when I know your exceptions againſt, I will conſider them.</p>
                        <p>And now Sir, nothing remains of your Firſt Letter, but ſome few Queries relating to the meaning of my Text. Your Three firſt Queries come onely to this, whether every particular Church may not be called the Body of Chriſt. I anſwer, no doubt but it may, and yet Chriſt has but one Body, and all the ſound Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the World are but one Body, and muſt be but one Communion. As you may ſee proved at large in the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> and the Vindication of that Defence, and thither I refer you. But what you mean by Chriſts <hi>Metaphorical Body,</hi> I confeſs, I cannot tell, and therefore cannot anſwer that Queſtion.</p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:69"/>
                        <p>Your Fourth Query, concerns the nature of Schiſm, which you would not have conſiſt in dividing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion through difference of Opinions, but through want of Charity, becauſe the Apoſtle ſays, that the Members have the ſame care one of another. Now methinks in the natural Body, ſhould the Members divide from each other, though they ſhould pretend to love one another dearly, they would not be thought to have ſuch care of one another, as the Members of the ſame Body ought to have. The Application is eaſy, and you may find this matter plainly ſtated in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to which I have ſo often referred you.</p>
                        <p>Thus Sir I have honeſtly anſwered all your Queries, which you ſent me in your Firſt Letter, and which you challenge me, and <hi>conjure me</hi> as a Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine to anſwer <hi>Categorically</hi> in your Second; whether they were ſo very conſiderable as to deſerve either to be Printed or Anſwered, I leave the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                        <p>Your Second Letter, though it be ſomewhat Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, yet creates me but little trouble. It has brought forth but one Query, and half of that is already An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whether, if the nature of Catholick Communion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a readineſs to Communicate with any ſound Church, and yet a Church obliges us to Communicate with that alone, while diſtance does not hinder the occaſional and frequent Communion with others, is not that Church guilty of Schiſm in ſuch an Injunction contrary to the nature of Catholick Communion?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> No Church can be ſo ſuppoſed to forbid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any Church, which is in Communion with her: and as for Schiſmatical Conventicles, which you are pleaſed to call ſound Churches, it is the Duty of the Church to forbid all Communion with them,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:69"/> how near ſoever they be. For Catholick Communion obliges us only to Communicate in the Catholick Church, from whence Schiſmaticks have withdrawn and ſeparated themſelves; and whoever Communicates with Schiſmaticks, is in ſo doing a Schiſmatick.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Or at leaſt,</hi> (as you proceed) <hi>is it not impoſſible, that he who Communicates ſometimes with one true Church, ſometimes with another, can be a Schiſmatick, or any more than an Offender againſt a poſitive human Law?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> If ſuch true Churches be Schiſmatical, he that Communicates with a Schiſmatical Church, is Guilty of a Schiſmatical Act; and how is it poſſible, it ſhould be otherwiſe? Should a Man ſometimes joyn with his Princes Forces, and ſometimes with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Fight ſometimes on the one ſide, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the other, were he a Rebel or not? To be ſure he is a Rebel when he Fights againſt his Prince, though ſometimes he Fight for him. We may, and ought as occaſion ſerves to Communicate with any Church, which is in Catholick Communion; but where there are two oppoſite and ſeparate Communions, to Communicate with both, is like taking part on both ſides; and if one be in the right, and the other in the wrong, ſuch a man cannot be in the right al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</p>
                        <p>Well but however, <hi>he is no Schiſmatick, but only an Offender againſt a poſitive human Law.</hi> Yes, certainly he is a Schiſmatick, and an Offender, not meerly againſt human poſitive Laws, but againſt the Unity of the Church, and the Evangelical Laws of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                        <p>But this mention of Law puts me in mind of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or two at the beginning of your Preface. You ſay, <hi>perhaps it's no abſurdity to ſuppoſe, that Men may</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:70"/> 
                           <hi>as well continue Members of the National Church, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their breaking many poſitive Laws, made for the outward management and ordering of it, though not Fundamental and neceſſary to its being; as he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs the penalty of any Statute of the Realm about Civil affairs, may however be a ſound Member of the State, if he keep from Treaſon and other Capital Crimes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Very right Sir! While Men continue in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, they are Church-Members, though they may be irregular, and guilty of ſome Acts of Diſobedience; but methinks it is a little abſurd to ſay, that thoſe continue Members of the Church, who ſeparate from it: Schiſm and Separation from the Church, is juſt what Treaſon and Rebellion is in the State, and ſuch perſons by your own confeſſion ceaſe to be ſound Members.</p>
                        <p>You add, <hi>Nay poſſibly, that there ſhould be ſeveral Religious Aſſemblies, living by different Cuſtoms and Rules, and yet continuing Members of the National Church, is not more inconſiſtent, than, that particular places ſhould have their particular Cuſtoms and By-Laws, differing from the Common Law of the Land, without making a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Government.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whatever variety and difference in the Rules of Worſhip in ſeveral Congregations, is conſiſtent with one Communion, may be granted, when the prudence of Governours ſees it fit and expedient. But Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry</hi>'s project, which I perceive you are nibling at, of making a National Church by an Act of Parliament, which ſhould declare Presbyterians, Independants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Parts of the National Church, is certainly the cunningeſt way of curing Schiſm, that ever was thought on: but you may find that expedient for Union at large conſidered in the Vindication of the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:70"/>
                        <p>And thus Sir I proceed to your Third Letter, and here you run nothing but Dregs and Lees; and I hope you will not think it any neglect of you, if I do not anſwer you Paragraph by Paragraph, as I have done your firſt Letter, there being little new in this, but only a Repetition of your old Queries: and though you know Repetitions are very <hi>convenient to lengthen a Sermon,</hi> there is no need of ſuch Arts to lengthen this Anſwer, which is too long already.</p>
                        <p>Your firſt Charge upon me is, that I only amuſe People with Equivocal Words and Terms: that I play <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Letters</hi> 3. p. 16.</note> with the words, <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Schiſm;</hi> which had been no fault, had I played the right way with them, that is, had I ridiculed them, as you do, who think them words on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit to be played with, who have found out a Church without any Government, which is, only <hi>an Intreague</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>between Clergy-men on all ſides,</hi> who will not allow <hi>cauſeleſs Separation from a Sound part of the Catholick</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Church</hi> to be Schiſm, but place Schiſm <hi>wholly in want of Charity,</hi> and make it nothing elſe but ſome Diviſions and Contentions between the Members of the ſame Church, who ſtill live in Communion with one another; a true Independent Notion to juſtifie cauſeleſs Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Diviſions in the Church are certainly very Sinful, and a degree of Schiſm, as unnatural, as if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Body ſhould fight with each other, while they are United to the ſame Body; but to divide from the ſame Body is the perfection of Schiſm, unleſs a quarrel be a Rent and Schiſm, but Separation be none.</p>
                        <p>You deſire me to define, what I mean by a Church, when conſidered as Catholick and Univerſal, and when taken in a more reſtrained ſenſe. But this, I think I have done already, if you had eyes to ſee it; and you may find it done more largely in the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still.</hi>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:71"/> But would not any Man, who had ever ſeen this diſcourſe, which you undertake to confute, wonder to hear you ask me, <hi>whether a Man has a right to be of a particular</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>Church as he is a Chriſtian;</hi> when the whole deſign of that Tract is to prove, that every Chriſtian by being ſo, is a Member of the Catholick Church, and has a right to Communicate with all ſound parts of the Catholick Church, and bound to Communicate with that part of it, in which he lives?</p>
                        <p>In the next place you attempt to prove, that the Influences and Operations of the Holy Spirit, are not confined to the Viſible, but Inviſible Church: but not <note place="margin">p. 19.</note> to examine your proof of it, which is nothing to the purpoſe, you may conſider, that the Viſible and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church on Earth are not two, but one Church; not that every Member of the Viſible Church is a Member alſo of the Inviſible, that is, every profeſt Chriſtian is not a true Believer; but whoever is not a Member of the Viſible Church, and does not live in Communion with it, when it may be had, is not, that we know of, a Member of the Inviſible Church.</p>
                        <p>We have no way to prove, that any Man is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Inviſible, who is not a Member of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church; and what we do not, and cannot know, does not concern us; ſecret things belong to God, and with him it becomes us to leave them. But this alſo you may find more largely diſcourſt in the Vindication of the Defence.</p>
                        <p>You urge the caſe of Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> who, as you ſay, <hi>in a Council or full repreſentative of that Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 21.</note>

                           <hi>not Communicate with both, or either, without danger of Schiſm themſelves?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is an eaſie matter to put hard Caſes, almoſt about any thing; and if a particular hard Caſe, which either may poſſibly happen, or has ſometimes happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is ſufficient to overthrow a ſtanding and general Rule, and to confute the moſt plain and convincing Evidence for it, there is nothing in Religion can be firm and ſtable. In the very ſame manner Men Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute againſt the Being of a God, and a Providence, againſt the neceſſity of Baptiſm, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, againſt the Apoſtolical Power and Miniſtry, and all Church-Government, againſt the neceſſity of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving many fundamental Articles of our Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many, otherwiſe very good Men, from the Power and Prejudice of Education, or through weakneſs of underſtanding, may be guilty of ſome damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.</p>
                        <p>But muſt there be no ſtanding Laws or Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there may happen ſome hard and difficult Caſes? Does not humane Power make Proviſion againſt ſuch Caſes by Courts of Chancery, or the Prerogative of the Prince, and yet maintain the Authority and Sacredneſs of Laws? And will we not allow God himſelf a Power of Diſpenſing with Laws in hard Caſes, without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of his Laws? Is not Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion a neceſſary Duty, becauſe it may ſo happen, that ſometimes I cannot Communicate with any Church? Is not Schiſm a very grievous and damning ſin, becauſe it may happen, that Men may be unavoidably, innocently, and without a Schiſmatical mind, engaged in a Schiſm?</p>
                        <p>I have evidently proved the neceſſity of Church-Unity and Communion, and the evil and danger of Schiſm; and if you can anſwer the Scripture-Evidence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:72"/> produced in this Cauſe, I will carefully conſider it; but it is no confutation of a plain Law, to urge hard Caſes againſt it, which will overthrow all Laws, that ever were made. If you imagine, or can produce any real Caſe, wherein it is almoſt impoſſible for the Perſons concerned to know, that they are guilty of Schiſm, or to diſcover on which ſide the Schiſm lies, or to avoid it without renouncing all Communion with the Church, which courſe ſoever they take, I leave all ſuch Caſes to God, who knows, when it is fit to diſpence with his own Laws; and will take care of my own Duty according to Scripture-Rules, and not hope to juſtifie the ordinary breach of known Laws by ſome extraordinary Caſes.</p>
                        <p>And yet the Caſe, which you propoſe, is not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable a difficulty, as you imagine. Several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and other places, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Euſeb.</hi> b. 5. cap. 23.</note> Determine the Celebration of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the day of the Reſurrection, not on the Fourteenth Day of the Month, which was the Jewiſh Paſſover, (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute you call <hi>a Miſtake in Arithmetick,</hi> but for what reaſon I know not) the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> at the ſame time decree the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Day, whatever Day of the week it fell on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient Obſervation of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches. Pope <hi>Victor</hi> upon this, writes to ſeveral Biſhops very bitterly againſt them, and was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have them Excommunicated, and did as much as in him lay, denounce the Sentence againſt them. <note place="margin">cap. 24.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this was ill reſented by other Biſhops in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; and particularly <hi>Ireneus</hi> wrote a Letter to him about it, and earneſtly diſſwades him from it, and did prevent it from taking effect, if we will believe <hi>Euſebius.</hi> So far is it from being true, as you aſſert, that Pope <hi>Victor</hi> in a Council Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:72"/> the poor <hi>Aſians;</hi> what he did was only his own Act, which was diſpleaſing to other Biſhops, and which he was forc't to undo. So that here was a great deal of Heat and Warmth, and tendency towards a Schiſm, but no Schiſm followed upon it, among the Catholick Churches.</p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſe Pope <hi>Victor</hi> had Excommunicated the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, and this Excommunication had taken effect, this could not make the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks: for there is a great deal of difference between being caſt out of the Communion of a Church, and forſaking the Communion of a Church. The firſt is matter of cenſure, the ſecond is our own choice; the Firſt is an Eccleſiaſtical Puniſhment, the Second when it is cauſeleſs, is Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>So that had the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Excommunicated the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, unleſs the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches upon this, had made a Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this Excommunication could not make them Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and therefore any one might ſafely Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them without partaking in a Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>Nor was it a juſt reaſon for the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches to have renounced the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they had been Excommunicated by <hi>Victor;</hi> for this had been to do as ill a thing as <hi>Victor</hi> had done, for no other reaſon, but becauſe Pope <hi>Victor</hi> had ſet them an example. And therefore we find Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> of another temper, when he and the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops were threatned in the ſame manner by Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> upon occaſion of that warm Diſpute about rebaptizing Hereticks. At that very time, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Jubaianus,</hi> he declares his reſolution, not to break Communion with any Church or Biſhops upon that account, and therefore not with Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf, notwithſtanding his raſh and furious Cenſures.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:73"/> And concludes, that Patience and Forbearance was the beſt Remedy in ſuch Caſes, and therefore upon this occaſion, he ſays, he wrote his Book <hi>de bono Patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Well, but if the Aſiatick Churches were not Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, yet Pope <hi>Victor</hi> had been a Schiſmatick, had he Excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn Communion from them. And this had made the caſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians very hard: for they muſt either have ſuſpended Communion with both theſe divided Churches, and lived without the comfort and advantages of Chriſtian Communion; or they muſt have rejected the Communion of their own Biſhop, and Churches, or have rejected the Communion of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or have maintained Communion with them both, that is, with two Separate Churches, which according to my Principles, is to Communicate in a Schiſm. If they Communicate with their own Schiſmatical Biſhop, this is to Communicate in a Schiſm, by Communicating with a Schiſmatick; if they Renounce his Communion, when he impoſes no new unlawful Terms of Communion upon them, this is to Separate from a Sound and Orthodox Church, for the ſake of a Schiſmatical Biſhop. If they Communicate with the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> this is to break Communion with their own Biſhop, who has Excommunicated them; if they ſeparate from the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> for no other reaſon, but becauſe they are unjuſtly Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, this is to Separate for an unjuſt cauſe, which is a Schiſm; if they communicate with both, they Communicate with two Separate Churches, and therefore muſt be Schiſmaticks on one ſide or other. If you can find any more difficulties in this matter, you may. And yet after all this, I do believe the Chriſtians of <hi>Rome</hi> might have Communicated both with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:73"/> and <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches without Schiſm; and this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon theſe Principles, which I ſhall briefly explain, and confirm.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Perſonal miſcarriage of the Biſhop in the exerciſe of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Cenſures, cannot involve his whole Church in the guilt of Schiſm, though it may make him a Schiſmatick: and certainly ſince Biſhops are but Men, and Subject to the like paſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, that other men are, it would be a very hard caſe, if his perſonal Schiſm ſhould be imputed to the whole Church.</p>
                        <p>Though the Biſhop have the chief Authority in the Church, yet it is hard to ſay, that every abuſe of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is the Act of the whole Church; and therefore the Church may not be Schiſmatical, when the Biſhop is; and it is poſſible to Communicate with a Church, whoſe Biſhop is a Schiſmatick, without Communicating in the Schiſm. And therefore though <hi>Victor</hi> had Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically Excommunicated the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, the Chriſtians of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time might have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> without partaking in <hi>Victors</hi> Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>For, tho a particular Church-Society conſiſts in that Relation, which is between the Biſhop and his Clergy and People, yet it is poſſible, that the Biſhop in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his Authority may violate the Fundamental Laws of Communion, on which the Chriſtians of ſuch a Church unite into one Body and Society: and when he does ſo, it being an abuſe of his Epiſcopal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is his perſonal fault, which cannot affect the whole Church.</p>
                        <p>The caſe is very plain, where there is an Eſtabliſhed conſtitution in a Church (as it is in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> which obliges the Biſhops as well as People. For ſhould any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop require any thing of his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:74"/> Clergy or People, which is contrary to the Eſtabliſh't Laws and Canons of the Church, or ſhould exerciſe any Authority in Cenſures and Excommunications, which is not allowed him by thoſe Canons, this can in no ſenſe be called the Act of the Church, nor is any one bound to obey him in it; and though ſuch a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhould do any Schiſmatical Act, the Church is not Schiſmatical, becauſe he did not purſue the Laws of the Church, in what he did, but gratified his own Humour and Paſſion. If the Church indeed Unites upon Schiſmatical Principles, as the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> did, whatever the Biſhops do in purſuance of ſuch Principles is the Act of the Church, and if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops be Schiſmaticks, the Church is ſo too; but when there is nothing Schiſmatical in the Conſtitution of the Church, the perſonal Schiſm of Biſhops cannot make their Churches Schiſmatical.</p>
                        <p>And though the Primitive Churches before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire turned Chriſtian had not ſuch a Firm and Legal Conſtitution, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> now has, yet a Conſtitution they had, which conſiſted either of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Rules handed down by Tradition, and confirmed by long cuſtom and uſage, or the Canons of particular Councils, which in ordinary caſes made ſtanding Laws of Diſcipline and Government, and in extraordinary caſes provided for new Emergent difficulties; and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to all theſe poſitive Conſtitutions, they were all under the obligation of that great Law of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion. So that the Government of the Church ſince the Apoſtles days, was never ſo intirely in the Biſhops Breaſt, that what he did, ſhould be thought the Act of the Church, any farther than as he complied with thoſe Laws, by which the Church was to be Governed: and therefore there was reaſon in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:74"/> thoſe days to diſtinguiſh between the Act of the Biſhop and the Act of the Church.</p>
                        <p>As to ſhew you this particularly in the caſe before us. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the time of the Apoſtles had obſerved <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the day of the Reſurrection, which is the firſt day of the week, or the Lords day, the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches on the 14th day of the Month; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to the Laws of that Church, might require all the Members of his Church, to obſerve <hi>Eaſter</hi> according to the uſage of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and might regularly inflict Church-Cenſures upon the obſtinate and refractory; and this would be accounted the Act of the Church, becauſe it was in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Laws and Conſtitutions of it. But there was no Canon, nor Cuſtom in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to deny Communion to Foreign Churches, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their own Cuſtoms in this matter, and would not conform to the Cuſtom of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, there was the Practiſe and Example of Former Times againſt it; for <hi>Anicetus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> received <hi>Polycarp,</hi> an <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhop, to Communion, though they could not agree about this matter. And therefore when <hi>Victor</hi> Schiſmatically Excommunicated the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches for this different obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> it was his Perſonal Act, not the Act of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had no ſuch Law, and owned no ſuch Cuſtom: and therefore though this might make Pope <hi>Victor</hi> a Schiſmatick, it could not make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Schiſmatical; the guilt went no farther than <hi>Victors</hi> Perſon, unleſs other Perſons voluntarily made themſelves guilty, by abetting and eſpouſing the Quarrel.</p>
                        <p>So that had <hi>Victor</hi> perſiſted in his Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches, none had been guilty of Schiſm but himſelf, and ſuch as approved, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:75"/> to it, but the Body of the Clergy and People, who had not conſented unto it, had been Innocent, and therefore any Catholick peaceable Chriſtian, who lived in <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe Days, might have Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> without Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>The like may be ſaid of the Quarrels and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of particular Biſhops, which have ſometimes ended in formal Schiſms, and denouncing Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication againſt each other; which cannot make their Churches Schiſmatical, any further than they take part with their reſpective Biſhops. For this is rather a Perſonal Schiſm and Separation, than a Church Schiſm; neither of them Separate from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, under the Notion of ſuch a Church, though they Separate from each others Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion upon ſome perſonal Quarrels.</p>
                        <p>This was the Caſe of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and ſome other Biſhops in thoſe days, which were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Biſhops, and maintained Communion with the Catholick Church, but yet Separated from each other, which is a very great fault, as all Contentions and Diviſions in the Church are, but has not the Evil and Deſtructive Nature of a Church Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>But you will ſay, can we Communicate with a Church without Communicating with its Biſhop? or can we Communicate with a Schiſmatical Biſhop, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Communicating in his Schiſm?</p>
                        <p>I Anſwer, Yes, we may Communicate with a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Biſhop, without Communicating in his Schiſm. When Schiſm is his perſonal fault, our Communion with him makes us no more guilty of it, than of any other Perſonal fault, our Biſhop is guilty of. While we take care to Communicate with him in no Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Act, no Man is bound to forſake the Communion of the Church for the Perſonal faults of his Biſhop.</p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:75"/>
                        <p>So that the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians might Communicate with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> without Schiſm, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Pope <hi>Victors</hi> Schiſmatical Excommunication of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches. And now the only difficulty that remains is, whether the Chriſtians of <hi>Rome</hi> might have Communicated with the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Victor</hi> had Excommunicated them, for if they could not, then they muſt inevitably partake in <hi>Victors</hi> Schiſm, if his ſentence obliged them to deny Communion to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches. And in anſwer to this we may conſider.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That thoſe, who Condemned the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, did in ſo doing own their Communion, which is one way, and the Principal way of maintaining Communion, between Churches at a Diſtance, who cannot actually Communicate with each other.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That <hi>Victor</hi> being the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had the ſupreme Authority of receiving in, or ſhutting out of the Communion of that Church, if any Perſons of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Communion had come to <hi>Rome,</hi> private Chriſtians could not receive them into the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church without the Biſhops Authority, and therefore could not actually Communicate with them in the publick Offices of Religion, though they owned their Communion; but this is no more their fault, than the Excommunication of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches was; they Communicate with their own Church, and would be very glad that the <hi>Aſians,</hi> that are among them, might be received into Communion, but they have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to do it, and therefore the fault is not theirs, for this is not to Renounce the Communion of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Chriſtians, but is only a forc't Suſpenſion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If the Chriſtians of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould Travel into <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:76"/> I doubt not, but that they might very lawfully Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, notwithſtanding they were Excommunicated by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no juſt cauſe to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Biſhops and Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sentence is void of it ſelf; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians when they are in <hi>Aſia,</hi> are not under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore muſt not forbear nor ſuſpend Communion with the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, unleſs they will juſtifie this Schiſmatical Excommunication. The Juriſdiction of a particular Biſhop is confined within the Bounds of his own Church, and every Chriſtian is Subject to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church where he is; and therefore though the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> cannot receive the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated <hi>Aſians</hi> to their Communion without the Authority of their Biſhop, yet when they are in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> has no Authority over them, they may and ought to joyn themſelves to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, during their abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, if the <hi>Aſians</hi> would receive them without Commendatory Letters from their Biſhop, which they could not have in ſuch a caſe as this.</p>
                        <p>Thus Sir, I have conſidered the Caſe you put about Pope <hi>Victors</hi> Excommunicating the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, which is not a real, but a feigned Caſe, for there was no actual Schiſm upon it, as I perceive ſome body had told you, there was. And yet ſuppoſing it had been ſo, I have ſhewn you, how the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches might have maintained Communion with each other, and that the caſe of private Chriſtians was not ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as you repreſent it.</p>
                        <p>Your following exceptions concerning National Communion, and National Churches, and the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <note place="margin">

                        <p>Your attempt to prove Congregational Churches <note place="margin">p. 24.</note> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. has been ſo often anſwered by the Presbyterian as well as Epiſcopal Divines, that to ſave my ſelf the labour of tranſcribing, I ſhall refer you to them, and particularly to the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nr.</hi> of <hi>Separ. p.</hi> 392. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where you may find this matter largely debated, in anſwer to Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of Churches.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>it is evident that one of theſe</hi> (Separate Churches) <hi>muſt needs be cut off from Chriſts Body.</hi> I readily grant it; for Chriſt has but one Body, which <note place="margin">p. 26.</note> is one Communion; and therefore two Churches, which are not in Communion with each other, cannot both belong to the ſame Body, or the one Catholick Church; but the Church which is the Schiſmatick, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Language of the Primitive times, is out of the Catholick Church, <hi>extra Eccleſiam foris,</hi> as is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſt at large in the Vindication of the Defence.</p>
                        <p>In the next place you endeavour to make me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my ſelf, <hi>in talking of occaſional Communion and occaſional Memberſhip,</hi> and <hi>different Relations,</hi> when elſe where I aſſert, <hi>That the Communion of the Church does not make us Members of any particular Church.</hi> But pray Sir, where do I aſſert this? I am ſure I aſſert the quite contrary, that Church-Communion conſiſts in Church-Memberſhip. I ſay indeed, <hi>That Church-Communion Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and Principally refers to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, not</hi>

                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:77"/> 
                           <hi>any part of it. That Baptiſm, which is the Sacrament of our admiſſion into the Covenant of God, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, does not make us Members of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, as ſuch, but of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> And I do as plainly aſſert, <hi>that every true Catholick Chriſtian is a Member of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, and as ſuch is a Member of every particular Church, which is a ſound part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> That no Man can properly be ſaid to Communicate with any Church, whatever Acts of Communion he may perform in it, who does not Communicate with it as a Member, and that therefore to talk of <hi>Occaſional Communion,</hi> in the ſenſe of our Diſſenters, is as abſurd as to talk of <hi>an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Memberſhip;</hi> theſe are the very Principles on which I diſpute againſt thoſe abſurd Diſtinctions of <note place="margin">p. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>occaſional</hi> Communion, which I confeſs to be <hi>abſurd, and a Contradiction to all the Principles of Catholick Communion,</hi> and therefore you are concerned to anſwer this abſurdity, not I. I have charged this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity upon our Occaſional Communicants, and let any man take it off, that can.</p>
                        <p>But are you not Sir, admirably qualified to Anſwer Books, without ſo much as underſtanding the general ſcope and deſign of the Book you Anſwer, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what makes for you or againſt you?</p>
                        <p>As for your next Queſtion, <hi>How does it appear? that it is neceſſary to Communion with the Catholick Church, that we muſt perform the conſtant Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in that part of the Catholick Church, where we conſtantly live.</hi> You ought inſtead of asking this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to have ſhown, that what proofs I have alleadged for this are not concluſive, or do not ſufficiently prove the thing; but your Queſtion inſinuates, that I have ſaid nothing at all about it, or at leaſt that you do not know, that I have, though it be the Principal Deſign
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:77"/> of that diſcourſe, and then I am a very careleſs writer, or you a very careleſs Reader. But the Anſwer to it in ſhort is this, That every Chriſtian is Bound to live in Communion with the Catholick Church, no Man lives in Communion with the Church, who does not perform the External viſible Acts of Communion, when he may do it without ſin; The whole Catholick Church being but one Communion, whoever Communicates with any ſound part of it, Communicates with the whole; no Man can ordinarily Communicate in a Church, in which he does not ordinarily live, and therefore if he be bound at all to the External and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Acts of Communion, he muſt perform them in the Church wherein he lives, and in ſo doing, if it be a true Catholick Church, he lives in Communion with the whole Catholick Church.</p>
                        <p>But you attempt to prove, <hi>That you are not bound to Communicate ſo much as ſometimes with a ſound part of</hi>

                           <hi>the Catholick Church, becauſe you live where there is ſuch an one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this you prove from Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who ſays, that <hi>if you</hi> (ſpeaking to the Papiſts) <hi>require the belief of any Error among the conditions of your Communion, our Obligation to Communion with you ceaſeth.</hi> Now is not this an admirable proof, that we are not bound to Communicate with a ſound part of the Church, where we live, becauſe we are not bound to Communicate with an erroneous Church, which impoſes the belief of her Errours as Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Is not this a wonderful ſound Church? And are not you a very ſubtil Arguer?</p>
                        <p>You produce another paſſage of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> by which I cannot tell what you intend to prove, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be, that there is no need, there ſhould be any External or Viſible Church-Society, ſo Men do but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:78"/> Profeſs the Faith of Chriſt; which ſeems to be the ſence of your foregoing Paragraph. But the words are theſe; <hi>I believe our Saviour ever ſince his Aſcenſion, hath had in ſome place or other a Viſible true Church on Earth, I mean, a Company of Men, that profeſt at leaſt ſo much as was neceſſary to Salvation; and I believe there will be ſome where or other ſuch a Church to the Worlds end.</hi> This is his anſwer to that Popiſh Queſtion about <hi>the perpetuity of the Viſible Church;</hi> whereby it appears, that this <hi>Company of Men</hi> he ſpeaks of, are not ſingle and ſcattered Individuals, which are no Viſible Church, but he means a Formed and Viſible Church-Society: and his Anſwer is true, though there were never a ſound Church in the World. For a corrupt Church, which retains all the Eſſentials of Faith and Worſhip, is a true Viſible Church, and this is the meaning of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Anſwer; but how this proves, that there is no need there ſhould be any Viſible Church at all, or that Chriſtians are not bound to actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the ſound and Orthodox Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live, is paſt my underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame rate you defend your ſelf againſt me in your Preface, by the Authority of thoſe two excellent Perſons, the Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Dean of Saint <hi>Pauls.</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had aſſerted, <hi>That all things neceſſary to Salvation, are plain in Scripture, to all that ſincerely endeavour to underſtand them;</hi> hence S.

                           <hi>Conſtitutions, and Ordinances, have been compoſed and enjoyned by an uſurped Authority;</hi> and if he had added, as he might have done with the ſame reaſon, And all Church-Communion is needleſs, it had been exactly what you aim at in this Citation. The Dr. vindicates
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:78"/> his Doctrine from ſuch a wild Fanatical inference. 1. By ſhewing <hi>the intention of thoſe Principles, which was plainly to lay down the Foundations of a Chriſtian Faith, living in the Communion of our Church.</hi> And if this was his deſign, as he ſays, it was, certainly he could neither before nor after ſay any thing, which ſhould overthrow the neceſſity of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and then he can ſay nothing againſt me, nor for you. 2. He diſtinguiſhes between <hi>the neceſſaries to Salvation, and to the Government of the Church:</hi> that is, what is neceſſary for every Chriſtian, conſidered in <note place="margin">p. 275.</note> a private Capacity to know and believe, to make him capable of Salvation; and what care the Church muſt take <hi>to inſtruct the ignorant, to ſatisfie the doubting, to direct the unskilful, and to help the weak; and not barely to provide for neceſſity but ſafety, and not barely the ſafety of particular perſons, but of it ſelf; which cannot</hi>

                           <hi>be done without prudent Orders, ſetting the bounds of Mens Employments,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. though it is poſſible for a private Chriſtian, who lives alone, and has the uſe of the Bible in a Language which he underſtands, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and honeſt inquiries to find out ſo much truth, as is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, yet this does not overthrow the neceſſity of a ſetled Miniſtry, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Authority in the Church; all this I firmly aſſent to, and yet do as firmly believe the neceſſity of Church-Communion, when it may be had upon Lawful Terms, and ſo does this Reverend Perſon alſo: and therefore I cannot look upon your alleadging his Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, to have any other deſign than to affront the Dean for his excellent Pains in vindicating the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of our Church, and ſhewing people the Evil and Danger of Separation. He has ſufficiently declared what his Judgment is about Separation, and therefore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:79"/> I need not concern my ſelf any farther to prove that he is not my Adverſary in this Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame rate you deal with that <hi>great Man</hi> (as you deſervedly call him) Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> who ſays, <hi>I had much rather perſwade any one to be a good Man, than</hi>

                           <hi>to be of any Party and denomination of Chriſtians whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; for I doubt not but the belief of the Ancient Creed, provided we entertain nothing that is deſtructive of it, together with a good life, will certainly ſave a Man; and without this, no man can have reaſonable hopes of Salvation, no not in an Infallible Church, if there were any ſuch to be found in the World.</hi> How does this oppoſe me, who aſſert the neceſſity of Church-Communion? Is the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> then, and the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> no part of our Creed? and is not Schiſm deſtructive to theſe great Articles of our Faith? or is Schiſm, which is the breach of Chriſtian Charity properly ſo called (which is the Love and Charity, which the Members of the ſame Body, ought to have for each other, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Unity and Communion) conſiſtent with a good Life, if by that we underſtand an Univerſal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which Charity is the moſt vital and eſſential part?</p>
                        <p>But do you indeed think, Sir, that the Dean believes a Man may be ſaved without Communion with any Church, when it may be had without Sin? when in the very next Paragraph he ſo earneſtly exhorts them to Communion with the Church of <hi>England?</hi> I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily forgive your uſage of me, ſince I find you cannot Read the beſt Books without perverting them, and that you never ſpare any Mans Reputation to ſerve your Deſignes: for your Reproaches and your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations are but different ways of abuſe, though I confeſs, I ſhould rather chuſe to be reproached by you.</p>

                        <p>Your laſt Conſideration is, whether it be a good way to convert Schiſmaticks, to prove <hi>that Schiſm is as</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Letter</hi> 3. p. 29.</note> 
                           <hi>Damning a Sin, as Murder or Adultery.</hi> Truly Sir, <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> and <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> and all the Ancient Fathers of the Church, thought this a very good way, for they inſiſted very much upon this Argument; and if Men will not forſake their Schiſm, though the Salvation of their Souls be endangered by it, I am apt to think, that no other Arguments will perſwade them. And if this be true (as I verily believe it is, and ſhall believe ſo, till I ſee the Third Chapter of the Vindication of the Defence of Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> fairly anſwered) I think it the greateſt Charity in the World, to warn Men of it; and if it ſhould prove by their perverſeneſs no Charity to them, it is Charity to my own Soul, and delivers me from the guilt of their Bloud, whether ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Preach Men into, or out of, the Church.</p>
                        <p>And now for your parting Blow. <hi>Certainly if our Church required Conformity to its Rites and Ceremonies as neceſſary to Salvation, It could not blame Men for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding from it. Yes certainly</hi> upon ſuch a Suppoſition, the Church could and would blame Men for their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, though it may be, they might not deſerve to be blamed: for no doubt, the more neceſſary the Church judges her Conſtitutions, the more ſhe will blame Diſſenters.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>he, who tells us, or he ſaies nothing, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit confines his Influences and Operations to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church in ſuch Conformity, not only makes ſuch Conformity neceſſary to Salvation, but imputes to the Church the Damnation of many Thouſands of Souls, who might expect to be ſaved upon other Terms.</hi> That the Divine Spirit confines his influences (ordinarily) to the Unity of the Church I do aſſert, but that this is <hi>in Conformity to the Church</hi>
                           <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:80"/> 
                           <hi>of England,</hi> I do not aſſert. For Conformity to the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not Eſſential to the Unity of the Catholick Church: for every Church has authority to preſcribe its own Rites and Ceremonies of Worſhip, in Conformity to the general Rules of the Goſpel. And therefore though the Unity of the Church is neceſſary to intitle Men to the ordinary influences of Gods Grace, and conſequently is neceſſary to Salvation, yet Conformity to the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Unity of the Church, becauſe Chriſtians who live under the Government and Juriſdiction of other Churches, may and do preſerve the Unity of the Church without conformity to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Obedience indeed, and Subjection to Church-Authority in all Lawful things, is neceſſary to the Unity of the Church, and neceſſary to Salvation, and conſequently it is a neceſſary Duty to conform to all the Lawful and Innocent Cuſtoms of the Church wherein we live; but this does not make the particular Laws of Conformity, which are different in different Churches, to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, unleſs you will ſay the Church has no Authority but only in things abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation; which deſtroys all the external Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſcipline of the Church, and charges all the Churches in the World, with deſtroying Mens Souls, if any perſons be ſo Humorſom and Peeviſh as to break Communion with them for ſuch Reaſons. But ſuch kind of Cavils as theſe, you may find anſwered at large in the Vindication of the Defence; and thither I refer you, if you deſire to ſee any more of it.</p>
                        <p>Thus Sir, I have with great patience anſwered your Queſtions, not that they needed or deſerved any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but that you might not think your ſelf too much deſpiſed, nor other weak People think your Queſtions
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52190:80"/> unanſwered. And now I have given you an Anſwer, I ſhall take the Confidence to give you a little Ghoſtly Counſel too, which you need a great deal more than an Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>I have not troubled my Head to inquire Scrupulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who you are, nor do I uſe to truſt Common Fame in ſuch matters: but though I know not you, yet I perceive you know me; and if as you ſay, <hi>you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>heard me with great Satisfaction, and as you hope not without edifying thereby,</hi> I think it would have become you to have treated me with a little more Civility than you have done, if it be in your Nature to be Civil to a Clergy-Man. And I wiſh more for your own ſake, than for mine, you had done ſo; for I thank God I have learnt not only by the precepts and example of my great Maſter, but by frequent Tryals, to go through good Report and evil Report, and to bear the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious and Spightful Reflections with an equal mind. But as contemptible as a Clergy-Man is now, theſe things will be accounted for another day.</p>
                        <p>For it is very evident, that you have a great Spight at the whole Order, whatever perſonal kindneſs you may have for ſome Men; they are but <hi>a Herd of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men,</hi> and you know no other uſe of a Biſhop, but <hi>to overſee, admoniſh, and Cenſure thoſe, who are apt to</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Preface.</note> 
                           <hi>go beyond their due Bounds.</hi> I confeſs this way of Railery is grown very faſhionable, and I perceive you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be in the Mode, and to be an accompliſht Gentleman; but I never knew a man that was ſeriouſly religious, who durſt affront the Servants for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſake.</p>
                        <p>But you Sir, are in the very height of the faſhion, and think their Office as contemptible, as their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons generally are thought to be: <hi>you hope to be ſaved without underſtanding the Notion of Church-Government as</hi>
                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52190:81"/> 
                           <hi>'tis intreagued by Clergy-men of all ſides.</hi> And I hope you may be ſaved without underſtanding a great many other things beſides Church-Government, or elſe I doubt your Salvation may be hazardous.</p>
                        <p>But this is too plain a contempt of all Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has uſurpt an unlimited and Tyrannical Power under the Notion of Church-Government, yet what has the <hi>Sound Church of England</hi> (as you own it) done? What occaſion did I give for this Cenſure? who have expreſly confined <hi>the Exerciſe of Church-Authority to Church-Communion, to receiving in, and putting out of the Church.</hi> And if <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reſol. of Caſes,</hi> p. 39.</note> the Church be no Society, I would deſire to know what it is; and if be a Society, how can any Society ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without Authority in ſome Perſons to receive in and to ſhut out of the Society? But the truth is, tho you pretend to be in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you make the Church it ſelf a very needleſs and inſignificant thing, for you know no neceſſity of Communicating with any Church, you will not allow it to be Schiſm to Separate from the Church, you think it a pretty indifferent thing, whether Men be Baptized or not, or by whom they are Baptized: what your Opinion is about the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I do not know, though if you are conſiſtent with your ſelf, I doubt that is a very indifferent Ceremony too.</p>
                        <p>Truly to deal plainly with you, I think you have more need to be taught your Catechiſm than to ſet up for a Writer of Books; and let me in time warn you, what the conſequence of this way you are in, is likely to be, which is no leſs than a contempt of all revealed and inſtitute Religion, and conſequently of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. Natural Religion may ſubſiſt without any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitutions, but revealed Religion never did, and never can; for when God Tranſacts with Mankind in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52190:81"/> the way of a Viſible Covenant, there muſt be ſome Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Miniſters, and Viſible Sacraments of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And when the Evangelical Miniſters and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fall into contempt, Men muſt think meanly of Chriſtianity, and return to what they call natural Religion, which is a Religion without a Prieſt and without a Sacrifice; which cannot ſave a Sinner, but by uncovenanted Grace and Mercy; which no Man can be ſure of, and which no Man ſhall find, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects a Prieſt and Sacrifice of Gods providing.</p>
                        <p>And to convince you of this, you may obſerve, that the contempt of the Notion of a Church, of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prieſthood and Sacraments, is originally owing to <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> to thoſe who profeſs to believe in God, and to worſhip him according to the Laws of natural Religion, but believe nothing at all of Chriſt; or to thoſe, who profeſs to believe in Chriſt, but believe him only to be a meer Man, and a great Reformer of Natural Religion, but make nothing at all of his Prieſthood and Sacrifice. If Chriſt be our great High Prieſt, and we muſt hope for Salvation only in vertue of his Sacrifice, There muſt be ſome way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to apply his Merits and Salvation to us, and this will convince us of the neceſſity of Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and a viſible Confederation by Sacraments <note place="margin">
                              <hi>See Vindic. of the Def.</hi> cap. 3.</note> of divine appointment: But if Chriſt came only as a great Prophet to inſtruct us more perfectly in the Rules of Vertue, and to give us more certain Hopes of a future State, there can be no more neceſſity of a Church now, than there was in a State of Nature. Chriſtians may aſſociate, if they pleaſe, for Acts of publick worſhip, and they may break Company, when they pleaſe, without any danger; and the Evangelical Sacraments can be only ſignificant Ceremonies,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52190:82"/> which may be uſed or let alone, as every one likes beſt.</p>
                        <p>At this Rate you every where diſcourſe; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo well of our Diſſenters, that though they would be glad to be excuſed from the guilt of Schiſm, yet they will not thank you, for excuſing them upon ſuch Principles, as tend to undermine Chriſtianity; and I believe ſo well of you, that though you affect to talk in the modiſh way, yet you do not underſtand whither it tends: and I hope this timely Caution may prevent your embracing thoſe Principles, whereon your Concluſions are Naturally Built.</p>
                        <p>Another thing I would warn you of, is, that theſe looſe Principles of Church-Communion do not tempt you to Schiſm, and State-Factions, which uſually go together. You pretend indeed to be in conſtant Communion with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but according to the Principles of your Letters no Church in the World can have any hold of you, every Man is a Communicant at his own pleaſure who thinks he may part without Sin; And it is much to be ſuſpected, that no Man, who is a hearty lover of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> can make ſuch a Zealous Defence for Diſſenters, who has not ſome private reaſons for his Zeal: and when Men are not Endeared to each other by one Communion, it is to be feared they are linked together by ſome other Common Intereſt. Now ſhould you prove a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, to ſay no worſe, it will not excuſe you, how many Fine Queſtions ſoever you can ask about it.</p>
                        <p>And that which will greatly endanger you, is that great Opinion you have of your ſelf: for ſome men are ſo wanton as to eſpouſe a Schiſm or Faction only to ſhew their Wit in Defending it, and to make themſelves conſiderable by eſpouſing a Party. I will not ſo much wrong you, as to ſay that you have ſhewn any great
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52190:82"/> Wit or Judgment in this Cauſe; but it is evident to every impartial Man, who reads your Letters, that you have betrayed too great a conceit of both, and that is a great deal the more dangerous of the two; for true Wit and Judgment will ſecure Men from thoſe miſchiefs, which a vain conceit of it betrays them to.</p>
                        <p>And now Sir, all that I ſhall add, concerns your way of Writing, which neither becomes a wiſe Man, nor a fair Diſputant; you have not offered any Argument to diſprove any one thing I have ſaid, you have no where ſhewn the weakneſs of my Arguments to prove what I undertook, but have at all Adventures askt a great many Queſtions, and generally nothing to the purpoſe. Now it had been eaſie to have askt you as many croſs Queſtions, which had been as good an Anſwer to your Queſtions, as your Queſtions are to my Diſcourſe; and thus People might have gazed on us, and have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the wiſer. For to raiſe a great many difficulties onely tends to Scepticiſm, and will never end a Diſpute. I am loth to mind you of the Proverb, becauſe I do not think the application belongs to you; but yet it ſhould make any Man of Wit aſhamed of ſuch Methods of Diſpute, wherein he may be out-done by a Man of no Wit.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs I have with ſome regret ſtole time from better Employment to anſwer your Letters, but do not think my ſelf bound to do ſo, as often as you think fit to give a publick Challenge. This Controverſie, if you had pleaſed, might have been ended more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; which had been leſs trouble to me, though it may be you thought it might have been leſs glorious to your ſelf, which I preſume was your reaſon of firſt ſpreading your Letter in Writing, and then of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it. I ſhall not envy your Glory; I had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52190:83"/> mean and obſcure in a humble Obedience to Church and State, than to raiſe the moſt Glorious Triumphs and Trophees to my memory, by giving the leaſt diſturbance to either. And that you and all ſober Chriſtians may be of the ſame mind, is the hearty Prayer of,</p>

                        <p>To aſſist Perſons in this Enquiry, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that of late ſeveral of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have undertaken the moſt material Points that you do queſtion, and have handled them with that Candor and Calmneſs which becomes their Profeſſion, and the gravity of the Arguments, and which may the better invite thoſe that are willing to be ſatisfied, to peruſe and conſider them. But becauſe Truth and Reaſon do too often ſuffer by the Prejudices we have againſt particular Perſons; to remove, as much as may be, that Obſtruction, I have in this Treatiſe ſhewed, that theſe Authors are not alone, but have the concurrent Teſtimony of the moſt eminent Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts for them, who do generally grant, that there is nothing required in the Parochial Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that can be a ſufficient reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:52190:86"/> for Separation from it. The ſence of many of theſe I have here collected; and for one hundred, I could eaſily have produced two, if the Cauſe were to go by the Poll: So that if Reaſon or Authority will prevail, I hope that yet your Satisfaction and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to the Communion of the Church, is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of: Which God of his infinite Mercy grant, for your own and the Churches ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <head>THE NON-CONFORMISTS PLEA FOR <hi>Lay-Communion</hi> With the CHURCH of ENGLAND.</head>
                        <p>THE Chriſtian World is divided into two Ranks, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, uſually known by the Names of <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Clergy, beſides the things eſſentially belonging to their Office, are, by the Laws of all well-ordered Churches in the World, ſtrictly obliged, by Declarations or Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or both, to own and maintain the Doctrine, Diſcipline and Conſtitution of the Church into which they are admitted. Thus in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they do ſubſcribe to the Truth of the Doctrine more eſpecially contained in the thirty nine Articles, and declare that they will uſe the Forms and Rites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Liturgy, and promiſe to ſubmit to the Government in its Orders. The deſign of all which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:89"/> is to preſerve the Peace of the Church, and the Unity of Chriſtians, which doth much depend upon that of its Officers and Teachers.</p>
                        <p>But the Laity are under no ſuch Obligations, there being no Declarations or Subſcriptions required of them, nor any thing more than to attend upon, and joyn with the Worſhip practiſed and allowed in the Church. Thus it is in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to whom when it <note place="margin">Defence of the Cure, part 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 29.</note> was objected, that many Errors in Doctrine and Life were impoſed as Conditions of Communion; he replies, <hi>What is impoſed on you as a Condition to your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Doctrine and Prayers of the Pariſh-Churches, but your actual Communion it ſelf?</hi> In diſcourſing therefore about the Lawfulneſs of Communion with a Church, the Difference betwixt theſe two muſt be carefully obſerved, leſt the things required only of one Order of Men ſhould be thought to belong to all. It's obſerved by one, <hi>That the Original of all Our Miſchiefs</hi>

                           <hi>ſprung from Mens confounding the terms of Miniſterial Conformity, with thoſe of Lay-Communion with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Aſſemblies; there being much more required of the Miniſters than of the People: Private Perſons having much leſs to ſay for themſelves in abſenting from the publick Worſhip of God, tho performed by the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, than the Paſtor hath for not taking Oaths,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly, if this Difference were but obſerv'd, and the Caſe of Lay-Communion truly ſtated and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>the People would not be far more averſe to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>

                           <hi>with the Pariſh-Churches than the Nonconforming Miniſters are,</hi> as one complains; and whatſoever they might think of the Conformity of Miniſters, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the previous Terms required of them, they would judg what is required of the People to be lawful,</hi> as ſome <note place="margin">Continuat.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:89"/> Caſe to the People's, may ſee Communion then to be lawful, and find themſelves obliged to maintain it in a private Capacity; ſo the People, by perceiving their Caſe not to be that of the the Miniſters, but widely different from it, would be induced to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church, and to joyn with thoſe of their Miniſters that think it their Duty ſo to do; and are therein of the opinion of the old Non-Conformiſts that did not act <note n="*" place="margin">

                           </note> 
                           <hi>as if there were no middle between Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Church and true Worſhip thereof, and Subſcription unto, or Practice or Approbation of all the Corruptions of the ſame.</hi> For <note n="†" place="margin">

                           <hi>though they would not ſubſcribe to the Ceremonies, yet they were againſt Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God's publick Worſhip,</hi> as one of them in the name of the reſt doth declare. So that as great a Difference as there is betwixt Preſence and Conſent, betwixt bare Communion and Approbation, betwixt the Office of the Miniſter and the Attendance of a private Perſon; ſo much is there betwixt the Caſe of Miniſterial and Lay-Communion: And therefore when we conſider the Caſe of Lay-Communion, we are only to reſpect what is required of the People, what part they are to have and exerciſe in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church. Now what they are concerned in, are either, the Forms that are impoſed, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures they are to uſe, and the Times they are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, for the Celebration of Divine Worſhip; or, the Miniſtration, which they may be remotely ſuppos'd alſo to be concerned in.</p>
                        <p>The lawfulneſs of all which, and of all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Lay-Communion amongſt us, I ſhall not undertake to prove and maintain by Arguments taken from thoſe that already are in full Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo are obliged to juſtify it; but from thoſe that in ſome things do differ from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:90"/> it, who may therefore be ſuppoſed to be impartial, and whoſe Reaſons may be the more heeded as coming from themſelves, and from ſuch that are forward in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects to own the Miſcarriages of the Church, as thoſe that wholly ſeparate from it.</p>
                        <p>For the better underſtanding of the Caſe, and of their Judgment in it, I ſhall conſider,</p>

                           <hi>Laſtly;</hi> When they do grant that Edification may ſerve to guide us, and that we may hear where we can moſt profit, it's with ſuch Limitations and Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe: it muſt be <hi>ſeldom, in a great Caſe,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Offence</hi> and <hi>Contempt.</hi> 
                           <q>Thus Mr. <hi>Hilderſham:</hi> I <note place="margin">Lect. 54. <hi>p.</hi> 253.</note> dare not condemn ſuch Chriſtians, as, having Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in the places where they live of meaner Gifts, do deſire (ſo they do it without open breach or contempt of the Churches Order) to enjoy the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of ſuch as have better Gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo they do it without contempt of their own Paſtors, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scandal and Offence to them and their People.</q> So again: <hi>You ought not to leave your own Paſtor at any</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>From all which we may conclude, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of better Edification is no ſufficient Reaſon for Separation from a Church, Worſhip, or Miniſtry, without there be other Reaſons that do accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it: and then it is not for this Reaſon, ſo much as thoſe it is in conjunction with.</p>
                        <p>But admitting this, yet it will hardly be granted to be a reaſon for Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if the Teſtimony of many worthy Perſons be of any Conſideration. <q>Thus Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <note place="margin">Lect. 29. <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> when he is reproving ſuch as make no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

They ſin againſt themſelves in the Profit they might receive by the Worſhip of God—. There is no part of God's Service, (not the Confeſſion, not the Prayers, not the Pſalms, not the Bleſſing) but it concerns every one, and every one may receive Edification by it.</q> 
                           <q>This he otherwhere repeats, and ſaith; By the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <note place="margin">Lect. 28 <hi>p.</hi> 129.</note> and all other Prayers uſed in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, a Man may receive more Profit than by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other.</q> 
                           <q>Of this Opinion, as to the moſt of the Prayers in our Liturgy, were the old Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts: We are perſwaded, that not only ſome few <note place="margin">Letter of the Miniſt. in <hi>Old-England</hi> to the Brethren in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> p. 13.</note> ſelect Prayers, but many Prayers and other Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may lawfully be uſed, with Fruit and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God's People.</q>

                           <q>And, That the Word of God interpreted and applied by preaching in this way, is a choice Mercy and Gift, wherewith God hath bleſſed this Nation for many Years, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Edification of many thouſands.</q> And he afterwards aſcribes the want of Edification to the prejudices of People; <hi>Such reaſonings,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>againſt</hi>

                              <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:111"/> in; If we look to experience of former Times, there is now ground to expect a Bleſſing from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Preachers, as well, or rather more, than from Preachers of the ſeparated Churches. Sure the converſion, conſolation, ſtrengthening, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Souls in the Truth, has been more in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from Preachers, who were Enemies to Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether Non-conformiſts to Ceremonies, or Conformiſts, Presbyterial or Epiſcopal, even from Biſhops themſelves, than from the beſt of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts. I think all that are acquainted with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of things in the laſt Age, will acknowledg that more good hath been done to the Souls of Men, by the Preaching of <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, Potter, Abbot, Jewel,</hi> and ſome other Biſhops; by <hi>Preſton, Sibbs, Taylor, Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hilderſham, Ball, Perkins, Dod, Stock,</hi> and many thouſands, Adverſaries to the ſeparated Churches, than ever was done by <hi>Ainſworth, Johnſon, Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> rigid Separatiſts, or <hi>Cotton, Thomas Hooker,</hi> and others (though Men of precious Memory) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the way of the Churches Congregational. And therefore if the Biſhops and Conforming Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers now apply themſelves (as we hope, when the heat of Contention is more allayed, they will) to the profitable way of preaching againſt Popery and Prophaneneſs, exciting their Auditors to the Life of Faith in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there may be as good Ground, if not better (conſidering how much the Spirits of Separatiſts are for their Party, and <hi>the ſpeaking of the Truth in Love, and edifying in Love,</hi> is neceſſary to <hi>the growth of the Body;</hi> Epheſ. 4. 16.) to expect by them a Bleſſing in promoting the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, than from the Separatiſts.</q> So that whether we conſider the Worſhip or Doctrine, or the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, the Church of <hi>England</hi> in their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:112"/> doth not want a ſufficiency of Means for the Converſion and Edification of Souls: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Argument taken from Edification, in juſtification of forſaking the Communion of it, is incluſive and of no force. But this branch of it will be further confirmed under the third General.</p>
                        <p>But however, this will not be ſo eaſily quitted, for ſuppoſing the Doctrine good, and thoſe that teach it capable (as far as Learning and Parts are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite) to improve it to the Converſion and Edification of others; yet if they themſelves are looſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, it may give juſt Offence, and be thought a ſufficient cauſe to ſeparate from the Worſhip in which ſuch do officiate.</p>
                        <p>P. 3. Therefore I ſhall ſhew, that the badneſs of the Miniſters is of it ſelf no ſufficient Reaſon to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Communion of a Church, or to ſeparate from the Worſhip adminiſtred in it. <q>What holy Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſaith, is a great Truth: It is not to be denied, <note place="margin">Seven Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Tract. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4 <hi>p.</hi> 223.</note> but that the Example of ignorant and unreformed, eſpecially notorious Perſons in the Miniſtry, hath done and doth much harm; and if either they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be convicted, or if their Crimes be ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove them out of their places, there is juſt cauſe of Grief, that ſuch ſhould have any thing to do in God's Matters, which are ſo weighty, and to be dealt withal in high Reverence.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But yet before the Objection is admitted, it is to be premiſed, 1. That if there be ſuch in the Church, it doth not proceed from their Conformity to it. For good and pious Men of this ſort always were, and ſtill are in the Church. <q>What there were formerly, <note place="margin">Defence, part 1. <hi>p.</hi> 57.</note> may be read in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who thus delivers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: When I think what learned, holy, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men, abundance of the old Conformiſts were, my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:112"/> Heart riſeth againſt the thoughts of ſeparating from them; ſuch as Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whately,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> &amp;c. and abundance other ſuch; yea, ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Grindal,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> &amp;c. yea, and the Martyrs too, as <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </q> What there are now in the Church, he alſo tells us; <hi>I believe there are many hundred godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> 
                           <hi>in the Pariſh-Churches of</hi> England. And of his own knowledg, ſaith, <q>I profeſs to know thoſe of <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> them, whom I take to be much better than my ſelf; I will ſay a greater word, that I know thoſe of them whom I think as godly and humble Miniſters, as moſt of the Non-Conformiſts whom I know.</q> 
                           <q>So ſaith Dr. <hi>Bryan,</hi> In ſome Countries, I am ſure there are <note place="margin">Dwelling with God, <hi>Serm.</hi> 6. p. 313.</note> many Sober, Godly, Orthodox, able Preachers yet in poſſeſſion of the publick Places.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. It is to be premiſed, that this Argument, if of any, yet is of no farther force than againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations where ſuch are, and ſo is of none againſt the Church it ſelf, where are good as well as bad, nor againſt Parochial Communion where ſuch are not. So Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> argues; <hi>I doubt not but there are many</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Defence. part 1. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> 
                           <hi>hundred Pariſh Miniſters, who preach holily, and live holily, though I could wiſh that they were more. And what reaſon have you to charge any other Mens Sins on them,</hi> &amp;c. or to think it unlawful to join with the Good for the ſake of the Bad? this is to condemn the Sound for the ſake of the Infected.</p>
                        <p>Having premiſed this, we ſhall re-aſſume the Caſe, and conſider how it is ſtated and reſolved by them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It's granted, that it is not unlawful to join with bad Miniſters in ſome Caſes where they may have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <q>So Mr. <hi>Rogers;</hi> As it is far from me to be a <note place="margin">Tract. 3. p. 223.</note> Patron of ſuch, or to juſtify them; ſo yet, while we may enjoy the Miniſtry of better, I would not

It is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Temptation, in a time of Differences, to think we cannot run too far from them we differ from; and ſo whilſt we decline one Rock, we ſplit upon another. Remember the old Non-conformiſts were equal Enemies to Superſtition and Separation. Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (I beſeech you) ſober Principles, ſuch as theſe are, that every defective Miniſtry, is not a falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; that ſinful Super-additions, do not nullify Divine Inſtitutions; that ſinful Defects in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do not hinder the ſaving Effects of them. That there is a difference betwixt directing a Worſhip, preſcribing things ſimply Evil, and manifeſtly Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and directing about Worſhip, things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully good being injoined, but the unqueſtionable Subſtance of Worſhip being maintained.

                        <p>1. The uſe of Forms is declared by them to be a thing lawful in it ſelf, and what God hath left us at liberty to uſe, or not to uſe, as we ſee occaſion. <q>So Mr. <hi>Ball;</hi> The Word of God doth not preſcribe <note place="margin">Tryal, <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 36, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> any particular Form, ſtinted or not ſtinted, as neceſſary, but doth warrant both as allowable; for where nothing is in particular commanded touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the external Form of Words and Order, in which our Petitions ſhould be preſented to the Lord, there we are left at liberty. And to put Religion, in reading or uttering Words, in a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or conceived Form, What is it leſs than Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

                        <p>THE Foundation of this Pretence ſeems to be the great miſtake of ſome Men concerning the matter whereof the Church of Chriſt is to be compoſed, which they will have to be, only real Saints and perſons endowed with inherent and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial holineſs; Accordingly finding in the Communion of our Church many corrupt Members, who lived not anſwerable to their Holy Vocation, they, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, amongſt ſome others alledg'd by them, cry her down as no true Church, or, which is all one, deal by her as if ſhe was ſo totally ſeparating from her Communion and ſetting up Churches of their own, conſiſting wholly of Perſons, in their Judgment, far more pure, that is, really holy and Sanctified. Into this moſt falſe and

                        <p>The not rightly underſtanding the notion of that holineſs, that ſo often in Scripture is applied to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of God. There is a twofold holineſs in Scripture, <hi>Inherent</hi> and <hi>Relative.</hi>

                           <hi>ſaints, the ſanctified, the call'd and choſen in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> becauſe they, as of old the <hi>Jews,</hi> had entertain'd the profeſſion of a Religion, diſtinct from others of the World, whereby they might be excited to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of thoſe excellencies, which in the object of their Worſhip they did admire and adore; and thoſe Names being of as large a meaning as that of Chriſtian, ſhew rather what they ought to have been, than aſſure us what they really were; for amongſt thoſe Saints were found ſtrange immortalities altogether contradictory to the ſacredneſs of their Vocation.</p>
                        <p>But does not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Chriſt loved the Church</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25.</note> 
                           <hi>and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer; Holineſs in this place muſt be confeſt to be meant a real and inward holineſs; but then by Church, is not to be underſtood the whole complex
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:129"/> Body of the Univerſal Church in this World, but either that part of it that in this World is really, tho' imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, holy, and is every day preſſing forwards to higher degrees of it, or elſe that Church which ſhall be in the future ſtate, when all the corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Members ſhall be by death and the final deciſion of God, for ever excommunicated out of it, and all the Members that remain in it, only ſuch as were in ſome acceptable degrees holy here, and ſhall then be perfected in holineſs. Neither is this to make two Churches of Chriſt, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> objected, one, in which good and bad are mingled together, and another, in which there are good alone; but only to aſſign two different ſtates of the ſame Church, the one in this World, compos'd of good and bad, externally holy in reſpect of all by vocation, and internally holy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome in it by ſanctification; the other in the next World, where there ſhall be a ſeparation made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sheep and the Goats, and all remaining in the Church, ſuch, as ſhall at once be perfectly holy and compleatly happy: This is that Church which Chriſt ſhall preſent to himſelf, glorious, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing, but holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh.</p>
                        <p>This being ſpupos'd, all that will be needful to ſay, in anſwer to this Queſtion, may be comprehended under theſe three Propoſitions.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>That every ſuch Member has a right to all the external Priviledges of the Church, till by his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſome notorious and ſcandalous ſins he has forfeited that right, and by the juſt cenſures of the Church he be</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I begin with the firſt; That an external Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Profeſſion in grown and adult perſons is to be made by themſelves; Thus it was at the firſt erection of the Chriſtian Church, when Perſons by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Miracles of the Apoſtles were converted from the <hi>Pagan</hi> Superſtition and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith; they were to believe, and with the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 8. 27.</note> to declare their belief, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Infants and Children not grown up to years of diſcretion, by their Parents, and thoſe who at the requeſt of their Parents, do together with them undertake for them. So great an intereſt and propriety have Parents in their Children, ſo intire an affection and concern for their good and happineſs, ſo unqueſtionable an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them, ſo binding and obligatory are all their reaſonable commands upon them, that we have good grounds to believe, that they that are born of Chriſtian Parents will be brought up in the Chriſtian Religion, and at years of underſtanding take upon themſelves what their Parents and Sureties promis'd for them; and upon this account that profeſſion of Faith made by others at their Baptiſm, in their behalf, may in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſenſe be reckon'd, as made by themſelves; ſo God accounted it in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Parents being in covenant with God,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:130"/> were the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> eſteem'd an holy Seed, and at eight days old admitted by Circumciſion into the ſame Church and Covenant with them; And the ſame reaſon holds for admitting Children born of Chriſtian Parents into the Chriſtian Church by the Rite of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which is the Sign and Seal of the Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, as Circumciſion was of that under the Law. Now that this external profeſſion, without any farther ſigns of ſaving Grace, is ground ſufficient for thoſe with whom God hath entruſted the Keys and Government of his Church to admit perſons into it, will appear from theſe particulars:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This is the qualification preſcrib'd by our Lord: he is the Head and Founder of his Church, to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does it appertain to appoint the terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of admiſſion into it, and what theſe are, we may learn from that commiſſion he gave his Apoſtles when he ſent them out to gather a Church under him, <hi>viz.</hi> the becoming his Diſciples; <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Teach all</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Diſciple all <hi>Nations;</hi> Now a Diſciple is properly one, not that has already attain'd to the full <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> knowledg and ſaving effects of the Goſpel, but only underſtands ſo much of it, as to be willing to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Chriſtian Church, in order to his being far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught the one, and to have the other more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought in him. Whether men are ſincere in their profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, and in their deſires to be admitted Members of Chriſt's Church, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this great Priviledg and Bleſſing of Church-memberſhip will be effectual, to produce in them that regeneration and new creature, for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, the Paſtors and Governours of the Church
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:130"/> cannot know; This their bare profeſſion and deſire is enough to give them a title to it and qualification for it. By this rule the Apoſtles of Chriſt walkt as to this particular, even when they liv'd with him here on Earth, and were under his immediate direction: <hi>The Phariſees heard that Jeſus made and Baptiz'd more Diſciples than</hi> John, <hi>tho' Jeſus himſelf did not Baptize,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">John 4. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>but his Diſciples.</hi> Now if, as it was fam'd abroad, and is not in the Text contradicted, Jeſus's Diſciples Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd more than <hi>John,</hi> it follows that they baptiz'd more than were ſincere, when we read that ſo few, not above an Hundred and Twenty continued with Chriſt to the laſt. <note place="margin">Acts 1. 15.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. It appears from the Apoſtles practice afterwards in admitting perſons into the Church. Nothing but a profeſs'd willingneſs to receive the Goſpel, tho they receiv'd it not from the heart, was requir'd by them, in order to it: The Text tells us, <hi>that they that gladly receiv'd St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s words were baptiz'd, and the ſame</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 2. 41.</note> 
                           <hi>day were added to the Church about</hi> 3000 <hi>ſouls;</hi> It's true, St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted them all to repent in order to it, but whether they did ſo or no, he ſtay'd not for proof, from their bringing forth fruits worthy of repentance, but preſently upon their profeſt willing reception of the Word they were baptiz'd and added to the Church. One might have been apt to ſuſpect, that amongſt ſo great a number, all would not prove ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Converts, and ſo it fell out; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 4. 34. Acts 5. 1, 2, 3.</note> were two of the number, in whom ye know, that glad reception of the Goſpel was found to be but groſs hypocriſie. By the ſame rule St. <hi>Philip</hi> proceeded in planting the Church at <hi>Samaria; when the People ſeeing the miracles he did, gave heed to the doctrine he</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts 8. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>taught, concerning the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Name of Jeſus,</hi> and declar'd their belief of it, without
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:131"/> any farther examination <hi>they were Baptized both Men and Women:</hi> And amongſt them was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> woſe former notorious Crimes of Sorcery, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and Blaſphemy, might have given juſt grounds of fear to the holy Deacon, that his Faith was but hypocritical, and his Heart not right in the ſight of God, as appear'd afterwards, yet upon his believing, <note place="margin">Acts 8. 20.</note> he was Baptiz'd; ſuch other Members of Chriſt's Church were <hi>Demas, Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> they <note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> had nothing, it ſeems, but a bare outward profeſſion of the Faith, to entitle them to that Priviledg, ſince afterwards, as we read, the one embrac'd this preſent World, and the other two made ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This appears from the repreſentation Chriſt hath <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10. 1 Tim. 1. 19.</note> made of his Church in the Goſpel, fore-inſtructing his Diſciples by many Parables, that it ſhould conſiſt of a mixture of good and bad. It is a Field wherein Wheat and Tares grow up together; A Net wherein are Fiſhes of all ſorts; A Flour in which is laid up ſolid Corn and <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 24, 25. verſ. 47.</note> light Chaff; A Vine on which are fruitful and barren Branches; A great Houſe wherein are Veſſels of Gold <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 12.</note> and Silver, and Veſſels of leſſer value, Wood and Earth; <note place="margin">John 15. 1.</note> A Marriage feaſt, where are wiſe and fooliſh Virgins, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 20.</note> ſome with wedding garments, and ſome without, ſome <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> had Oyl, and ſome but empty Lamps; St. <hi>Hierome</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, wherein were preſerv'd Beaſts clean and unclean; when the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>They are</hi>

                           <hi>not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael, his meaning was, that in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church many more were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in the Fleſh, than what were Circumcis'd in Heart; and when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>many are call'd,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>but few choſen,</hi> he declar'd the ſame thing, that in his Church many more were call'd and admitted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:131"/> into it by Baptiſm, than what were ſanctified by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or ſhould be admitted into his Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The many corrupt and vicious Members in the Churches, which the Apoſtle themſelves had planted, is another proof of this; The number whereof, in all likelihood, could not have been ſo great, had they been ſo cautious and ſcrupulous, as to admit none into them, but whom in their judgments they thought to be really holy. In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> there were <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 34. ver. 12. 2 Cor. 12. 20, 21. 1 Cor. 7.</note> many, that had not the knowledg of God, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Reſurrection of the Dead, that came Drunk to the Lords Table, that were Fornicators, Unclean and Contentious Perſons. In the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> there were many that Nauſeated the Bread of Life, and made it their Choice, to pick and eat the rubbiſh of the partition wall, which Chriſt had demoliſht; The Rites of the Law which expired at the death of Chriſt, they attempted to pull out of their Graves, and to give a Reſurrection to them; They were ſo much gone off from the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, to weak and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Rudiments, obſerving Days and Months, and <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 7; 10, 11.</note> Times and Years; that by reaſon of this their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſignifi'd his fears of quite loſing them, and that his labour was beſtowed upon them in vain.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt all the Seven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> there was not one but what had receiv'd ſuch Members into it, that were either very Cold &amp; Lukewarm in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or by their Vicious Lives proved a Reproach and Scandal to it; The Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> ſo ſwarm'd with theſe, that St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that there were but <hi>a few</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 1, 4.</note> 
                           <hi>names in</hi> Sardis <hi>that had not defil'd their garments.</hi> Now if the Apoſtles of our Lord, who had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtances of the Holy Ghoſt, for the diſcerning of Spirits at that time, and were thereby
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:132"/> enabl'd far beyond what any of their Succeſſors can pretend to, to diſtinguiſh betwixt the good and the bad, did notwiſtanding admit many meer formal Profeſſors into the Church of Chriſt, we may conclude that they apprehended that 'twas the will of Chriſt it ſhould be ſo.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. No other rule in admitting perſons into the Church is practicable. Whether Perſons are really holy and truly regenerate or no, the Officers of Chriſt who know not the hearts of Men, cannot make a certain judgment of, they may through want of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be deceiv'd, through the ſubtilty of hypocrites be impos'd upon, through humane frailty, paſſion or prejudice, be miſguided, and by this means, many times, the door may be open'd to the bad, and ſhut againſt the good; Now that cannot be ſuppos'd to be a rule of Chriſt's appointment, which is either impoſſible to be obſerv'd, or in obſerving which, the Governours of his Church cannot be ſecur'd from acting wrongfully and injuriouſly to Men.</p>
                        <p>In ſum, Chriſt hath entruſted the power of the Keys into the hands of an Order of Men whom he hath ſet over his Church, and who, under him, are to manage the Affairs of it, but theſe being but <hi>Earthen veſſels,</hi> of ſhort and fallible underſtandings, he has <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4 7.</note> not left the execution of their Office to be manag'd ſolely by their own prudence and diſcretion, but hath given them a certain publick Rule to go by, both in admitting perſons into his Church, and in excluding them out of it; for the one, the Rule is, open and ſolemn profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith; for the other, open and ſcandalous Offences, prov'd by witneſſes.</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:132"/>
                        <p>2. The ſecond Propoſition is, <hi>That every ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has a right to all the external Priviledges of the Church, till by his continuance in ſome notorious and ſcandalous ſins he forfeits that right, and by the juſt cenſures of the Church for ſuch behaviour he be actually excluded from thoſe Priviledges.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the explanation and proof of this Propoſition, theſe three particulars are to be done: (1.) What's meant by external Priviledges? (2) What kind of Offenders thoſe are that forfeit their right to them, and ought by the Cenſures of the Church to be excluded from them? (3.) Upon what the right of thoſe Members that have not ſo offended, is grounded?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What's meant by external Priviledges? As there are two ſorts of Members in Chriſt's viſible Church, ſo there are two ſorts of Priviledges that belong to them; each ſort having thoſe that are proper and peculiar to it, according to the nature of that relation they bear to the Head and their fellow Members.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There are Members only by <hi>foederal</hi> or covenant-holineſs, ſuch as are only <hi>born of water,</hi> when by Baptiſm they were united to Chriſt and the Church, and took upon them the Profeſſion and Practice of the Chriſtian Religion; Now the Priviledges that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to theſe are of the ſame make with their Church-memberſhip, external, and conſiſting only in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and publick Communion with the Church in the Word and Ordinances.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There are Members by real and inherent holineſs, ſuch as are not <hi>only born of Water, but of the Spirit</hi> alſo, when by the inward operations of the Holy Ghoſt their Souls are renew'd after the Image of God, and made partakers of a Divine Nature; And the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:133"/> Priviledges that belong to theſe, are not only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ones, but together with them, others that are ſutable to their more ſpiritual relation, inward, and ſuch as conſiſt in the eſpecial and particular care and protection of God, the pardon and remiſſion of their ſins by the Blood of Chriſt, and the gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and comforts of the Holy Ghoſt; All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that Prayer of the Apoſtle for his <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt, be</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>with you all. Amen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now tis of the firſt ſort of Members, and that ſort of Priviledges that belong to them, that the Propoſition is to be underſtood.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What kind of Offenders thoſe are that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their right to, and ought by the Cenſures of the Church to be excluded from thoſe Priviledges? This the Apoſtle hath plainly told us, and our own Church in its Exhortation to the Sacrament fairly intimates: <hi>I have wrote unto you,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, not no keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>if any Man that is call'd a Brother be a Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an Extortioner, no, not to eat?</hi> Not only, as much as can be, to have no familier converſation with <note place="margin">ver. 10.</note> him in civil matters (tho' ſome muſt be had whilſt we are in this World) but alſo, and more eſpecially, to avoid communion with him in religious exerciſes; and how that is to be done, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>viz.</hi> not by forſaking the Church our ſelves, but by doing our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to have him caſt out of it: So it follows, <hi>Therefore put away from among your ſelves that wicked</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>perſon.</hi> And, <hi>In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch an one</hi>

                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:133"/> 
                           <hi>may bo ſav'd in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Agreeable hereunto are the words of the Exhortation, <hi>If any of you be a blaſphemer of God, a hinderer and ſlanderer of his Word, an Adulterer, or be in malice or envy, or in any other greivous Crime, repent you of your ſins, or come not to that holy Table.</hi> Such ſinners as theſe have in a manner undone and made void what was done in their behalf in Baptiſm; They, by not performing what was then promis'd for them, but living directly contrary to it, do virtually renounce that Covenant they then entred into with God in Chriſt, and fall back again into the ſtate of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> Their Sureties engag'd for them, that they ſhould believe the Chriſtian Faith, keep God's Commandments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil; But ſuch habitual notorious Offenders as theſe, ſay, by their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, what had they to do to undertake ſuch things for us, we will ſtand to no ſuch engagements, but we will be at large, to believe what we pleaſe, and to practice what we fancy, and to worſhip whom we think fit; And thus, as it were, breaking off from being in Covenant with God, and virtually renouncing their Church-memberſhip, they at the ſame time loſe all right and title to thoſe Bleſſings and Priviledges that were due to them upon the account thereof; and in this ſad ſtate and condition did the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians reckon all, that had h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ouſly ſinn'd, amongſt whom eſpecially were the lapſed that had offer'd Sacrifice, they ſtaid not for a formal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be pronounc'd againſt them by the Church, but lookt upon them as <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate; and tho' till that was paſt, they could not actually be ſhut out, yet they began before to avoid their Company, and to forbear all religious commerce towards them. But ſo long as Men keep in Covenant with God, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:134"/> abide in his Church, which may be done by holding that profeſſion of Faith that they made at their firſt entrance into it, their right to the external franchiſes of it remains inviolable, and their title without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. As may appear from theſe particulars,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the Tenour of that Covenant they in their Baptiſm enter'd into with God; which conſiſts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes on God's part, as well as Conditions on Mans. The Promiſes on God's part, are expreſt in theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 61.</note> words, <hi>I will be their God;</hi> The Conditions on Mans, in thoſe, <hi>and they ſhall be my People:</hi> Now ſo far as Men perform the Conditions, ſo far will God make good his Promiſes; In what ſenſe they are a People to God, in the ſame he'll be a God unto them. If a bare <hi>faederal</hi> holineſs can give Men a relation to God, and God upon that account owns them to be a People unto him, the ſame gives them ſome kind of intereſt in God; and a claim to the bleſſings that belong to that relation; Not, that ſuch Members as theſe are to expect thoſe ſpecial and particular favours, that are the portion of thoſe that are more nearly, and by a kind of ſpiritual conſanguinity allied to God in Chriſt, but yet being of God's houſhould, are to be allowed the liberty to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of thoſe external bleſſings which he in common beſtows upon the whole Family.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From the nature of Church-memberſhip. Church-memberſhip neceſſarily implies Church-Communion, or elſe it ſignifies nothing; for to be admitted a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, and not to have a right in common with the reſt to Church-Priviledges, is to be taken in with one hand, and to be thrown out with the other, 'tis to be put back into the ſtate of thoſe that are no Members, and virtually to be cut off from the Body, by being denied all communications with it; Should a Man be admitted a Member of any City or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:134"/> and yet at the ſame time be denied the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Freedom, and not be permitted to ſet up a Trade, to give a Vote, or to Act in any other caſe, as other Members do, what would be the difference betwixt him and a Foreigner? unleſs it be, that his condition is the worſe, by being mock'd, and abus'd and cheated with the Name, whilſt he has nothing of the Priviledges of a Freeman.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We have the Practice of the Church of God in the Old Teſtament for this; The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not only permitted, but commanded by God, except in caſes of legal uncleanneſs, and thoſe notorious Crimes for which they were to be caſt out of the Congregation, to obſerve his Ordinances, and to joyn in the celebration of his publick Worſhip, <hi>and we know they were not all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that were of</hi> Iſrael; Three times a year were <hi>all their Males to appear before the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 14, 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Lord, to keep Three ſolemn appointed Feaſts unto him;</hi> many of which, it is to be fear'd, had no other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, than what they were beholden to their birth, and the loſs of their fore-skin for; Again, All the <hi>Congregation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were too keep the Paſſover,</hi> none <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 44.</note> were denied it <hi>but foreigners and hired ſervants,</hi> and they too, no longer, but till they were Circumcis'd, and thereby admitted into covenant with God, which ſhews, that meer Circumciſion was enough to put a Man into a capacity of Communicating with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in its moſt ſolemn and ſacred Myſteries.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This was alſo the Practice of the Chriſtian Church in the Apoſtolick Age; as is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated unto us from many Scriptures; St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>By one Spirit we are all Baptiz'd into one Body, whether</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles, <hi>bond or free, and have been all made</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>to drink into one Spirit. To drink into one Spirit,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly relates to the Cup in the Lord's Supper, and by a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:135"/> figure of the part for the whole, it's put to ſignifie the whole Communion; but the thing here eſpecially to be taken notice of, is, that the Apoſtle makes the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that receiv'd the Lord's Supper to be as comprehenſive and univerſal, as that of thoſe that were receiv'd into the Church by Baptiſm; <hi>As by one Spirit</hi> all <hi>were baptized into one body, ſo</hi> all <hi>were made to drink into one ſpirit.</hi> The Apoſtles ſpeaks the ſame thing again in another place, alluding to the other part of the Sacrament, <hi>We being many, are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of one bread;</hi> all the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 17.</note> members that conſpired to make up the one body, did partake of the one bread; But if any thing yet can be clearer, 'tis that account St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us of the practice of the firſt Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where it's ſaid of the three thouſand that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, and were by Baptiſm added to the Church, <hi>they,</hi> all the three thouſand, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> being of the number, <hi>continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. From the end of Church-memberſhip; which is not only for the more ſolemn Worſhip of God, and the publick profeſſion of Religion, but alſo for the more effectual edification and ſalvation of mens ſouls; By Baptiſm we were admitted into the Church, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into that Divine Society, and entitled to all the Priviledges of the Goſpel, to the end, <hi>that in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the faith, and the knowledg of the Son of God,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>we might come to a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi> But how this is to be attain'd without being admitted to all the Acts and Offices of Communion with the Church, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Prayers and Sacraments and the Word, and all other Priviledges and Duties, is not eaſily to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:135"/> be underſtood; hence, we may obſerve, that edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture is uſually applied to the Church, and tho, the edification of the Church conſiſts in the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the particular Members of it, yet becauſe that is not to be had but in the Unity and Communion of the Church, 'tis uſually ſtiled, the <hi>edifying of the</hi>

And indeed, I do not know any more forceable Arguments to an Holy Life, than what are therein repreſented to us: What can more work upon ingenuous ſpirits, than the diſcovery of ſuch undeſerv'd love and kindneſs? Is it not enough to melt the moſt frozen heart into Floods of Tears and Joy, to behold therein the Bleſſed Jeſus ſhedding his Blood to reconcile ſinners unto God; What can more powerfully

How accurſed a thing is ſin, will the conſidering Communicant ſay, that the bleſſed Jeſus, who did but take ſin upon him, was made a Curſe for it! What a mighty evil muſt ſin needs be, when nothing could be ſufficient to expiate it, but the Blood of God! What an unſpeakable malignity muſt ſin have in it, when it laid on the ſhouldiers of Omnipotency ſuch a load of wrath, as made him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and ſweat, and grone and die! Again, Here we repeat our Baptiſmal Vow to God, ſolemnly engage our ſelves afreſh to be his faithful ſervants, and bind our ſelves by a new Oath, to be true to the Covenant we have made with him, and certainly that Man muſt have a mighty love for Sin and Death, that can break through all theſe Bonds and Obligations to come at it.</p>

                           <p>Obj. But were not the pollutions of ſin typified by <note place="margin">Numb. 19, 13, 20.</note> the legal uncleanneſſes? And was not every thing that the unclean perſon touch'd, made unclean?</p>

                           <p>2. Thoſe legal pollutions did not defile the whole Communion, but only thoſe particular perſons whom the unclean perſon touch'd, for (1.)

                           <p>3. When it's ſaid that the unclean perſon, that did not purifie himſelf, <hi>defiled the Tabernacle and polluted the Sanctuary,</hi> the meaning is, that he did ſo to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but not to others; ſo does a wicked man, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, in reſpect of himſelf, but not of others: The Prayers of the wicked, tho' joyn'd with thoſe of the Church, are an abomination unto God, whilſt at the ſame time the Prayers of good men go up as a ſweet ſmelling ſavour and are accepted by him; The perſon that comes unworthily to the Sacrament of the

                           <p n="1">1. What was the occaſion of this Apoſtolical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. To this purpoſe you muſt know that the converted <hi>Corinthians</hi> liv'd in civil Society amongſt the unbelieving <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by whom many of them being their kinsfolk and friends after the fleſh, were often invited to their Idol-feaſts, to which ſome of them <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 27.</note> did not ſcruple to go and eat of the things ſacrific'd to Idols, even in the Idol's Temple, thinking it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 10.</note> to do ſo, ſo long as they knew that an Idol was nothing, and did not intentionally go and eat in any honour to the Idol. Now from this Practice the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> Apoſtle diſſuades them by theſe two Arguments; (1.) Upon the account of ſcandal to their weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, telling them that tho' they that were ſtrong, knew that an Idol was nothing in the World, and that there was but one God, and ſo could not be ſuppos'd to worſhip the Idol when they eat of the Idol's ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; yet ſome other weak Chriſtians and new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts might not know ſo much, and conſequently by their practice might be drawn into ſin, not only to go to thoſe Feaſts, but to do it in honour to the Idol.

But, bleſſed be <note place="margin">ver. 20.</note> God, we have not the like occaſion for ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, we live not in a civil ſociety with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, but under a Chriſtian Prince, and with a People profeſſing the Chriſtian Religion; Here are no publick Idols ſet up, nor any Feaſts kept in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them; had the Caſe been thus with us, we had been as much concern'd in the Text as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, but being far otherwiſe, not the leaſt aid can be fetcht from hence, to defend Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from our Publick Aſſemblies.</p>

                           <p>A Church that needs no counterfeit Legends, no incredible Miracles, no ridiculous Fables to promote her veneration, whoſe ſecurity lies not in the Peoples ignorance, but in their inlightned underſtandings, that can defend it ſelf without the help of ſpurious Authors, or corrupting the words and ſenſe of Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ones, a Church that dares to be underſtood, and is ſure, the more ſhe's lookt into, the more to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd and admir'd.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>BEfore I proceed to the Caſe it ſelf, it will be fit to conſider what the things are which the Queſtion more immediately reſpects. For the better underſtanding of which, we may obſerve.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there are Eſſential parts of Divine Worſhip, and which are, either by Nature or Revelation, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that they are in all Ages neceſſary: In Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, ſuch are the Objects of it, which muſt be Divine; ſuch are the acknowledgment of Honour, and Reverence, due and peculiar to thoſe Objects, as Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the Chriſtian Religion, ſuch are the Sacraments of Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper. Theſe are always to be the ſame in the Church.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There are other things relating to Divine Worſhip, which are arbitrary and variable, and determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Circumſtances, as Geſture, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:150"/>
                        <p>As to the former i'ts granted by the contending Parties, that they are all already preſcribed, and that nothing in that kind can be added to what is already preſcribed, nor can any thing ſo preſcribed be altered, or aboliſhed. Nothing now can be made neceſſary and binding to all Perſons, Places, and Ages, that was not ſo from the beginning of Chriſtianity; and nothing that was once made ſo by Divine Authority can be rendred void or unneceſſary by any other.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Queſtion is to be applied to the latter, and then i'ts no other than, <hi>Whether things in their own nature Indifferent, though not preſcribed in the Word of God, may be lawfully uſed in Divine Worſhip?</hi> Or, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any thing Indifferent in the Worſhip of God?</hi>

                           <item>Thirdly, Neither Duty nor Sin.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Duty is either ſo Morally, and in its own Nature, or made ſo by Divine and Poſitive Command. Sin is ſo in its own Nature, or made and declared to be ſuch by Divine and Poſitive Prohibition. Neither Duty nor Sin, is that which no Law, either of Nature or Revelation, hath determined; and is uſually known by the Name of <hi>Indifferent,</hi> that is, it's of a middle Nature, partaking in it ſelf of neither extremes, and may be indifferently uſed or forborn, as in Reaſon and Prudence ſhall be thought meet. Things of this kind the Apoſtle calls <hi>Lawfal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they are the ſubject of no Law, and what are therefore Lawful to us, and which without Sin we may either chuſe or refuſe. Thus the Apoſtle doth determine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> that is, it can be no tranſgreſſion to omit that which the Law doth not in-joyn, nor to do that which it doth not forbid; for elſe that would be a Duty which the Law doth not in-joyn, and that would be a Sin which it doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid; which is in effect to ſay there is a Law where there is none, or that Duty and Sin are ſo without reſpect to any Law. But now if Duty be Duty becauſe it's in-joyned, and Sin be Sin becauſe its fordidden, then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different is Indifferent becauſe its neither injoyed nor forbidden. For as to make it a Duty there needs a Command, and to make it a Sin there needs a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo where there is neither Command nor Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its neither Duty nor Sin, and muſt be therefore Indifferent, Lawful, and Free. So that we may as well know by the Silence of the Law, what is Indifferent, as we may know by its Authority, what is a Duty or a Sin. And I have no more Reaſon to think that a Duty or a Sin which it takes no notice of (ſince all Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſeth from a Law) than that not to be a Duty or a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:151"/> Sin which it doth: The Nature of Lawful things being as much determined ſo to be, by the want of ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as that of Neceſſary is determined by it: And he that ſhall ſay that's a Duty or a Sin which is not ſo made and declared by any Law, may as well ſay that's no Duty or Sin which there is a Law about. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there muſt be a Law to make it a Tranſgreſſion, and the want of a Law doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe it to be none, and what there is no Law for or againſt, remains Indifferent in it ſelf, and Lawful to us. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe there ſhould be a Diſpute concerning Days ſet apart for the Service and Worſhip of God, how muſt this be determined but by the Law of Nature or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and how ſhall we be reſolved in the caſe, but by conſidering what the Law injoyns or forbids in it? If we find it not injoyned, it can be of it ſelf no Duty; if we find it not forbidden, it can be of it ſelf no Sin; and conſequently it's Lawful and Indifferent, and in what we neither Sin by omitting nor obſerving. So the Apoſtle concludes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>He that regardeth a day, regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the day, unto the Lord he doth not regard it;</hi> that is, there was no Law requiring it, and ſo making the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it Neceſſary; and no Law forbidding it, and ſo making the obſervation of it Sinful; and therefore Chriſtians were at Liberty to obſerve, or not to obſerve it as they pleaſed; and in both they did well, if ſo be they had a <hi>regard to the Lord</hi> in it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>I ſhall ſhew that there are things Indifferent in the Worſhip of God, and that ſuch things, though not preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be lawfully uſed in it.</hi> Tis allowed by all, that there is no Command to be expected about the Natural Circumſtances of Action, and which the Service can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be celebrated without, ſuch as Time and Place,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:151"/> and that theſe are left to humane Prudence to fix and determine. But what thoſe Natural Circumſtances are is not ſo univerſally agreed to. And if they be ſuch as aforeſaid, that is, <hi>ſuch as the action cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without,</hi> then it will very much ſerve to juſtify moſt of the things in diſpute, and defend our Church in the uſe and practice of them. For what is there almoſt in that kind amongſt us, which is not Naturally or Morally neceſſary to the Action, and if Time and Place fall under humane determination, becauſe they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally neceſſary, then why not alſo Geſture and Habit, which Worſhip can no more Naturally be celebrated without, than the former; and conſequently a Surplice, or Kneeling and Standing may be alike lawfully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and uſed, as Time for aſſembling together, and a Church to aſſemble and Officiate in. And what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Circumſtances are to a Natural Action, that are Moral Circumſtances to a Moral Action; and there are Moral as neceſſary to a Moral Action, as there are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſary to a Natural Action. As for example, what Time and Place are to Natural, that are Method and Order to Moral and Religious Acts, and can no more be ſeparated from theſe than the other can be ſeparated from the former, and therefore the Method and Order of Adminiſtration in Divine Worſhip (where not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined and appointed by God) may as well be determined by Men, as Time and Place, with reſpect to the nature, end, and uſe of the Service. So that the exception made againſt humane Appointments in Divine Worſhip, <hi>viz. (that all but natural circumſtances muſt have a Divine Command to legitimate their uſe;</hi> and that <hi>whatever is not preſcribed, is therefore prohibited)</hi> is of no ſervice to them that plead it; and it remains good ſo far notwithſtanding, that there are things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the Worſhip of God, and that the outward
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:152"/> Order and Adminiſtration of it is left to Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; And this I ſhall more particularly prove.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the conſideration of the Rules laid down in the Goſpel, relating to the Adminiſtration of Divine Worſhip which (except what refer to the Elements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Sacraments) are taken from the Nature of the thing; and ſo always were obliging to all Ages under the ſeveral variations and forms of Divine Worſhip, and will be always ſo to all Chriſtians in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as reſpect <hi>Order, Decency</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> inſiſted upon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26, 40. So that we are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bound, than as bound by theſe meaſures, and where not bound by them vve are free. For as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages from the beginning of the World, vvhere Revelation did not interpoſe (as it did under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Diſpenſation) all perſons vvere left at liberty, and if ſo be they had a reſpect to thoſe natural rules, might chooſe vvhat vvays they pleaſed for the regulation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip: So vvhen under the Goſpel vve have no other than thoſe Natural rules (except as above excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the particular Circumſtrnces are as much novv the matter of our free choice, as they vvere then, and this or that may be uſed and obſerved, as the Caſe requireth and Occaſion ſerves. So that if ever there vvere things Indifferent in Gods Worſhip, and the Adminiſtration of it was left to the Conſideration and Prudence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it is ſo ſtill, ſince the Goſpel keeps to thoſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rules, which even the Nature of the Thing hath invariably eſtabliſhed, and which, if it ever was ſufficient for the guiding of the Church of God in thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, is certainly ſo when the Nature of Man is improved by new helps, and ſo he is more capable of judging what may be ſutable to that Eſſential VVorſhip which God hath preſcribed under the Goſpel, and to Him whom that VVorſhip is directed to. But then that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:152"/> this, is, that thoſe Rules are alſo general; and ſuch as will in their uſe and end reſpect all People in the VVorld. The Apoſtles in all their Diſcourſes upon this ſubject rarely do deſcend to particulars, and in what they do, ſhew how far Cuſtom and Charity, and the Reaſon of the thing ought to govern us; as in the caſe of mens being Uncovered in the VVorſhip of God, for which the Apoſtle doth argue not from Inſtitution, but the Nature and Decency of it, being in token of their preheminence, and the headſhip they have over the VVoman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 47. But otherwiſe they without doubt thought it unpracticable to tye all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions up to the ſame Modes and Circumſtances, or if practicable, that it was not worth the while, when the VVorſhip might as well be Adminiſtred, and God as much Honoured by one as the other. Now if they did think it ſufficient to preſcribe only in this General way, it muſt needs be that the particulars of thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals muſt be Indifferent, and that the chuſing of one particular before the other was left to Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And if it ſhould be ſaid (as it is) that <hi>when the things are determined in general, the particulars are therein alſo vertually determined,</hi> and ſo are not Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; I ſhall content my ſelf to reply, that by this way of arguing there would be nothing Indifferent in the VVorld: There being nothing, how Lawful and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſoever in it ſelf, but what we are limited by General Rules in the uſe of. As for example, all Meats are now Lawful to Chriſtians, but yet there are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules by which we are determined in the uſe of them, ſuch as our own Conſtitution, and our Quality, or Scandal given to others: But the being thus bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch Rules, doth not change the Nature of thoſe Meats, and make them to be other than Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. So it is in the VVorſhip of God, for the better
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:153"/> Adminiſtration of which there are general Rules laid down; and according to which we are to be determined in our choice of particulars, but yet the particulars not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are Indifferent and matter of Chriſtian Liberty, and what humane prudence is to regulate us in.</p>
                        <p>All which will yet be further confirmed by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of the things which are the Subject of thoſe general Rules, <hi>viz. Order, Decency,</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> which do moſtly, if not altogether, depend upon vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Circumſtances, and may be different according to thoſe Circumſtances; ſometimes this, and at other times that being ſubſervient thereunto. As for inſtance, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency doth generally depend upon Cuſtom, and the Cuſtom of Ages and Countries being different, Decency in one Age or Country may be and often is quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what it is in another. It was once comely amougſt ſome Nations to be covered in Divine Worſhip, and practiſed both amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Synagogues, as the Apoſtle doth inſinuate, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14. and their own Authors do acknowledg <note n="(a)" place="margin">Lightf. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Romans.</hi> But it was <hi>Comely</hi> amongſt others to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, as amongſt the <hi>Grecians, (c)</hi> who in thoſe Times giving Laws of Civility, and in many things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion too to other Nations, it became a prevailing Cuſtom, and was, as a thing decent, introduced into <note place="margin">
                              <hi>(b)</hi> Macrob. Saturn. l. 3. c. 6.</note> the Chriſtian Church. Thus it is alſo as to <hi>Edification,</hi> which doth in like manner often depend upon Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and according to thoſe Circumſtances the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the Church in its Peace, Union, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort may be promoted or hindred, and that may be for Edification in one Age or Church, which is not ſo in another.</p>
                        <p>Thus the being covered in Divine Worſhip was for Edification in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, being uſed in token
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:153"/> of Eear and Reverence, Diſtance and Subjection; in alluſion to which the <hi>Seraphims</hi> are repreſented appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God, after that manner, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. 2. and in imitation of whom the Apoſtle pleads that Woman ſhould be vailed in Religious Aſſemblies, in token of Subjection and Shamefacedneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. But on the contrary he doth judge and Determin that, for the Reaſons above given, it was better and more for Edification, that Men ſhould be therein Uncovered. So the <hi>Love-feaſts,</hi> and <hi>Holy-kiſs</hi> of Charity were at the firſt thought good for Edification, and were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in Apoſtolical times, (being an Excellent and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. and Theophyl. in 1 Cor. 11. 17. Tertul. Apol. c. 39. de orat. l. 6.</note> Admirable and Frindly, Cuſtom) as thereby was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Univerſal Love and Charity that Chriſtians ought to maintain, and which they ſhould at all times but eſpecially in Divine Worſhip be forward to expreſs and renew: But when Diſorder and Licentiouſneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from them, they were generally laid aſide, and <note place="margin">Concil. Laod. c. 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> Aboliſhed by Authority.</p>
                        <p>So it was thought to be for Edification in the Primitive Church, to Adminiſter Baptiſm by immerſion or dipping, and the Apoſtle doth make uſe of it as an excellent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to newneſs of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſignification of it, and the practiſe of the Church for a long time, a Charitable reaſon hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled it, and brought in Sprinkling inſtead of it. Thus ſitting at the Lords Supper is accounted decent by ſome, and Edification, as it's a table poſture and is a ſign of our being feaſted by God; and yet in a general Synod of the Reformed Churches in <hi>Poland,</hi> &amp;c. it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>foraſmuch as ſitting was introduced firſt by the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Synod. Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cav. concluſ. 4.

                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:154"/> 
                           <hi>Devout, and to many very offenſive.</hi> So that Order, Decency, and Edification, being generally mutable things, and varying as circumſtances vary, there could in the nature of the thing be only general Rules preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and ſo the particulars muſt be left to diſcretion, and to be determined by thoſe that are beſt able and have Authority to judge of the circumſtances, and to pick out of them thoſe which are indifferent, what may beſt ſerve the ends of Religion, and the honour of its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I ſhall prove that <hi>things indifferent in themſelves, though not preſcribed, may be Lawfully uſed in Divine Worſhip,</hi> from the practice of our Saviour and his Apoſtles. Under the Law the Conſtitution was very exact, the Rites and Orders of it very particular, and the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them punctually required. But as it was not ſo preciſe, but that many things reſpecting the outward Order were added, ſo ſome things were altered upon prudential conſiderations; and by the addition or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of which the Authority of that Law was not conceived to be infringed, nor violated; as it's evident from the reſpect which our Saviour ſhewed to them, and his compliance with them. An inſtance of this is the Synagogual Worſhip; It's a controverſie whether there was any proviſion made under the Law for the places themſelves, the intimations of that are (if any) very obſcure, but there are not ſo much as any intimations of the manner and order or parts of the VVorſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be obſerved; and yet we find ſuch there was, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21. Moſes <hi>being read and preached there every Sabbath Day;</hi> and that our Saviour frequently reſorted to it and bore a part in it, <hi>John</hi> 18. 20, &amp;c. The like temper we find him of, when he uſed the Cup of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty after the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Paſſover, though there was no inſtitution for it; and that it was as many
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:154"/> other things, taken up and uſed amongſt them by way of ſignification, and as a Teſtimony of entire Friendſhip, and Charity, <hi>Luke,</hi> 22. 16. But I conceive alteration of Circumſtances in the Inſtitution is much more excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable than the addition of ſuch to it, and yet this was both done by them and obſerved by our Saviour, when there was nothing elſe to oblige him, but only a condeſcenſion to them in ſuch uſages and rites as were inoffenſive in themſelves, and what were then generally uſed in the Church. That the poſture firſt required and uſed in the Paſiover was ſtanding, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, being to be eat with Staves in their Hands and Shoes on their Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do prove, and is affirmed by <note place="margin">Philo de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crif. Able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lightf. Hor. Matth. c. 26. 20.</note> the <hi>Jews;</hi> and it is as manifeſt that the <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of our Saviour, and for a long time before, did recede from it, and did eat it in the poſture of diſcumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; whether it was as they looked upon themſelves as ſettled in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which they were at the firſt inſtitution Travelling toward; or, as it's ſaid by the latter <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>a ſign of Liberty, and after the manner of Kings and Great Men,</hi> is not ſo materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as it is that our Saviour did follow this Cuſtom, and complied with this practice of theirs without heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus did the Apoſtles when they obſerv'd the hours of Prayer, <hi>Acts,</hi> 3. 1. which were of humane inſtitution as well as the Prayers themſelves, (for without doubt they were publick Prayers, which were uſed in the Temple,) but though the place was, yet that ſervice was of no more Authority than what was uſed in the Synagogues. Now if the <hi>Jews</hi> did thus inſtitute and alter things relating to external Order and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, according as the caſe might require, and it was lawful for them ſo to do (as it's plain from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of our Saviour and the Apoſtles with them in it) then much more may it be ſuppoſed lawful for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:155"/> Chriſtian Church to exerciſe that liberty when they have no other than ſuch general rules for their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they had then, without ſuch particulars as they had.</p>
                        <p>And that this is no other than a certain Truth, will appear from the ſame liberty taken in Apoſtolical times in Religious Aſſemblies, when the Chriſtian Church not only complied with the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſuch Rites as they were under no Obligation, but that of Charity, to uſe, &amp; which they did uſe becauſe they were not forbidden, and ſo lawful; (as when St. <hi>Paul</hi> took upon him a Vow, <hi>Acts.</hi> 21. 26.) but alſo had ſome Obſervances of it's own, that were of a ritual nature, and as they were taken up, ſo might be laid down upon prudential conſideration. Such I account was <hi>the Waſhing the Diſciples Feet,</hi> which was done by our Saviour in token of the Humility he was to be preſident of, and would have them follow him in; and which it ſeems was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10. and for a long time after continued in a ſort in ſome Churches <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ambros. Tom. 4. l. 3. de Sacrament. c. 1.</note>. Such alſo were the <hi>Love-feaſts</hi> at the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper; and the <hi>Holy-kiſs</hi> uſed then amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if not as a conſtant attendant upon all publik Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet to be ſure at Prayer <note n="(b)" place="margin">Tertul. de orat. c. 14.</note>. Which and the like uſages, however taken up, yet were in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church no other than Indifferent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly were upon the abuſe of them (as I obſerved before) diſcarded. From all which it appears, that there was no ſuch thing as Preſcription expected before any Rite ſhould be introduced into the Church, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be lawful for Chriſtians to uſe it, but that where it was not forbidden, the Practice of the Church was to determine them; and if Preſcription had been thought neceſſary for every thing uſed in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was not Natural, then certainly our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:155"/> and his Apoſtles would never have uſed or encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others to uſe any thing that wanted ſuch Authority, and that was not of Divine Inſtitution.</p>
                        <p>Now if it ſhould be objected that theſe uſages of the <note place="margin">Ames Freſh Suit, l. 2. Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

I anſwer 1. That this doth juſtify moſt of the uſages contended for, and there would be nothing unlawful in uſing a White Garment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Divine Service, ſince that <hi>as a ſign of Royalty and Dignity</hi> was <note place="margin">Caſaub. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. 16. c. 73.</note> uſed in Civil as well as Religious caſes, and according to this Argument may therefore lawfully be uſed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, becauſe it was in Civil.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They muſt ſay that either a Civil obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, when uſed in Religious Worſhip, remains Civil, notwithſtanding it's being ſo applied, or that it's Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous whilſt ſo applied; if the former, then Kneeling or Standing in the Worſhip of God would be no acts of Adoration and not be Religious, becauſe thoſe poſtures are uſed in Civil matters; if the latter, then it muſt be granted that there may be Rites uſed in the Worſhip of God and to a Religious end, which there is no Divine Preſcription for.</p>
                        <p>Nay Thirdly, It's evident that theſe and the like were not uſed by the Chriſtians as meer Civil Rites; this I think is made evident, as to Waſhing the Feet, by a Learned Perſon <note n="(a)" place="margin">Buxtorf. Exercit. Hiſt. Sacr. Coenae</note>; and not only was the kiſs of Charity called the <hi>Holy-kiſs</hi> in Scripture, but by the Fatherrs, (notwithſtanding what is <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ames. ibid. p. 342. n.

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:156"/>
                        <p>Fourthly, If the being Civil uſages did make them which were originally ſo, to be lawful in or at Divine Worſhip, then there is nothing that is uſed out of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Civil caſes and affairs, but may be introduced into the Church; ſince if it be for that reaſon that any uſages of that kind are defended, the reaſon will as well defend all as one. And then the Hiſtrionical Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might warantably be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as the <hi>rocking of a Babe in a Cradle at night, at the Nativity time; the Harrowing of Hell at Eaſter,</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>a Maypole may be brought into the Church for Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to Dance-about and Climb upon, in ſign of their deſire to ſeek the things above; and a ſtiff Straw put into the Childs Hand, for a ſign of Fighting againſt Spiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as with a Spear;</hi> And all the abſurdities of that Nature charged injuriouſly upon our Proceedings <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ames.

                              </gap>id 1</note> would rerurn with ſucceſs upon themſelves: Since all theſe are fetched from Cuſtoms and Practices in Secular matters.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, If this be a reaſon to Defend the Uſe of Rites in the Chriſtian Church, <hi>becauſe they are uſed out of it, and in Civil caſes;</hi> then what will become of that Poſition, before ſpoken of, and generally aſſerted by thoſe who oppoſe us, that <hi>nothing is to be uſed in the Worſhip of God without Preſcription, except the Natural Circumſtances of Action;</hi> for though Civil and Natural are ſometimes coincident, yet they may be and often are Separated; for Feaſting and Salutation are Civil uſages, but are no Natural Circumſtances in Divine Worſhip, and which that cannot be performed without, And if theſe and the like were uſed in the Church, and applied and annexed to Divine Worſhip; then the reaſon upon which they were introduced and uſed doth, wherever that reaſon is, juſtify the like Practice, and we are left ſtill to chooſe and act according to the Permiſſion and Allowance that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:156"/> is given us; that is, all ſuch things that are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den are juſt matter of our Chriſtian Liberty, and there is no Sin in a Prudent exerciſe of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I ſhall further prove and ſtrengthen the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>things Indifferent, though not preſcribed, may be lawfully uſed in Divine Worſhip,</hi> from the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences attending the contrary; one of which is, that if we hold all things not commanded to be prohibited, we ſhall find no Church or Religious Society in the VVorld but are Guilty; and if the doing ſo makes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Church unlawful, there is no Church we can hold Communion with. There are ſome Churches that do maintain and uſe ſuch things as the Scripture expreſly condemns, and do lay aſide ſuch as the Scripture requires; as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in it's Worſhipping Saints and Angels, and denying the Cup to the Laity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe things make it neceſſary for thoſe to quit it's Communion that are of it, and for thoſe to avoid it that are not in it. But other Churches there are that are Guilty of no ſuch Fundamental Errors and fatal miſcarriages, and may ſo far lawfully be Communicated with. But even none of theſe are there, but what, either wittingly or unwittingly, do take the liberty of uſing what the Scripture hath no where required. It was notoriouſly ſo in the Ancient Church when ſome Cuſtoms did univerſally obtain amongſt them; as the Anniverſary Solemnities of the Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and Deſcent of the Holy-Ghoſt, the receiving of the Lords Supper Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <note n="(a)" place="margin">Aug.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:157"/> in Scripture, and if ſo, a Perſon that holds it unlawful to uſe any thing uncommanded, and to hold Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a Church ſo uſing, muſt have ſeparated from the Catholick Church, ſince (if there be Credit to be given to the Fathers ſo reporting) they all agreed in the uſe and Practice of the things above recited. And he that held all fixed Holy-Days of Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution unlawful, and all Ceremonies not inſtituted by God to be prohibited, muſt not have Worſhiped with them, who did not only thus do, but thought it unlawful, when univerſally Practiſed to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                        <p>But again, as there were ſome Rites univerſally held in eſtimation, ſo there were others that were peculiar to ſome Churches, and that were not thought to be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of that particular Communion, as when in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it was the Cuſtom to Faſt on the Saturday; and of moſt orhers to make no ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt that and other days. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Aug. Epiſt. 118.</note> In the Church of <hi>Milain</hi> they Waſhed the Feet of thoſe that were to be Baptized, but in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they uſed it not <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ambroſ. l. 3. de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. c. 1.</note>. Now if Perſons did beleive ſuch things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they could have no Communion with any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, becauſe no Church was without ſuch Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded Rites; or if they could be ſo fond as to think the Rites of their own Church to be of Divine Inſtitution, yet how could they have Communion with a Church, where the contrary Cuſtom did prevail, as in the caſes aboveſaid. And as it was then, ſo it is now with all ſtated and ſettled Churchers in the World, who do Practice againſt this Principle, and either expect not or are not able to find a Command for every thing eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed amongſt them; and that Practice with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to each other as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Milain</hi> once did, ſo in ſome Churches they receive the Lord's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:157"/> Supper Kneeling, in ſome Standing, in others Sitting. In ſome they Sprinkle the Child in Baptiſm but once, and in others thrice. Now there would be no reconciling of theſe one to another, and no poſſibility of holding Communion with them under theſe Circumſtances, or of being a Member of any Church, if we muſt have an inſtitution for every thing done in the Worſhip of God, and that we muſt joyn in nothing, which has it not. As for Inſtance, what Church is there in the World, which has not ſome form or forms of Prayer, and whoſe Service for the moſt part (generally ſpeaking) is not made up of them; eſpecially that doth not uſe them in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. But now if a Perſon holds that whatever is not preſcribed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and that forms of Prayer are no where preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then he cannot joyn with the Church ſo uſing, but while in the body of the Church by reſidence, he muſt be no Member of that Body in Communion.</p>
                        <p>Nay further, if this be true, then none muſt hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them who are of this Opinion; ſince thoſe that pretend moſt to it, and urge it as a reaſon againſt Communion with us, live in contradiction to it, and to Practice and Uſe things which they have no more Authority, nor can give more reaſon for, than we do for the things they condemn, and that is, that they are lawful, expedient, and convenient. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, let us conſider the Sacraments, in wich, if any thing, we might expect particular Preſcription, becauſe they are meer Inſtitutions; where do they find that the Baptized Perſon is neceſſarily to be Sprinkled? What Command or Example have they for it, or what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more than the reaſon of the thing taken from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience and the general Practice of the Church of God in colder Climates? And yet this is as much uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that pretend to keep exactly to the Rule
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:158"/> of Scripture, as it is amongſt us that take a liberty in things Uncommanded; but with this difference, that they do it upon the ſuppoſition of a Command, and ſo make it neceſſary, and our Church leaves it, as it is, Indifferent. Again, where do they find a Command for Sitting at the Lord's Supper, or ſo much as an Example? (For the Poſture of our Saviour is left very uncertain.) Where again do they find a Command for the neceſſary uſe of conceived Prayer, and that that, and no other, ſhould be uſed in the publick Worſhip of God? And that they muſt prove that maintain publick Forms unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Where again do they find it required that an Oath is to be taken by laying the Hand on the Goſpel and Kiſſing the Book? which is both a Natural and Inſtituted part of Worſhip, being a Solemn Invocation of God and an appeal to him, with an acknowledgment of his Omniſcience, and Omnipreſence; his Providence and Government of the World; his Truth and Juſtice to Right the Innocent and Punniſh the Guilty; all which is owned and teſtified by Kiſſing that Book that God has declared this more eſpecially in. And if we more particularly deſcend to thoſe that differ from us in this point: Where do thoſe of the Congregational way find that even Chriſtians were otherwiſe divided from Chriſtians than by place, or that they did combine into particular Churches, ſo as not to be all the while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Members of another, and might be admitted, upon removal of Place, upon the ſame terms that they were of that they removed from; or indeed that they were ſo Members of a particular as not to be Members of any or the whole Church of Chriſt, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Batipzed? VVhere do they find that Chriſtians were gathered out of Chriſtians, and did combine into a Society Excluding thoſe from it that would not make a Profeſſion of their Faith and Converſion diſtinct from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:158"/> that at Baptiſm? Where do we ever read that he that was a Miniſter of one Church was not a Miniſter all the World over, as well as he that was Baptized in one was reputed a Chriſtian and Church-Member wherever he came? Again, where do we read that its neceſſary that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould be alike in Authority, Power, and Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that there is to be no difference in point of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Superiority amongſt them: Or that there are to be Elders for Governing the Church, who are not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to it, and are in no other State after than they were before that Service, both of which are held by the Prerbyterians, ſtrictly ſo called? And if it be ſaid theſe reſpect Government but not VVorſhip; I anſwer the caſe is the ſame, for if we are to do nothing but what is preſcribed in the VVorſhip of God, becauſe, (as they ſay) it derogates from the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, and doth detract from the Sufficiency of Scripture; then I ſay upon the like reaſon, there muſt be nothing uſed in Church Government but what is preſcribed, ſince the Kingly Office is as much concerned in this as the Prieſtly in the other, and the Sufficiency of Scripture in both. Laſtly, VVhere do any of them find that poſition in Scripture, that <hi>there is nothing lawful in Divine Worſhip but what preſcribed,</hi> and that <hi>what is not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is Forbidden?</hi> And if there be no ſuch poſition in Scripture, then that can no more be true than the want of ſuch a poſition can render things not Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be unlawful.</p>
                        <p>And now I am come to that which muſt put an Iſſue one way or other to the Diſpute; for if there be no ſuch poſition in Scripture, either expreſſed in it, or to be gathered by good conſequence from it, we have gain'd the point; but if there be, then we muſt give it up. And this is indeed contended for. For its Objected,</p>
                        <p>That its accounted in Scripture an hainous Crime <label type="milestone">

                           <hi>things not Commanded are Forbidden,</hi> is not true, and ſo it cannot be the Sence and Meaning of the Phraſe; for</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Then all things muſt be either Commanded or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; and there would be nothing but what muſt be Commanded or Forbidden; but I have before ſhewed, and it muſt be granted, that there are things neither Commanded nor Forbidden, which are called Indifferent.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If things not Commanded are Forbidden, then a thing not Commanded is alike Hainous as a thing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. And then <hi>David</hi>'s Temple which he deſigned to Build would have been Criminal as well as <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> and the Feaſt of <note n="(a)" place="margin">Eſth. 9. 27.</note> 
                           <hi>Purim,</hi> like <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Eighth Month <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 King. 12. 32, 33.</note>; and the Synagogal Worſhip like the Sacrificing in Gardens <note n="(c)" place="margin">Iſai. 65. 3.</note>; and the hours of Prayer <note n="(d)" place="margin">Act. 3. 1.</note> like <hi>Nadab</hi>'s Strange Fire, The former of which were things Uncommanded, and the latter Forbidden; and yet They were approved and Theſe condemned.</p>
                        <p>2. The things, to which this Phraſe <hi>not Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> is applied, to give no encouragement to ſuch an Inference from it; for its conſtantly applied to ſuch as are abſolutely Forbidden. This was the caſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who offered Fire not meerly Uncommanded, but what was prohibited, which will appear; if we conſider that the Word <hi>Strange</hi> when applied to matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip doth ſignify as much as Forbidden. Thus we read of <hi>Strange Incenſe,</hi> that is, other than what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <note place="margin">Exod. 30. 9,</note>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:159"/> according to the directions given for it; which as it was to be put to no common uſes, ſo no common <note place="margin">Ver. 34. Ch. 37: 29.</note> perſmue was to be put to the like uſes with it. So we alſo read of <hi>Strange Vanities,</hi> which is but another <note place="margin">Jer. 8. 19.</note> Word for <hi>Graven Images;</hi> and of <hi>Strange Gods.</hi> And after the ſame ſort is it to be underſtood in the caſe before us, <hi>viz.</hi> for what is Forbidden. For that ſuch was the Fire made uſe of by thoſe Young Men will be further confirm'd, if we conſider that there is ſcarcely any thing belonging to the Altar (Setting aſide the Structure of it) of which more is ſaid than of the Fire burning upon it. For 1. It was lighted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. 24.</note>. 2. It was always to be burning upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ch. 6. 12.</note> 3. If it was not made uſe of in all Sacred matters (where Eire was to be uſed) yet it was moſt Holy, and when Atonement was to be made by Incenſe, the Coals were to be taken from thence <note n="(c)" place="margin">Lev. 16. 12, 46.</note>, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely was as peculiar to thoſe Offices as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and to be as conſtantly uſed in them, as never to be uſed in any other. And it will yet make it more evident if it be conſidered 4. That juſt before there is an account given of the Extraordinary way by which this Fire was lighted, for the Text ſaith, there <hi>came out a Fire from before the Lord, and conſumed upon the Altar the Burnt-Offering,</hi> &amp;c. and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Lev. 9. 24.</note> follows the Relation of <hi>Nadab</hi>'s miſcarriage. Now for what reaſon are theſe things ſo cloſely connected, but to ſhew wherein they Offended. For before it was the Office of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sons to put Fire upon the Altar, and now through Inadvertency or Preſumption Attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Lev. 1. 7.</note> to do as formerly, when there had been this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Heaven to the contrary, they Suffered for it. 5. It appears further from the conformity betwixt the Puniſhment and the Sin; as <hi>there came Fire from before the Lord and conſumed the Burnt-Offering;</hi> to teach
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:160"/> them what Fire for the future to make uſe of; So upon their Tranſgreſſion <hi>there came</hi> out Fire from the Lord and devoured them; to teach others how Dangerous it was to do otherwiſe than he had Commanded. So that it ſeems to me to be like the caſe of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> when <note place="margin">1 Chron. 13. 7. 10. Ch: 15. 2.</note> they carried the Ark in a Cart, which the <hi>Levites</hi> were to have born upon their Shoulders; and it was not an Offering without a Command, but otherwiſe than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that was their Fault; and without doubt they might with no more Offence have taken what Fire they would for their Incenſe, than what Wood they pleaſed for their Fire, if there had been no more direction about the one than the other. But to proceed in the other places of Scripture where this Phraſe of <hi>not Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> is to be met with, its alſo ſo applied to things For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; as to what is called <hi>Abomination,</hi> which is the Worſhiping of <hi>Strange Gods, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Deut. 17: 34. Jer. 7. 31. Ch. 19. 5. Ch. 32. 35.</note> 
                           <hi>the Hoſt of Heaven: To the building the High Places of</hi> Topheth, <hi>and the burning their Sons and Daughters in the Fire to</hi> Baal, <hi>and cauſing them to paſs through the Fire unto</hi> Molech. Of ſuch and the like its ſaid, <hi>which I Commanded them not, neither came it into my mind.</hi> And laſtly it's applied to the falſe Prophets, who <hi>ſpake Lies</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Jer. 29. 22, 23.</note> 
                           <hi>in the Name of the Lord;</hi> in which caſe the meer being not Commanded nor ſent by him, is in the nature of the thing no leſs than a Prohibition, it being a Belying God; though there had been no ſuch place, as, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 20. to forbid it. Now if ſo much ſtreſs was to be laid upon the Phraſe, as the Objection doth ſuppoſe, and that we muſt take a Non-Commanding for a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we might reaſonablly expect to find the Phraſe otherwhere applied to things that were no otherwiſe Unlawful than becauſe not Commanded; but when its always ſpoken of things plainly Prohibited, its a ſign that its rather God's Forbidding that made them Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:160"/> than his not Commanding. But it may ſtill be ſaid, why ſhould then the Phraſe be uſed at all in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and why ſhould the caſe be thus Repreſented, if not Commanded is not the ſame with Prohibited?</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That all things Prohibited are by conſequence not Commanded; but it follows not that all things not Commanded are Prohibited. If it was Forbidden to Offer Strange Fire, then it was a thing not Commanded (for otherwiſe the ſame thing would be Forbidden and Commanded) but if it had been a thing not Commanded only, it would not by being ſo have been any more Prohibited than the Wood that was to be burnt upon the Altar. Now its with reſpect to the former that things Prohibited are call'd things not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and not with reſpect to the latter. 2. Indeed the Phraſe <hi>not Commanded</hi> is only a Meioſis or Softer way of ſpeaking, when more is underſtood than expreſs'd. A Figure uſual in all Authors and Languages, that I know of, and what is frequently to be met with in Scripture. Thus it's given as a Character of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical People, <hi>they chooſe that in which I Delight not,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Iſai. 66: 3. 4: Ch. 65. 3, 12.</note> which is but another Word for what was ſaid in the verſe before, <hi>their Soul Delighted in their Abominations,</hi> or Idolatries. And when the Apoſtle would Deſcribe the evil ſtate of the Gentile World, by the moſt Hainous and Flagitious Crimes, <hi>ſuch as Fornication, Covetouſneſs,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28. 29.</note> 
                           <hi>Laciviouſneſs, Envy, Murder,</hi> and what not, he ſaith of theſe, that they were <hi>things not Convenient.</hi> And it is as evident that the Phraſe <hi>not Commanded</hi> is of the like kind, when the things its applied to are alike Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Abominable.</p>
                        <p>But its further Objected, that its ſaid in Scripture, <label type="milestone">

For therein they differ from our Saviour and his Apoſtles, and all Churches, as I have ſhewed. Therein alſo they depart from the notion and reaſon of the thing: For <hi>adding</hi> is adding to the ſubſtance, and making the thing added of the Nature of the thing its added to; and <hi>diminiſhing</hi> is diminiſhing from the ſubſtance, and taking away from the Nature of it; but when the ſubſtance remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, as much after this humane appointment as it was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:162"/> before it, without Loſs and Prejudice, without Debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Corruption, it cannot be called an addition to it, in the ſence that the Scripture takes that Word in.</p>
                        <p>Nay ſo far are we from admitting this charge, that we return it upon them, and do bring them in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals upon it. For thoſe that do Forbid what the Goſpel Forbids not, do as much add to it, as thoſe that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what the Goſpel doth not Command: And if it be a Crime to Command what that Commands not, it muſt be ſo to Forbid what it Forbids not. And this is what they are Guilty of that do hold that <hi>nothing is to be uſed in the Worſhip of God but what is preſcribed,</hi> for if that be not a Scripture Propoſition and Truth (as certain it is not) then what an addition is this? A greater ſurely than what they charge upon us; for all that is Commanded amongſt us, is look'd upon not as neceſſary but expedient; but what is Forbid by them is Forbid as abſolutely unlawful; the latter of which alters the Nature, whereas the other only affects the Circumſtances of things.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto</hi> 
                           <label type="milestone">

                           <hi>thee any Graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. is frequently made uſe of to prove that we muſt apply nothing to a Religious Uſe but what is Commanded; and we are told that the ſence of it is, that <hi>We muſt Worſhip God in no other way, and by no other means or Religious Rites, than what he hath preſcribed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The beſt way to anſwer this is. 1. To conſider <label type="milestone">

                           </label> what is Forbidden in this Commandment, and 2. To ſhew that we are not concern'd in the Prohibition. As to the former.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In this Command it is provided, that there be no act of Adoration given to any beſides God. By this the Heathens are condemned in their Plurality of Gods, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:162"/> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Veneration they give to Saints and Angels.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Honour we give to God be ſutable to his Nature, and agreeable to his Will. Sutable to his Nature; and ſo we are not to Worſhip him by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that is to conſider him as Finite; nor by Images and Eternal Repreſentations, for that is to conſider him as Corporeal: Agreeable to his Will; and ſo we are Forbidden all other Worſhip of him than what he hath appointed. Its in the laſt of theſe we are concerned, for I believe there will be no attempt to prove that there is any thing in our Worſhip that doth derogate from the perfections of God, and is unſutable to his Nature, further than the defects that muſt ariſe from all Worſhip given by Creatures to a Creator. And if we come to conſider it as to what he hath revealed, there can be nothing deduced thence to prove Rites inſtituted by Men for the Solemnity of God's ſervice to be Forbidden; and which for ought I ſee is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be proved from this Commandment, or from Scripture elſe where, but by crowding ſuch Rites into and repreſenting them as a part of Divine Worſhip. This way goes one of the moſt induſtrious in this cauſe. <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are External Rites of Religious Worſhip as uſed to further Devotion, and therefore being</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ames Freſh Suit, part. 2. ſect. 2. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, p. 228.</note> 
                           <hi>invented by Man are of the ſame Nature with Images, by which and at which God is Worſhipped.</hi> In which are no leſs than three miſtakes. As 1. He makes whatever is uſed to further Devotion to be Religious Worſhip. 2. He makes it a fault in External Rites in Religious Worſhip that they are uſed to further Devotion 3. He makes External Rites taken up by Men, and uſed for that end to be of the ſame Nature with Images. If I ſhew that theſe are really miſtakes, I think that in doing ſo the whole argument taken from 2d. Commandment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:163"/> falls with it. 1, He miſtakes, in that he makes <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is uſed to further Devotion, to be Religious Worſhip:</hi> The error of which will appear from this conſideration; that all things relating to Divine Worſhip, are either Parts or Adjuncts of it; Parts, as Prayer, and the Lord's Supper; Adjuncts, as Form and Poſture. Now Adjuncts are not Parts, becauſe the Worſhip is intire and invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all the Parts of it, and remains the ſame though the Adjuncts vary. Prayer is VVorſhip, whether with a Form or without; and the Lord's Supper is VVorſhip, whether Perſons Kneel, Sit or Stand, in the receiving of it. And yet though the Adjuncts are no part of VVorſhip, they further Devotion in it. This thoſe that are for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer, plead for Their Practice, and this alſo is pleaded by thoſe that are for a Form. This do they urge, that are for Sitting at the Lord's Supper, and this they ſay, that are for Kneeling; ſo that theſe and the like Adjuncts do further Devotion, and are for Edification, is an argument uſed by both. Now if Adjuncts are not part of VVorſhip, and may be yet uſed to further Devotion, then the furthering Devotion by any Rite, doth not in it ſelf make that Rite ſo uſed, to be VVorſhip. I acknowledg there is Falſe VVorſhip as well as True; True VVorſhip is of Divine Inſtitution, and Falſe VVorſhip is of Humane Appointment; and becomes Worſhip, when either Divine Inſtitution is pretended for it or its uſed for the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ends that Gods VVorſhip is inſtituted for, that is, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to acceptance, or as a means of Grace. And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Adjuncts may be made parts of Falſe VVorſhip, as many Ceremonies are in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but this is not the caſe with any things uſed in the Adminiſtration of VVorſhip in our Church; we plead nothing of Divine Authority to enforce them, uſe them not as neceſſary, nor as means of Grace; after the manner we do the VVord of God, and the Sacraments. 2. Its another miſtake, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:163"/> its charged as a fault upon Rites in VVorſhip, that <hi>They are uſed to further Devotion.</hi> VVithout this end ſurely they are not to be uſed, or at leaſt not to be encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for Divine VVorſhip being the acknowledgment of God, and a giving Honour to Him, ſhould have all things about it Grave and Solemn, that may beſt ſute it, and promote the ends for which its uſed, But if Rites are uſed in it, that have no reſpect to ſuch ends, they become Vain and Trifling, neither worthy of that nor our Defence. And therefore we juſtly blame the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Multitude of Ceremonies uſed in their VVorſhip, and for ſuch, that either have no ſignification, or whoſe ſignification is ſo obſcure, as is not eaſie to be obſerved or traced, and that rather hinder than further Devotion. Surely it would not ſo well anſwer the end, if the Hand in Swearing was laid upon another Book, as when on the Goſpel; nor if the Love-feaſts at the Lords Supper had been only as a Common Meal, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Charity ſignified by it. 3. Its another miſtake that <hi>External Rites taken up by Men, and uſed for the furthering Devotion, are made to be of the ſame Nature with Images.</hi> This there is no foundation for, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious uſe of Images is expreſly contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and Forbidden, becauſe it tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe God in the thoughts of thoſe that VVorſhip him by ſuch mediums. But there is nothing in the uſe of ſuch External Ries (as are before ſpoken of) that fall under the cenſure of either of theſe; but that we may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe them, and the uſe of which is not therefore at all Forbidden in the Second Commandment.</p>
                        <p>If there be not a Rule for all things belonging to the VVorſhip of God, the Goſpel would be leſs perfect than <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>IV</label> the Law; and Chriſt would not be ſo Faithful as <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the care of his Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. which is not to be ſuppoſed.</p>

                           </label> are not to be judged of by what we fancy they ſhould have determined, but by what they have. Its a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Plea made by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for an Infallible Judge in matters of Faith, that by an Appeal to him all controverſies would be decided, and the Peace of the Church ſecured. But notwithſtanding all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which they ſo hugely amplify, there is not one Word in Scripture (which in a matter of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is abſolutely neceſſary) that doth ſhew that it is neceſſary; or (were it ſo) who the Perſon or Perſons are that ſhould have this Power or Commiſſion. And in this caſe we muſt be content to leave things as the Wiſdom of God hath thought fit to leave them, and to go on in the old way of ſober and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable debate and fair reaſoning to bring debates to a concluſion. Thus it is in the matter before us, the pretence is very Popular and Plauſible, that, Who can better determine things Relating to the Worſhip of God, than God whoſe Worſhip it is? And where may we expect to find them better determined than in his Word, which is ſufficient to all the ends it was writ for? But when we come to enquire into the caſe, we find no ſuch thing done, no ſuch care taken, no ſuch particular directions as they had under the Law; and therefore its certain that neither the ſufficiency of Scripture, nor Faithfulneſs of Chriſt ſtand upon that foundation. And if we do not find the like particular preſcriptions in Baptiſm as Circumciſion; nor in the Lord's Supper as in the Paſſover; nor in Prayers as in Sacrifices; its plain that the ſufficiency of Scripture and Faithfulneſs of Chriſt do reſpect ſomewhat elſe, and that they are not the leſs for the want of them. Chriſt was Faithful, as <hi>Moſes, To him that appointed him,</hi> in performing what belonged to him as a Mediator (in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:164"/> which reſpect <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Type of him) and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mankind in Scripture the method and means by which they might be Sav'd; and the ſufficiency of Scripture is in being a ſufficient means to that end, and putting Men into ſuch State as will render them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of attaining to it. And as for modes and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things, they are left to the prudence of thoſe who by the Grace and the Word of God hath been converted to the Truth, and have received it in the Love of it. I have been the larger in the conſideration of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Nothing but what is preſcribed may be lawfully uſed in Divine Worſhip,</hi> that I might relieve the conſciences of thoſe that are inſnared by it, and that cannot be ſo, without ſubjecting themſelves to great inconveniences. For if nothing but what is of that Nature may be uſed or joyned with, and that the ſecond Commandment doth with as much Authority Forbid the uſe of any thing not Commanded, as the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images: If <hi>Nadab</hi>'s and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s Strange Fire, and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi>'s touching of the Ark be examples Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for caution to us, and that every thing Uncomman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is of the like Nature, attended with the like Aggravations, and alike do expoſe to God's Diſpleaſure: If the uſe of any thing not preſcribed be ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the VVord of God, as leaves us under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of that Text; <hi>If any Man ſhall add unto theſe things,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>God ſhall add unto him the Plagues that are Written in this Book;</hi> we cannot be too cautious in the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is, or what is not preſcribed. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, if this be our caſe, it would be more intollerable than that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For amongſt them every thing for the moſt part was plainly laid down, and though the particular Rites and Circumſtances preſcribed in their Service were many, yet they were ſufficiently deſcrib'd in their Law, and it was but conſulting that, or Thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:165"/> whoſe Office and Employment it was to be well verſed in it, and they might be preſently inform'd, and as ſoon ſee it as the Book was laid open. This they all agreed in. But it is not ſo under the Goſpel, and there is no greater proof of it than the ſeveral ſchemes drawn up for Diſcipline, and Order, by thoſe that have been of that Opinion and made ſome attemps to diſcribe them. And then when things are thus dark and obſcure, ſo hard to trace and diſcover, that it has thus perplexed and baffled thoſe that have made it their buſineſs to bring theſe things within Scripture Rules, how perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt they be that are not skilled in it, And (as I have above ſhewed) muſt all their Days live in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it's likely, of no Church; ſince though a Church ſhould have nothing in it but what is preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it would take up a great deal of time to examine, and more to be ſatisfied, that all in it is preſcribed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I ſhall conſider, <hi>How we may know what things are Indifferent in the Worſhip of God?</hi> I may anſwer to this, that we may know what is Indifferent in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, by the ſame Rule that we may know what is Indifferent out of Worſhip, that is, if the thing to be enquired after, be neither required nor Forbidden: For the Nature of Indifferency is always the ſame, and what it is in one kind or inſtance, it is in all; and if the want of a Law, to Require or Forbid, doth make a thing Indifferent in Nature or Civil matters; it doth alſo the ſame in Religious: And in things Forbidden by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, the not being required in Scripture; and in things required by Humane Authority, the not being Forbidden in Scripture, is a Rule we may ſafely determine the caſe, and judg of the Lawfulneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of things in <hi>Divine Worſhip by.</hi> But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Queſtion requires a more parcicular Anſwer, becauſe things in their Nature Lawful and Indifferent,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:165"/> may yet, in their uſe and application, become unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. As it is in Civil caſes and Secular matters, to be Covered or Uncovered is a thing in it ſelf Indifferent; but to be Covered in the preſence of ſuch of our Betters, as Cuſtom and Law have made it our Duty to ſtand bare before, would be unlawful, and it would be no excuſe for ſuch an Omiſſion and Contempt, that the thing is in it ſelf Indifferent. And then much more will this hold where the caſe is of an higher Nature; as it is in the Worſhip of God, where things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Indifferent may become Ridiculous, Abſurd and Profane, and argue rather contempt of God than reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for him in the Perſons uſing them. Again, the things may, though Grave and Pertinent, yet be ſo numerous that they may obſcure and oppreſs the Service, and confound and diſtract the Mind that ſhould attend to the Obſervation of them; and ſo for one reaſon or another are not to be allowed in the Solemnities of Religion. Therefore in Anſwer to the Queſtion, I ſhall add,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That things Indifferent are ſo called from their general Nature, and not as if in practice and uſe, and all manner of caſes, they always were ſo, and never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; for that they may be by Accident and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, being lawful or unlawful, expedient or inex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pedient, as they are uſed and applied.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I obſerve that there are ſeveral Laws which things Indifferent do reſpect; and that may be Required or Forbidden by one Law, which is not Forbidden or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by another; and that may be Indifferent in one State which is Unlawful in another, and by paſſing out of one into the other may ceaſe to be Indifferent, and therefore when we ſay things are Indifferent, we muſt underſtand of what Rank they are, and what Law they do reſpect; As for example, Humane Converſation,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:166"/> and Religious Worſhip are different Ranks to which things are referred; and therefore what may be Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Converſation, may be unlawful in Worſhip. Thus to Enterchange Diſcourſe about Common Affairs, is a thing lawful in it ſelf, and uſeful in its place; but when practiſed in the Church, and in the midſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Solemnities, is Criminal. This diſtinction of Ranks and States of things is uſeful and neceſſary to be obſerved, and which if obſerved would have prevented the objection made by ſome, that if a Church or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may Command Indifferent things, then they may require us to Pray Standing upon the head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that though Indifferent in another caſe, is not in that, as being unſutable to it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Therefore we muſt come to ſome Rules in Divine Worſhip, by which we may know what things in their Nature Indifferent, are therein alſo Indifferent, and may be lawfully uſed: It being not enough to plead they are Indifferent in themſelves (as ſome unwarily do) and therefore preſently they may be uſed; For by the ſame reaſon, a Perſon may Spit in anothers Face, may keep on his Hat before the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Spitting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covered, being in their Nature Indifferent, But now as there are certain Rules which we are to reſpect in Common and Civil Converſation, and which even in that caſe do tye us up in the uſe of things, otherwiſe Indifferent: So it is as reaſonable, and muſt be much more allowed, that there are ſome Rules of the like Nature which we muſt have a regard to in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Divine Worſhip. And as in Common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Nature of the thing; in Actions the end; in Converſation the circumſtances are to be heeded, <hi>viz.</hi> Time, Place, Perſons; as when, where, before whom we are Covered or Uncovered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in Sacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the Nature of the thing, in the Decency and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:166"/> of the Worſhip; the end for which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, in the Edification of the Church; and the Peace, Glory, Security of that, in its Order are to be reſpected. And according to theſe Rules and the circumſtances of things, are we to judg of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, Lawfulneſs, or expediency of things uſed in the Service of God; and as they do make for, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and do approach to, or recede from theſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, ſo they are to be rejected or obſerved, and the more or leſs eſteemed. But yet we are not come to a concluſion, for 1. Theſe are general Rules, and ſo the particulars are nor ſo eaſily pointed to. 2. Decency, and Edification, and Order are (as was obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) Variable and Uncertain, and depend upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſo in their Nature not eaſily determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And, 3. Perſons have very different Opinions about what is Decent, Edifying, and Orderly; as in the Apoſtles time in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome were for, and others againſt, the Obſervation of Days; and in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſome doubtleſs were for being Covered, others for being Uncovered, in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And therefore there is ſomewhat further requiſite to give Satisfaction in the point; and by which we may be able to Judg what is Decent, Edifying, and Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as well as we are by what is Decent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is fit to be uſed in Religious Worſhip. And this we may be help'd in by conſidering,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That ſome things make ſo Eminently for, or are ſo Notoriouſly oppoſite to theſe Rules, that Common Reaſon will be able forthwith to Judge of them, and to declare for or againſt them. So when the Love-feaſts, and the Lords Supper were appointed for the teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and increaſe of mutual Charity; if one took his Supper before another, it was to make it rather a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 20, 21.</note> Meal, than a Religious Feaſt, and ſo was a Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                        <p n="2">2. But there are other things which are not ſo Clear and Evident, and ſo the caſe needs further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For the clearing of which we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we are not ſo much to Judge of Decency, Order, and Edification aſunder, as together; theſe having a mutual Relation to and dependance upon each other. So its well obſerved by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, That</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chryſ. in 1 Cor. Ch. 14. 40. 1 Cor. 14. 26.</note> 
                           <hi>nothing doth ſo much Edify, as Order, Peace and Love:</hi> And the Apoſtle when he had reproved the Diſorders of their Service in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> concludes it, <hi>Let all things be done to Edifying.</hi> The not obſerving of this is the occaſion of very great Miſtakes in this matter; For Perſons when they would Judge of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation conſider preſently what they conceive doth moſt improve them in Knowledge or any particular Grace; and having no further conſideration, for the ſake of this throw down the Bounds of Publick Order and bring all into Confuſion; and for Edifying (as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend) themſelves do Diſturb if not Deſtroy the Church of God, and render the means uſed in it inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to themſelves and others. Thus again they Judge of what is Decent, and Indecent; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is no Indecency in Sitting, ſuppoſe at
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:168"/> the Sacrament, or the Prayers; but they miſtake in ſuch a conception, whilſt what is againſt publick Order and Practice, is for that reaſon Indecent, were there no other reaſon to make it ſo. So that if we would Judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of either of theſe we muſt Judge of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as Order alone is not enough to make a thing Decent which is in it ſelf Indecent; ſo Decency or particular Edification is not enough to recommend that which is not to be Introduced or Obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Diſturbance and Overthrow of publick Order and Peace.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When the caſe is not apparent, we ſhould rather Judge by what is contrary than by what is agreeable to thoſe Rules. We know better what things are not than what they are: And if Chriſtians ſhould never agree to any thing in the External Adminiſtration of Divine Worſhip till they agree in the notion of Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Order, and Edification; or till they can prove that the things uſed, or required to be uſed in a Church, do exactly agree to the Notion and Definition of it; Worſhip muſt never be Adminiſtred, or the greater part of Chriſtians muſt Exclude themſelves from it. And yet this muſt be done before it can be poſitively ſaid (unleſs in things very manifeſt) that this is Decent, or that is Orderly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things as I have ſaid are variable, and depend upon Circumſtances; and ſo Perſons muſt needs be Wonderfully Confounded if they come to Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inſiſt upon them. And therefore as we better know what is Indecent than Decent, Diſorderly than Orderly, againſt than for Edification, ſo its better to take the courſe aboveſaid in Judging about it. As for inſtance, if we would enquire into the Decency of the Poſture to be uſed in the Lord's Supper, or the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may ariſe from it; ſome will ſay its beſt to receive it in the Poſture frequently uſed in the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:169"/> of the ancient Church of Standing or Incurvation; others would chooſe Sitting, as the diſſenting Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and ſome Forreign Churches; others be for the Poſture of Kneeling, uſed in ours and many more, and all with ſome ſhew of Reaſon. In theſe different caſes it may not perhaps be ſo eaſy for a Perſon (Educated in a different way from what is practiſed and Preſcribed) to Judg of the Decency or Edification; but if he find it not Indecent, or Deſtructive of Piety, and of the ends for which the Ordinance was Inſtituted, he is therewith to ſatisfy himſelf. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> puts alike caſe, and gives the like anſwer. <hi>Some Churches Faſt on the Saturday,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epiſt. 118.</note> 
                           <hi>becauſe Chriſt's Body was then in the Grave, and he in a State of Humiliation. Others do Eat on the Saturday, both, becauſe that Day God Reſted from his Work, and Chriſt Reſted in the Grave.</hi> And how in ſuch a caſe to Determine our ſelves, both in Opinion and Practice, that Father thus directs, <hi>If</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what is joyned be not againſt Faith, or good Manners, it is to be accounted Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> And I may add, if it be not Indecent, Diſorderly and Deſtructive of Piety, its lawful.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the caſe be not apparent, and we cannot eaſily find out how the things uſed, and injoyned in a Church, are Decent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are to conſider that we are in, or Obliged to be of a Church, and that theſe things do reſpect ſuch a Society; and therefore are to be Cautious how we Condemn this or that for Indecent, Confuſed, and Inexpedient, when we ſee Chriſtians agreeing in the Practice of them, and ſuch whom for other things we cannot Condemn. When we find, if we argue againſt it, they argue for it, and produce Experience againſt Experience, and Reaſon againſt Reaſon, and that we have a whole Church againſt our particular conceptions of things of this Nature; we ſhould be apt to think the Fault may be in our ſelves, and that its for want of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:169"/> Underſtanding and Inſight, for want of Uſe and Tryal, and by Reaſon of ſome Prejudices or Profeſſions, that we thus differ in our Judgment from them. We ſee what little things do Determin Men ordinarily in theſe matters; how addicted ſome are to their own Ways and Cuſtoms, and forward to Like or Condemn, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Education, which doth form their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and fix their inclinations; how Prone again others are to Novelty and Innovation. So St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epiſt. 1. 3.</note> obſerves, ſome warmly contend for an uſage, <hi>becauſe its the Cuſtom of their own Church; as if they come, ſuppoſe into another Place where Lent is obſerved without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, they however refuſe to Faſt, becauſe its not ſo done in their Country.</hi> There are others again do like, and are bent upon a particular Rite or Uſage, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they obſerv'd this in their Travels abroad, and ſo a Perſon is for it, as perhaps he would be thought ſo much the more Learned and Conſiderable, as he is diſtant, or doth diſagree, from what is obſerved at home.</hi> Now when Perſons are Prone thus to Judg upon ſuch little Reaſons, and may miſtake in their Judgment, and do Judg againſt a Church (which they have no other Reaſon againſt) it would become them to think again; and to think that the caſe perhaps requires only time, or uſe, to wear off their Prejudices, and that by theſe ways they may as effectually be reconciled to the things Practiſed in a Church, as they are to the Civil Uſages and the Habits of a Nation, which at the firſt they looked upon in their kind as Indecent and Inexpedient, as they can do of the Uſages of a Church in theirs. As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Diſpute ſhould be about Forms of Prayer, or the uſe of reſponſals in it, we ſee that Decency, Order, and Edification are pleaded by the Parties contending for and againſt, but when a Perſon conſiders that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Opinion he therein hath, yet if he be againſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:170"/> them, he is at the ſame time againſt all formed Churches in the World, he may conclude ſafely that there is a Decency, Order, and Expediency in the Publick uſe of them; and as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of a Chriſtian living in <note place="margin">Epiſt. 86. Caſulano.</note> 
                           <hi>Rome</hi> where they faſted upon the Saturday that <hi>ſuch a one ſhould not ſo praiſe a Chriſtian City for it, as to Condemn the Chriſtian World that was againſt it,</hi> ſo we ſhould not be ſo Zealous againſt a Practice, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe that are for it, and be ſo addicted to our own Opinion as to ſet that againſt a Community and a Church, nay againſt all Churches whatſoever. This will give us reaſon to ſuſpect its a <hi>Zeal without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> when we preſume to ſet our Judgment, Reaſon, and Experience, againſt the Judgment, Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Chriſtian World. Which brings to the Fourth General.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>How are we to determine our ſelves in the uſe of Indifferent things with reſpect to the Worſhip of God?</hi> For reſolution of which, we are to conſider our ſelves in a threefold Capacity, 1. As particular Perſons, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and alone. 2. As we are in Ordinary and Civil Converſation. 3. As we are Members of a Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Church.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt capacity, every Chriſtian may chuſe and act as he pleaſeth; and all Lawful things remain to him, as they are in their own Nature, Free. He may eat this or that; chuſe this day or another, and ſet it apart for the Service of God and his own Soul. In this ſtate, where there is no Law of Man to require, he may forbear to uſe what is Indifferent; where there is no Law to Forbid, he may freely uſe it.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond capacity, as in Converſation with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he is to have a regard to them, and to uſe his Liberty ſo as ſhall be leſs to the prejudice, and more to the benefit of thoſe he converſes with. So ſaith the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:170"/> Apoſtle, <hi>all things are lawful for me, but all things are</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 23.</note> 
                           <hi>not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but all things Edify not.</hi> In this Capacity Men are ſtill in their own Power; and whilſt its no Sin they may ſafely act, and where its no Sin they may forbear in complyance with thoſe that are not yet advanced to the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of Judgment with themſelves; as the Apoſtle did, <hi>Though,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I be free from all Men, yet have I</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 19, &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>made my ſelf Servant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the</hi> Jews <hi>I became a</hi> Jew, &amp;c. In ſuch a caſe the ſtrong ſhould not deſpiſe, affront, or diſcourage the weak; nor the weak cenſure and condemn the ſtrong.</p>
                        <p>In the third Capacity, as we are Members of a Church and Religious Society, ſo the uſe of Indifferent things comes under further conſideration, ſince then the Practice of a Church and the Commands of Authority are to be reſpected. And as what we may lawfully do when alone, we are not to do in Converſation, becauſe of Offence: So what we may allowably do when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone or in Converſation, we muſt not do in Society, if Forbidden by the Laws and Cuſtoms of it. For the ſame reaſon (if there was no more) that Reſtrains or Determines us in Converſation, is as much more forcible in Society, as the Peace and Welfare of the whole is to be preferred before that of a part; And if the not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Brother, or endangering his Soul makes it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, juſt, and neceſſary to forego our Liberty, and to Reſtrain our ſelves in the exerciſe of it, then much more is the Peace of a Church (upon which the preſent Welfare of the whole, and the Future Welfare of many depend) a ſufficient reaſon for ſo doing, and to Oblige us to act or not to act accordingly. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his Neighbour for his good to</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Edification,</hi> that is, to his Improvement in Knowledg
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:171"/> or Grace, or Chriſtian Piety, and the promoting of Chriſtian Concord and Charity: Now Edification is eminently ſo with reſpect to the whole, as the Church is <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> and every Chriſtian one of the <hi>living Stones</hi> of which that Spiritual building is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted; <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> and ſo he is to conſider himſelf, as well as he is to be conſidered, as a part of it, and to ſtudy what may be for the Edification of the whole, as well as the good of any particular Member of it. And how is that but by promoting Love, Peace, and Order, and taking Care to Preſerve it? So we find Edification Oppoſed <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 8. 1. Cor. 14. 26. 1 Tim. 1. 4.

And therefore as the Good and Edification of the whole is to be always in our Eye, ſo its the Rule by which we ought to act in all things lawful; and to that end ſhould comply with its Cuſtoms, obſerve its Directions, and Obey its Orders, without Reluctancy and Oppoſition. Thus the Apoſtle reſolves the caſe, Writing about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order and the Cuſtom newly taken up of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Uncovered, <hi>if any Man ſeem,</hi> or have a mind <hi>to be, contentions, we have no ſuch Cuſtom, neither the</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:171"/> the Obſervation of its Couſtoms, that is infinitely to be preferred before Scrupuloſity and Niceneſs, or a meer inclination to a contrary Practice. For in publick caſes a Man is not to go his own way, or to have his own mind, for that would bring in Confuſion (one Man having as much a right as another.) There muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Eſtabliſhed, ſome Common Order and Bond of Union; and if Confuſion is before ſuch Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to break that Eſtabliſhment, would bring in Confuſion; and where that is likely to enſue, it is not worth the while for the Tryal of a new Experiment to decry and throw down what is already Eſtabliſhed or Uſed in a Church, becauſe we think better of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for ſaith a Grave Author, and well Skill'd in theſe matters, <hi>The very change of a Cuſtom though it may</hi>

I ſay it again, Infirmity in a Church is better than Confuſion, or Deſtruction, which is the Conſequent of it: And I had rather chooſe that as I would a Houſe, to have one with ſome Faults, rather then to have none at all; And if I cannot have them mended (when tolerable) I think my ſelf bound not only to bear with them, but to do all I can for its preſervation though with them, and to obſerve all things that are lawful for its ſupport and encouragement. In doing thus I ſerve God, and his Church, my own Soul and the Souls of others; promote Religion and Charity in the World; <hi>For God is not the Author of Confuſion but of Peace in all the</hi>

                           <hi>Churches of the Saints.</hi> In things which neither we nor the Worſhip are the worſe for, but the Church the better for obſerving Peace and Order is far to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before Niceties: And certainly neither we nor the Service of God can be the worſe for what God hath concluded nothing in. What the Goſpel looks as is the Main and Eſſential parts of Religion in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Practice. And if theſe be Secured, we are under no Obligation to contend for or againſt the modes and circumſtances of things further than the Churches Order and Peace is concerned in them. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Let not your Good be Evil ſpoken of: For the Kingdom of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 16.</note>

Epiſt. 86.</note> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and all its obſervations are but its veſture, which though various in different Churches, are no prejudice to the Common Faith, nor to him that uſeth them.</q> And therefore what he and his mother received from St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Divine Oracle, is worthy to be recommended to all, <hi>That in all things not contrary to Truth and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>And if the Cuſtom and Practice of a Church ſhould be thus taken into conſideration by a Good Man, then certainly much more ought it ſo to be, when that is Eſtabliſhed, and is made a Law, and is backed by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For then to ſtand in Oppoſition is not only an Offence but an Affront; and to inſiſt upon the Gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own Inclination againſt publick Order, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend whether we or our Superiours ſhall Govern, whether
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:172"/> our Will or the publick Good and Order muſt take place. And what can be the Iſſue of ſuch a Temper but the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction if not Diſſolution of Government; which as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without Governed as well as Governours, ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſerved without the ſubmiſſion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all lawful things to the Gevernours; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to chooſe and determine in things of that kind as they ſhall ſee meet. Its pleaded <hi>That there ſhould be a Liberty left to Chriſtians in things <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndetermined in Scripture,</hi> and ſuch things indeed there are that Chriſtians may have a Liberty in and yet hold Communion, as in Poſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (though Decency Would plead for Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in thoſe things alſo) but there are other things which they muſt agree in, or elſe there can be no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip or Chriſtian Communion, which yet they differ in as much as the other. As now whether Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is to be celebrated with or without a Form; whether the Lord's Supper is to be received in the Morning or Evening; whether Prayers ſhould be long or ſhort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now unleſs one of theſe diſagreeing Parties doth Yield to the other; or there be a Power in Superiours and Guides to determine for them, and they are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them in it, there will be nothing but confuſion. And why Superiours may not then Command; and why Inferiours are not to obey in all things of the like kind; In Poſture or Habit, as well as the time (above ſpecified) and Forms, I underſtand not.</p>
                        <p>To conlude this, if we find any thing required or generally practiſed in a Church, that is not Forbidden in Scripture; or any thing Omitted or Forbidden in a Church, that is not required in Scripture; we may and ought to Act or to forbear as they that are of its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion do generally Act or forbear, or the Laws of that Communion require; and in ſuch things are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:173"/> by the publick Voice of the Communion, that is, Authority, Cuſtom, or the Majority.</p>
                        <p>But to this it will be ſaid, If we are thus to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <label type="milestone">

                           <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note>

                        <p n="2">2. A reſtraint of our Liberty, or receding from it is of it ſelf, no violation of it. All Perſons grant this in the latter, and the moſt ſcrupulous are apt to plead that the Strong ought to bear with the Weak, and to give no Offence to them by indulging themſelves in that Liberty which others are afraid to take. But now if a Perſon may recede from his Liberty, and yet is bound ſo to do in the caſe of Scandal, and yet his Liberty be not thereby infringed, why may it not be alſo little infringed, when reſtrained by others? How can it be ſuppoſed, that there ſhould be ſo vaſt a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt reſtraint and reſtraint, and that he that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Authority ſhould have his Liberty prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and yet he that is reſtrained <hi>By anothers Conſcience</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 29.</note> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) ſhould keep intire? And if it ſhould be ſaid this is Occaſional, but the other is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated by the Order, perhaps, of a Church. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that all Orders about Indifferent things are but temporary, and are only intended to bond ſo long as they are for the good of the Community. And if they are for continuance, that alters not the caſe; For though the Apoſtle knew his own Liberty and where there was Juſt Reaſon could inſiſt upon it, yet he did not ſuppoſe that could be damnified, though for his whole life it was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:173"/> reſtrain'd. For thus he reſolves, <hi>If meat make my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the World ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> which certainly he would not have condeſcended to, if ſuch a Practice was not reconcileable to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of <hi>ſtanding faſt in that Liberty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Therefore to find out the tendency of his Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, its fit to underſtand what Chriſtian Liberty is, and that is truly no other than the Liberty which Mankind naturally had, before it was reſtrain'd by particular inſtitution; and which is call'd Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews</hi> which had it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Law, but were reſtrain'd from the Practice and uſe of things, otherwiſe and in themſelves Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by ſevere Prohibitions. Now as all the World was then divided into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo the Liberty which the <hi>Jews</hi> were before denied, was call'd Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, becauſe by the coming of Chriſt, all theſe former reſtraints were taken off, and all the World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> did enjoy it. And therefore when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth exhort them to <hi>ſtand faſt in it,</hi> it was, as the Scope of the Epiſtle doth ſhew, to warn them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt returning to that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, and againſt thoſe who held it neceſſary for both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ſtill to obſerve all the Rites and Orders of it. Now if the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of a Church were of the ſame kind, or had the ſame tendency, or were alike neceſſarily impos'd as thoſe of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, then Chriſtians would be concerned in the Apoſtles Exhortation; but where theſe reaſons are not, our Liberty is not at all prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by compliance with them. As long I ſay, as they are neither peccant in their Nature, nor End, nor Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they are not unlawful to us, nor is our Liberty injur'd in the uſe of them. And ſo I am brought to the laſt General, which is,</p>
                        <p>V. That there is nothing required in our Church
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:174"/> which is not either a duty in it ſelf; and ſo neceſſary to all Chriſtians, or elſe what is indifferent, and ſo may be lawfully uſed by them. By things required, I mean, ſuch as are uſed in the Communion and Service of our Church, and impoſed upon the Lay-members of it (for theſe are the things my Subject doth more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reſpect.) This is a Subject too Copious for me to follow through all the particulars of it; and indeed it will be needleſs for me to enlarge upon it, if the foundation I have laid be good, and the Rules before given are fit meaſures for us to Judge of the lawfulneſs, or unlawfulneſs of things by; for by theſe we ſhall ſoon bring the Cauſe to an Iſſue. I think there is nothing to be charged upon our Church for being defective in any Eſſential part of Divine Worſhip (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in its Half-Communion) nor of any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice that is apparently inconſiſtent with, or that doth defeat the ends of any Inſtitution (as the ſame Church doth offend by having its Service in an unknown Tongue, and in the multitudes of its Ceremonies). I think it will be acknowledged, that the Word of God is ſincerely and freely Preached, the Sacraments intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly Adminiſtred, the Prayers for matter inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and good. And therefore the matter in diſpute is about the Miniſtration of our Worſhip, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its performance; and I think the things of that kind Objected againſt, refer either to Time, or Forms, or Geſture. To Times, ſuch are Feſtivals, or Days ſet apart for Divine Service; to Forms ſuch are our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Adminiſtration of our Sacraments; to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, as Standing up at the Creed or Goſpels, and Kneeling at the Lord's Supper. But now all theſe are either Natural or Moral Circumſtances of Action, and which, as I have ſhewed, are inſeparable from it. Of the former kind are Days and Geſtures; of the latter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:174"/> are Forms of Adminiſtration, and ſo upon the reaſons before given may be lawfully determined and uſed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, theſe are not forbidden by any Law, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or conſequentially, and have nothing that is indecent, diſorderly or unedifying in them; and which if any ſhould engage his own opinion and experience in, he would be anſwered in the like kind, and have the opinions and experience of Thouſands that live in the practice of theſe, to contradict him. And if there be nothing of this kind apparent, or what can be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd, (as I am apt to beleive there cannot) then the Propoſition I have laid down needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof. But if at laſt it muſt iſſue in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient to Chriſtians, or an unlawfulneſs in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure; are either of theſe fit to be inſiſted upon, when the peace of one of the beſt Churches in the World is broken by it, a lamentable Schiſm kept up, and our Religion brought into imminent hazard by both? Alas how near have we been to ruin, and I wiſh I had no reaſon to ſay, how near are we to it, conſidering the indefatigable induſtry, the united endeavours, the matchleſs policy of thoſe that contrive and deſire it! Can we think that we are ſafe, as long as there is ſuch an abiding reaſon to make us ſuſpect it, and that our diviſions are both fomented, and made uſe of by them to deſtroy us? And if this be our danger, and Union as neceſſary as deſirable, ſhall we yet make the breach wider, or irreparable by an obſtinate contention? God forbid! <hi>O pray for the Peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that love thee: Let Peace be within thy Walls, and Proſperity within thy Palaces.</hi> Amen.</p>

                        <p>This was the way I took, and if I did manage it as it ſhould, I am pretty confident that the <hi>Queſtion was not beg'd,</hi> though I never thought of coming near his Queſtion, <hi>who ſhall be, the Judge?</hi>

                        <p>

                           <hi>nor forbidden,</hi> it muſt follow that things are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in Divine Worſhip becauſe they are <hi>not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The conſequence is plain and undeniable: For if the Nature of Things Indifferent be, as aboveſaid, <hi>what are neither commanded nor forbidden,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make this or that to be unlawful but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forbidden: But now if the being <hi>not Commanded</hi> is the ſame with the <hi>being Forbidden,</hi> then the notion of Indifferent Things cannot conſiſt in this that they are neither Commanded nor Forbidden. So that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt quit the Argument, and grant that the being not Commanded, doth not make a thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Divine Worſhip; or they muſt alter the notion of Indifferent things, and indeed utterly exterminate them, and leave no ſuch middle things in nature, and ſay that there is nothing elſe but Duty or Sin.</p>
                        <p>Now after our Reverend Author hath ſo frankly granted this, I cannot underſtand how he can ſay that <hi>the doing of a thing in Gods Worſhip, not Commanded, is guilt enough:</hi> nor why he ſhould take ſuch pains to <note place="margin">p. 25.</note> oppoſe what I have offered in confutation of that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. For what can he plead for the unlawfulneſs of things <hi>not Commanded,</hi> who hath granted that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>not Commanded</hi> is a branch of ſuch things as are Indifferent: And if he will maintain it, he muſt do it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:178"/> upon no leſs abſurdity, than the ſaying a thing Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent is forbidden; or (which is the ſame) that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, are ſuch as are either forbidden, or not forbidden.</p>
                        <p>But let us abſtract the Caſe of things <hi>not Commanded</hi> from this conſequence, and take it as it is in the Tract <note place="margin">

                           <hi>4ly.</hi> What Account our Author himſelf gives at laſt of this.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Saith he, Things forbidden in Scripture are ſaid to be not commanded, <hi>To let us know the doing of a thing not commanded in God's Worſhip, is Guilt enough.</hi> Surely not ſo great, as to do a thing noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe Indiff. Things.</hi> pag. 20.</note> forbidden, (as I there ſhewed.) Surely it can be no Guilt at all to do a thing not commanded, if not alſo forbidden, becauſe (as he owns) there are Indifferent Things in the Worſhip of God; and what are indifferent Things, but Things not commanded, as well as not forbidden?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He ſaith, it was ſo expreſs'd, becauſe <hi>the Guilt of the Sin of Idolatry and Superſtition lay in this, that it was a thing not commanded: had God commanded thoſe things, they had been a true Worſhip, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:179"/>
                        <p>In which aſſertion of his, he groſly miſtakes. Firſt, as to the nature of Idolatry and Superſtition, when he ſaith, <hi>the guilt of them lay in this, that they were things not commanded:</hi> Whereas it is evident that they were Sins, becauſe forbidden. For what is Superſtition but the dreading of that which is not to be dreaded? (as the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſhews;) Such as <hi>the Signs of Heaven,</hi> Divinations, and Daemons, and even the unreaſonable and inordinate fear of God himſelf. When we fear <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 2.</note> offending him, in what is not offenſive to him. And what is Idolatry but the giving Divine honour to that which is not God, or prohibited honour to the true and only God? Theſe are things manifeſtly forbidden.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It's yet a groſſer Error, which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reaſon he gives for it, <hi>viz.</hi> That had God Commanded thoſe things, <hi>they had been a true Worſhip and acceptable.</hi> An aſſertion, Firſt, that confounds the Nature of things, that makes Vice and Vertue alike, and no otherwiſe diſcriminated but by Gods written Law, as if Idolatry and Superſtition were not Evil antecedent to all Revelation, and which are ſo where Revelation is not, as well as where it is.</p>

                           <hi>of our God, which (as we humbly conceive) leaves no more room for perfective than corruptive Additions to Divine Worſhip</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What can be an act of Obedience to God but what he hath commanded, whether he hath forbidden it or no? If we bid our Servant go a mile, and he goeth two (poſſibly hoping to do us Service in it) we hope his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Second mile is no act of obedience, though we did not forbid him. In matters of this Nature no act of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is allowable, becauſe it can be no obedience.</hi> In anſwer to which, it will be neceſſary to reſolve this Queſtion:</p>
                        <p>Q. <hi>Whether the doing of any thing in the Worſhip of God without a command be a ſinful addition to the Word of God?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer that if the Queſtion is underſtood of the proper and eſſential parts of Worſhip (if I may ſo ſpeak) then we grant it, and ſay, that he that ſhall inſtitute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in that kind without Divine Inſtitution, <hi>doth challenge Gods prerogative to himſelf;</hi> and becauſe <hi>the rule is ſufficient, all ſuch perfective are corruptive additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (as he ſpeaks) to both Rule and Worſhip. <hi>It is as if a Servant when bidden to go a mile, he goeth two (poſſibly hoping to do Service in it) for in matters of this nature no Supererogation is allowable.</hi> Thus far his compariſon holds, as to matters of the ſame Nature, and deſign'd to the ſame end: and eſteemed to be of the ſame uſe. As the going of two Miles for one, with an intent to do as good Service, and be as well if not better approv'd for ſo doing. But if the queſtion be underſtood of ſuch things as are Adjuncts to Divine Worſhip, that are not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:180"/> uſed upon the ſcore of any of the reaſons aforeſaid, then we are not to expect a command, nor do we Sin if we act without it. As for example, a Servant is required to go a Mile upon ſome ſervice, and he uſeth a Coat or a Cloak, takes an Horſe or goes on Foot, puts a ſtring about his Finger to remember him of what he is to do; Or if to carry a Meſſage, conſiders what to ſay, and Writes it down, that he may be the better fitted to deliver it; In ſuch caſes his Maſter would think him impertinent to ask Directions, and it's no Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence nor Supererogation to act, as he ſees fit, without them. And this is the caſe with us, as I ſhall afterward ſhew. This ſaid, there is way made for the next inference.</p>

                        <p>Suppoſe then we put it to the queſtion, Is Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone a ſufficient Rule for matters to be uſed in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God?

Yet for all this there muſt be a difference betwixt him and us, and ſomewhat ſhall be ſaid to make it out. For <hi>the Sufficiency of Scripture, is a very great argument.</hi> And ſo indeed it is; and it has been an old <note place="margin">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:181"/> or has not been ſo kind as to diſcover.</p>
                        <p>But however when all this is paſtover, he concludes as to one part, <hi>we cannot poſſibly agree with our R.

                        <p>Now let us conſider, what are the reaſons why he <hi>cannot poſſibly agree?</hi> Certainly if ever controverſie was like to be ended, we may now expect it, becauſe it's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout plain matter of Fact. But in this caſe he ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fails of performance: For whereas the deciding the caſe depends upon the compariſon betwixt the Law and the Goſpel, he doth not ſo much as offer any thing about the latter. But let us conſider what he ſaith of the former, and as much as we can, make up his defect in the latter. Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>As to Circumciſion, what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>

But was there nothing elſe <hi>determined?</hi> (as his cautious way of expreſſing it would imply) Let him conſult the Text, and he will find that the Creature was not only thus to be one <note place="margin">

And they were to eat it ſtanding (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor acknowledges p. 32.) with their loyns girt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And with ſeveral other rites too long to enumerate.</p>
                        <p>But in the Lord's Supper, there is nothing ſpecified or required but the Elements, and the breaking and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out; nothing ſaid of the kind of the Bread or Wine, nothing required of the time or poſture, or number, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I may confidently ſay it was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient if ſo they did, for God was pleas'd to require more (who is the moſt competent Judge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his own Law) For there was a particular preſcription not only as to the kinds of the Beaſts, but as to the diſpoſing and ordering of them in Sacrifice, what was to be eaten, and what not; whether the bloud ſhould be poured out or ſprinkled, whether upon the Altar or at the bottom of it, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> one would think that a perſon that talks ſo looſely of theſe things, had never read the Book of <hi>Leviticus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But now as to Prayers in the Chriſtian Church, we have only a general Form given us and direction to Pray in the Name of Chriſt, but nothing as to Words, Time, Poſture, Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that what can be more manifeſt then that there is no ſuch particular direction given in Worſhip, as they had under the law? And therefore however it comes to paſs that this Author hath here ſo bewildred himſelf, yet it's what he hath granted before, when he was fain to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as to things naturally neceſſary, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and of which he ſaith in the beginning of this argument, that <hi>for ſuch</hi>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:182"/> 
                           <hi>it is impoſſible there ſhould be a Rule;</hi> though there, I <note place="margin">

Had he ſaid in ſome not poſſible, in others not fit, he had been much more in the right: However (to let that paſs) in either way he grants that there is no expectation of Scripture-Authority for ſuch things, nor doth the ſufficiency of that or the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Chriſt ſuffer by ſuch an opinion.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe I may now cloſe this Argument: For, as for his <hi>Or's</hi> and, <hi>Alias's</hi> (which this Author ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon) I ſhall conſider them in another place.</p>

                           <hi>Body,</hi> &amp;c as oppoſed to Heavenly, or of the deſcription he gives of the ſtate of mankind, when he ſaith, <hi>we are by Nature Children of Wrath:</hi> We read of no <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph</hi> 2. 3.</note> ſuch Body or ſtate before the time of the Fig-leaves. And yet the Apoſtle makes bold to call them <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> as belonging to man in his preſent fallen State.</p>
                        <p>(2.) Therefore we have a further notion of <hi>Natural</hi> given us, and that is when any thing is ſuted to the Nature or State of the thing or perſon. Thus <hi>Ames</hi> and others tell us of <hi>Natural Ceremonies,</hi> as lifting up <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Freſh Suit p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. &amp;. 5.</note> the eyes to Heaven in Sign of Devotion, (which by the way is not ſo Natural; but that caſting them down <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke.</hi> 18. 13.</note> in Worſhip is a ſign of it too, as in the publicans.) And ſo <hi>habit</hi> is Natural to man, as belonging and ſuted to his preſent condition. But, ſaith he, it is not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, for a perſon may Pray naked;</hi> and ſo he may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:184"/> pray blindfold, and yet will any one ſay, ſight is not natural to man. But how may he pray naked in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious aſſemblies (for we are ſpeaking of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) can he ſay it's ſutable to the Solemnity? And ſo going naked is as little ſutable to the nature of man.</p>
                        <p>(3.) Again that's natural, which is the effect of Nature, though not born with us. And I am apt to think that did our Author live within the Circle of the Frigid Zone, he would without any Tutor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of what is <hi>the cuſtom of Civilized Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> without any moral reaſon, have thought upon the benefit of Frieze, or ſomewhat of the like uſe with that. But ſuppoſe I am miſtaken, how hath he mended the matter? He tells us, that <hi>by the cuſtom of Civilized Nations ſome habit is neceſſary.</hi> But then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 21.</note> of the Fig-leaves, what of the coats of Skins God clothed <hi>Adam</hi> with. Now to ſay it came from cuſtom before cuſtom was, (for it was in the beginning) I think, is much more abſurd than to ſay that Habit was natural.</p>
                        <p>But it's time to paſs on to a more profitable argument.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It was proved that all things, which in general and for kind are morally neceſſary are alſo lawful in their particulars. This was made evident from a parity of reaſon 'twixt what is naturally, and what is morally neceſſary, and therefore he that grants the particulars of what is naturally neceſſary, to be indifferent, muſt alſo grant the particulars of what is morally neceſſary to be indifferent. And as it follows this Time or that, this Place or that, this Habit or that is lawful and indifferent, becauſe Time, Place and Habit are neceſſary: So it alſo follows this Method or that, this Form or that, this Order or that is lawful, and may be uſed, becauſe Method, Form, and Order are neceſſary. And therefore we need look no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:184"/> more for an inſtitution for a Form, than, as he ſaith <hi>for a</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Bell to call to Worſhip, or for a Gown or Cloak to preach in,</hi> &amp;c. For what Naturally neceſſary is to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of its kind, that is Morally neceſſary to its particulars: And one is no more unlawful for want of an inſtitution or command, than the other. This our Author alſo yields to, <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having agreed</hi>

                           <hi>that there are ſome circumſtances of Humane actions, in Gods Worſhip, not only Natural, common to all actions, but of a Moral nature too, relating to them as ſuch actions, which God having neither commanded nor forbidden, may be uſed, are not much concerned, in what our Author ſaith upon his ſecond Head.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. It was further ſhewed in the aforeſaid Treatiſe, that ſuch things in Divine Worſhip as were agreeable to the Rules of the Apoſtle, and ſerved for Order, Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Edification, were alſo lawful, though they were neither Naturally nor Morally neceſſary; nor did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ariſe from the nature of the Thing, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do; that is, that there are a certain ſort of things that are ambulatory and contingent, that <note place="margin">

                        <p>This argument taken from Civil uſages our Author endeavours to avoid ſeveral ways.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He ſaith, <hi>If we do not miſtake, the reaſon why</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Ames <hi>and others do think that Civil uſages may be uſed in Acts of Worſhip, is becauſe they are either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the action, as Humane, or convenient, comely or grave,</hi> &amp;c. And becauſe I had ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things. pag.</hi> 14.</note> that if the being
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:185"/> Civil uſages did make them lawful in. Divine Worſhip, then there is nothing in Civil caſes but may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the Church, though never ſo abſurd, he ſaith, <hi>he cannot apprehend the conſequence,</hi> becauſe <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe examined, pag.</hi> 19.</note> what is granted about Civil uſages is to be applied to grave actions and none other. But to this I anſwer, Grant they are thus to be underſtood of ſuch <hi>Civil uſages</hi> as are <hi>grave,</hi> yet then it is not ſo much becauſe they are Civil, as becauſe they are grave, that they may be uſed, and provided that they were grave, they might be uſed if, they were not Civil, as well as if they were, and are not the ſooner to be uſed, becauſe they are Civil. And then what becomes of their argument for ſuch and ſuch practices and cuſtoms that they were Civil? And what have they got when to avoid the force of what we ſay from the Love-Feaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> plead, as he doth, that they are <hi>Civil uſages.</hi> So that when he and his brethren grant, <hi>that ſuch uſages which may ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>be uſed in other Humane actions of a grave nature, may be uſed in Acts of Worſhip</hi> (which is more than we dare ſay; for then ſtanding croſſes may be introduced into Worſhip, which are uſed to very grave purpoſes in Civil matters, as to diſtinguiſh Chriſtian from Heatheniſh or Turkiſh Dominions, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> I know not what they can deny.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He gives a very partial account of Civil uſages, when he tells us of <hi>Orators Pulpits,</hi> and <hi>Seats,</hi> and <hi>Bells, Gowns and Cloaks:</hi> But in the mean while forgets that there are Civil uſages, that are of a Ceremonial Nature, and that are uſed by way of ſignification, diſtinction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As now a garment is (I may ſtill ſay) Naturally or (as he will have it) Morally neceſſary, but when in a particular caſe it's required that it be White or Purple, it's a Civil uſage, and is by way of ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo the ſignification is transferr'd with it from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:185"/> a civil to a ſacred uſe, which how conſiſtent it is with their principles I leave it to his conſideration.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He takes no notice of the Argument uſed by me, that if civil uſages without inſtitution may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in Divine Worſhip, this (with his conceſſions before about Natural and Moral circumſtances) will juſtifie moſt, I had almoſt ſaid, all the practices of our Church, as I inſtanced in the Surplice, ſince White was uſed as a badge of Royalty and Dignity, of joy and innocency, in Civil caſes, and ſo may be uſed by <note place="margin">

All that he hath to ſay about the Surplice is, that <hi>it's tied to Worſhip,</hi> which is remote from the caſe in hand, and ſhall afterward be conſidered.</p>
                        <p>To this I may alſo add the Croſs, which he ſaith, <hi>they</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. It was further maintain'd in the ſtating of the Caſe, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe of Indiff.

                        <p>And yet (according to him) this muſt he do, that will undertake to prove, that things that are not comely, convenient, or edifying, may be admitted thereinto. For this Author tells us, that <hi>by Decency we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi>

                           <hi>he hath ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and expect till he hath juſtified all or any of the laſt Seven mentioned particulars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I ſhall not <hi>ſo lightly paſs over</hi> what he hath ſaid without clearing what may be cleared, and reducing the Caſe into its proper principles, though it be what he hath taken no care to explain or prove.</p>
                        <p>If we review his ſeven particulars, we ſhall find that the <note n="(a)" place="margin">V. caſe of a ſcrupulous Conſcience, Dr. Calamy's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on that ſubject.</note> 4th. and 6th. <note n="(b)" place="margin">the caſe of Symbolizing, and the defence.</note> belong not to this caſe, and are otherwhere reſolved: And of the Five remaining Four of them are reducible to one argument, which come now to be conſidered; and the laſt <hi>of Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> I ſhall treat upon in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>In treating upon the Four that belong to one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and have for their ſubject <hi>Human Acts;</hi> I think it may be done by putting and reſolving the following Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Q. <hi>What is it that doth make things in themſelves law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and indifferent, to be unlawful in Divine Worſhip?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the main ſeat of the controverſie; it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that there are indifferent things in the Worſhip of God; But ſince we afterward divide upon it, and ſay that notwithſtanding this there are ſome things of that nature, that are by circumſtance unlawful, it is fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how this Queſtion is reſolved by one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>If We ſtate the caſe, we ſay the Rules we are to guide our ſelves by, are thoſe of the Apoſtle, of Decency, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Edification. And we trouble not our ſelves nicely to conſider whether the Decency ariſe from the nature of the thing, or from common uſage, or preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or inſtitution, ſince we think that decency may ariſe from any, and it matters not from what cauſe the thing proceeds, nor how it came to be Decent, when it's now thought and found to be ſo. And as little curious arewe about the firſt reaſons of Order and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:187"/> for we are ſo little ſpeculative in matters of practice, that we think the peace of the Church, and Unity amongſt Chriſtians, are much more fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine us in theſe caſes than all the accuracy in Metaphyſicks.</p>
                        <p>So that if a thing be found to be decent, orderly and for Edification, though we were aſſur'd it did Spring from Humane Inſtitution, we think it to be lawful, and that Humane Inſtitution cannot make that unlawful; which is found by uſe and experience to be for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Order.</p>

                        <p>But (2.) If <hi>Preſcription,</hi> and <hi>Common Conſent,</hi> and <hi>the Guiſe of Countreys</hi> be the meaſure of Decency, may not theſe things alſo be the meaſure of it in the Church, and in things relating to Divine Worſhip? And is not <hi>the cuſtom of the Churches of God</hi> a reaſon as ſufficient to conclude us in this matter as the grave and Civil cuſtoms of a Nation? Or (3.) Is there any Church on this ſide <hi>Rome</hi> that by a <hi>Sic volo</hi> doth ſtamp a decency upon its Inſtitutions, without reſpect to preſcription and the cuſtom of Churches? Or that can do it? By his way of expreſſing himſelf, he would make the Argument great, as if to <hi>Create a Decency</hi> was an invaſion of God's Prerogative; <hi>We cannot apprehend it in the Power of man to Create a Decency. The greateſt Emperor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But if a Decency ariſe from <hi>the Guiſe of Countrys, and Preſcription, and Common Conſent,</hi> it might be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether according to him, God himſelf can then <hi>Create a Decency,</hi> and by his authority make that to be at once which requires time and Cuſtom (as he ſaith) to produce and form it? So high doth the power of a little School-ſubtilty and Imagination ſometimes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port men, that their Arguments vaniſh out of fight, and are loſt to all thoſe that converſe with what is groſs and tangible.</p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſing <hi>it is not in the power of man to Create a Decency,</hi> yet Order may be Order without thoſe dilatory reaſons of Cuſtom and Preſcription; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what holds againſt eſtabliſhing Decency by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, will not hinder but that order may be thereby eſtabliſhed. Therefore,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He further argues from the Nature of Decency and Order, that things of meer Humane Inſtitution are not capable of that plea. <hi>We can underſtand,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                           <hi>by orderly, and according to order, but without confuſion. By Decency we can underſtand nothing but what is oppoſed to ſordidly; nor can we think of any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is not Decent, if the contrary to it be not indecent. So then nothing ought to be done in the Worſhip of God, but what may be done without Confuſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of which Nature can nothing be that is idle and ſuperfluous,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I was at a great loſs at firſt to find out the drift of all this, but upon conſideration I think it contains theſe things: (1.) That it is unlawful to ordain or uſe any thing ſuperfluous in the Worſhip of God. (2.) That whatſoever is not for Order, Decency and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ſuperfluous. (3.) That nothing is Decent, if the contrary to it be not indecent. It's the laſt of theſe we are now concerned in; which by the help of the great managers of this Argument, may be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. <note place="margin">Ames<hi>'s Freſh Suit, &amp; anſwer to Bp.</hi> Morton. Jean's <hi>Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in anſwer to Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> And it amounts to this, that Decency and Indecency are contraries (rather privatives ſaith <hi>Jeans)</hi> And if one of them be not Indecent, the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Decent: And if the Action may be performed decently without what is called Decent, then that which we call ſo is not Decent. As ſuppoſe it's pleaded that a Surplice is Decent, but if the contrary be not Indecent, and the Service may be performed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently without it, then that Veſtment is not Decent.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to which I ſhall not concern my ſelf in a tedious and nice diſpute about the nature of Contrarieties and Privatives, but readily grant the oppoſition which they inſiſt upon betwixt Decent and Indecent; And yet notwithſtanding ſhall make bold to deny the whole they infer from it: And that for this reaſon, becauſe our Diſpute is not about the Nature of Decency and Indecency, but about things Decent and Indecent: And although Decency and Indecency be oppoſed as above ſaid, yet it is not ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:189"/> in the things controverted, but that things different may be both of them, Decent.</p>
                        <p>As for Example, he grants that <hi>it's comely and grave to preach in a Gown,</hi> and that they look therefore for <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 18.</note> no Inſtitution; but now by this way of arguing it could not be ſo: For if a perſon may preach decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without a Gown, then it cannot be Decent to preach with it, becauſe Decency and Indecency are contraries, and if the contrary be not Indecent, (as it is not to preach without it, muſt he ſay,) then to preach with it is not Decent.</p>
                        <p>So again, what Decency is to Indecency, that is Reverence to Irreverence: But, he ſaith, that kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sacrament is Decent, (for ſaith he, <hi>no</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Diſſenter refuſeth to receive the Sacrament kneeling becauſe it is not Decent)</hi> and <hi>Reverent.</hi> But it can be neither of theſe by his argument, for they alſo affirm that it may be Decently and Reverently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, though they do not kneel; and therefore the contrary to kneeling being not Indecent, kneeling cannot be Decent. And thus I might run on <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum;</hi> and the like may be argued from the account he gives of Order.</p>
                        <p>The ground of his and the others miſtake is, that they argue from the kind to the individuals of the kind, as if one individual was as much oppoſite to the other as kind to kind, whereas the individuals are mutable things, which the guiſe of Countrys, and cuſtom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alter; and two things different in uſe or figure, or the like, may be both of them Decent, as to wear a Cloak or a Coat in Secular buſineſs; a Cloak, Gown, or Surplice in Religious Solemnities, (according as the cuſtom is.)</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Brethren at the <hi>Savoy</hi> let this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Decent and orderly, when the oppoſite ſpecies is not undecent or diſorderly.</hi> And a greater than they ſaid <hi>it was comely,</hi> with reſpect to the then ſtate of the Church, <hi>not to marry,</hi> and yet without doubt it was <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 35.</note> not thought uncomely to marry too; which yet the Apoſtle could not have ſaid, if our Authors way of arguing had been of any force.</p>
                        <p>After all this pert diſcourſe againſt things inſtituted we are little concern'd, not only becauſe there is nothing like things meerly inſtituted by men in our Church except the Croſs, (which Lay-Communion is not concerned in) but alſo becauſe even that and all things that can be forced to look this way are not now inſtituting, but are received as having been ſo long before, and are not the ſubject matter of Inſtitution, but of Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Command betwixt which there is a vaſt difference, as, Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Againſt Dr.</hi> Hammond. <hi>pag.</hi> 80.</note> rightly obſerves; <hi>There is difference 'twixt Inſtitution, and Commandment or Appointment; for though every Inſtitution be a Commandment or Appointment, yet every Commandment or Appointment is not an Inſtitution.

                        <p>Nothing, though neceſſary, or convenient, or <note place="margin">

The People muſt kneel in the act of Receiving.</hi> What then? Why then they are unlawful Now how the things that are neceſſary in general (as Poſture, Habit, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> can be uſed without particulars, or how thoſe particulars can be uſed in Worſhip lawfully, and yet be unlawful, becauſe uſed in Worſhip, I underſtand not. For then ſitting would be unlawful, if alike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and a Gown be unlawful, and the Ring in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage unlawful, and the laying the hand on the Book unlawful, (at the former of which is a prayer annexed, and at the latter it is implied,) and all Civil Uſages in Worſhip would be unlawful: And then what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of what he hath elſewhere ſaid?

                        <p>But being ſenſible that this will not do, and that unleſs he can make the <hi>being uſed in Worſhip</hi> to be the ſame with Worſhip, to be an act or a part of it, he cannot make it unlawful, and that if he ſhould attempt it, it would be but to diſparage the cauſe, he makes a ſecond adventure.</p>

                        <p>1. From all which I infer, that neither <hi>David</hi> in deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor <hi>Nathan</hi> in approving what he deſign'd thought it abſolutely unlawful to do what was <hi>not commanded</hi> in the Worſhip of God, or that what was not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was forbidden. This muſt be granted by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that ſaith, <hi>God approved his generally good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> now what was his intention generally but to do ſomewhat in honour to God, and for the ſolemnity of his Worſhip? Thus much Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> doth yield, <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being pious, and the thing not forbidden by God,</hi> Nathan <hi>haſtily approves it.</hi> Now if he approved it <hi>becauſe not forbidden by God,</hi> then they did not think that what was not commanded, was forbidden; nor doth that of

                        <p>So that it appears that it was not unlawful for <hi>David</hi> to deſign a Temple nor unacceptable to God that he did deſign it, but it was deferr'd for the reaſons before given, and becauſe it was unſeaſonable.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe the Author has referr'd me to <hi>Ames,</hi> I will ſend him back thither, and let him ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has anſwered all this or no. <note place="margin">Ames <hi>Freſh Suit. part</hi> 2. §. 6, <hi>and</hi> 7. <hi>Caſe examined p.</hi> 26.</note>.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Feaſt of Purim,</hi> This Reverend perſon ſaith, <hi>It lieth upon our Author to prove, the Feaſt of purim was kept as a Religious Feaſt.

                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall therefore undertake to prove it a Religious Feaſt. But before I proceed I ſhall 1. obſerve, That the lawfulneſs of Religious Feaſts and Faſts admit of the ſame general proof, and if I prove one I prove the other. 2. I obſerve that the <hi>Jews</hi> did think it lawful to inſtitute Religious Feaſts and Faſts, both occaſional and anniverſary.

                        <p n="2">2.

                              <hi>On. c.</hi> 4. 16, <hi>and</hi> 9, 31.</note> But our Author ſaith; <hi>There is no order for any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Acts to be performed in it.</hi> As if they did not know what became them to do upon ſuch a gracious and wonderful deliverance. But we read of no order for ſuch Acts on their days of Faſting, were they not therefore Religious? Nay we read not of the name of God in the whole Book, or of any duty to him plainly expreſſed, and ſhall we therefore eſteem it not to be Religious and Canonical?</p>
                        <p>But ſaith our Author, <hi>If it were a Religious Feaſt, it was generally commanded under the precepts of giving thanks.</hi> And I deſire no more: For in one Breath he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:194"/> hath yielded all. So that now we have gained, that fixed and anniverſary feſtival days ſet apart for Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of God's Mercies to us, are not only lawful, but what we have a command for. And thence it follows, that a Church hath Power to determine them, as they did. And further that <hi>things not commanded</hi> may be uſed in Divine Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>The next thing is the Synagogal Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>To this he replyes, <hi>The Worſhipping of God in Synagogues wanted no ſpecial Command; Being but a Circumſtance convenient, if not neceſſary to publick Worſhip conſidered as an Humane Act. A Multitude of people could not meet to Worſhip God together without a fit place.</hi> But Firſt why did not Synagogues want <hi>a Special Command</hi> as well as the Temple <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>which he contends for?) For, which is worſe, to build a more convenient place for one already inſtituted, a Temple for a Tabernacle; or to build pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for which they had (as he yields) <hi>no ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> as the Synagogues? But ſuppoſe they needed not a Command for Synagogues, <hi>becauſe a Multitude could not meet together without a Fit Place;</hi> yet how will that be a reaſon that <hi>the Worſhipping in Synagogues wanted it not?</hi> That place is <hi>a circumſtance convenient,</hi> and that <hi>Synagogues were fit places for a Multitude of people to Worſhip in,</hi> we grant; and we will grant that this may be a reaſon to juſtify the building and uſing ſuch places <hi>without a ſpecial Command;</hi> yet what is that to the Worſhip ſo and ſo ordered in thoſe places? What is that to Days and Hours, which the Scripture ſpeaks of, and he contends againſt? What is this to the Forms uſed in their Service, which the Jews do write of?, If theſe are not to be juſtified though they wanted a Special Command, how was it that our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles did not only frequent the places, but the Service, as our Saviour's Cuſtomary Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:194"/> in them doth ſhew? What is this to the Ritual Obſervations our Saviour complied with, ſuch as the Paſſover Cup, and their poſture at it, which he ſhewed his approbation of in his taking the materials of his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from the Rites uſed in the Paſſover, <hi>as</hi> learned men have obſerved; of which <hi>Caſaubon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hoc primum obſervare juvat, quomodo Filius Dei umbras Legis ad veritatem traduxerit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This he will by no means hear of, and therefore uſeth ſeveral evaſions (for they are no better). Thus when it's recorded that our Saviour told the diſciples, <hi>with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire have I deſired to eat this Paſſover with you before I ſuffer:</hi> and in proſecution of it, that <hi>he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and ſaid, Divide it among your ſelves, for I will not Drink of the Fruit of the Vine.</hi> &amp;c. he irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently repreſents it as if it was no more than if he drunk only to ſatisfie Nature. For ſo he ſaith; <hi>Before Chriſt</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>did eat the paſchal Supper, he drank a Cup of Wine, and doubtleſs at it he drank alſo, though it be not recorded. People need no Inſtitution to drink while they are eating.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As if the Evangeliſt had no more to do than to tell us Chriſt drank a Cup of Wine with his Meat. Surely there is a better account to be given of this matter; The Text it ſelf ſhews it. And the Jewiſh Authors and others that write of their cuſtoms, do ſufficiently inform us. In which he muſt be very ignorant or incredulous, that will ſay (as he doth) that no more is ſignified by it than that <note place="margin">

                        <p>As for what he further ſaith, <hi>If the Jews did uſe one uniform poſture,</hi> &amp;c. there needs not many words to ſhew how precarious or falſe it is. For what more preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than to ſpeak doubtfully <hi>(If they did)</hi> of that which yet is clearly evident they did obſerve? Or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>if they did, it was becauſe they agreed it among themſelves,</hi> which is to ſuppoſe the reaſon of the thing to be certain, when the thing it ſelf according to him is uncertain? Or what more falſe ſince whether it was by agreement among themſelves, or by the Authority of the Church, that there was this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of poſture is not ſo certain, as it is that there was this Uniformity, and that they were univerſally obliged to uſe and obſerve it? For it was required that diſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biture ſhould be uſed in all Religious Feaſts, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the Paſſover by all without exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the firſt part of the Solemnity. For which I refer our Author <note place="margin">Lightfoot.</note> to one well-verſed in theſe matters.</p>
                        <p>So little Truth, or certainty is there in what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor aſſerts, that <hi>every one might uſe the poſture which was moſt convenient;</hi> and that <hi>there was no reaſon to conclude they would have ſhut out any from their paſchal Societies that deſired to eat it with his loyns girt,</hi> &amp;c. or ſtanding.</p>
                        <p>The next inſtance produced in the aboveſaid <hi>Caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things,</hi> and objected againſt by our Author, is the <hi>Hours of Prayer,</hi> which were obſerv'd amongſt the Jews, at Morning, Noon, and Evening.

                           <hi>uſed the hours of Prayer, which alſo they might have changed, if they had pleaſed. That the Jews ſent any to Goals, or excommunicated any for not keeping to thoſe hours we do not find. There is nothing of Religion in the time, more then in any other part of time. Thus St.</hi> Paul <hi>uſed Circumciſion and Purification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thus:</hi> How is that? Did the Apoſtles uſe the hours of Prayer onely <hi>as neceſſary circumſtances of Humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſuch without which the light of Nature, or Common uſage ſhews the thing cannot be done, or conveniently or</hi>

And not for his <hi>Thus,</hi> and the reaſons given by him? Will thoſe reaſons juſtifie thoſe very hours of the day, or the juſt number of three hours? Or however, how will they Juſtify the Prayers uſed at thoſe hours; But whatever exceptions he had againſt the time, he it ſeems found nothing to ſay to the Service, which yet was pleaded as well as that. <note place="margin">

                        <p>But he ſaith, <hi>There is nothing of Religion in the time.</hi> If ſo (as is granted) then it's in the power of a Church to inſtitute and determine it, where there is no other Religion in the Time, than as it's thus ſeparated to the Service of God.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly he ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles might have changed the Hours of Prayer, if they had pleaſed.</hi> How might they have changed them? Might they do it as Apoſtolical Perſons, or as Private Members of the Jewiſh Church? As to the former I find not they did exerciſe any ſuch Power within the Juriſdiction of the Jewiſh Church, nor that they had any Commiſſion ſo to do. As for the latter, I deny it. For if it lay in the power of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Members of a Church to alter the Hours in which the Church is to aſſemble, it is in their power to Diſſolve
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:196"/> the Aſſembly, and there could nothing but Confuſion iſſue from it. I muſt confeſs he ſeems to be at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loſs what to ſay as to this matter. And it appears ſo when he dares not ſo much as touch upon the Prayers uſed in thoſe hours, and applies his <hi>Thus</hi> to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> uſing <hi>Circumciſion and Purification,</hi> as if they alſo were <hi>neceſſary circumſtances of Humane action; or ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the light of Nature or Common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage ſhews the thing cannot be done,</hi> &amp;c. which were things of pure Inſtitution at the firſt, and what though peculiar to the Jewiſh Church, the Apoſtle complied with them in for a time.</p>

                        <p>It appears further they were not meerly Civil from the Character given to the kiſs of Charity, being
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:197"/> called the Holy Kiſs. But This was (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe the Apoſtle commanded Chriſtians to uſe it in a Sober, Temperate, Chaſt, Or holy manner.</hi> But if this was the reaſon, then all Kiſſes, and all Feaſts would be holy: But now Holineſs ſtamps ſomewhat peculiar upon the thing it's applied to, and ſignifies that by Some act, end, or uſe, it's Separated from the reſt of the ſame kind. And for this reaſon was it more likely the kiſs was called Holy, from its end, uſe and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (as it was a Teſtimony of that Holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire love, which was or ought to have been amongſt Chriſtians) rather than in reſpect of the manner; for what reaſon was there for that, when it was betwixt perſons of the ſame, and not a different, Sex. Beſides, if it was a meer Civil rite, and deſign'd for no Religious end, could we think the Apoſtle would require it, and cloſe his Epiſtles ſo frequently with it? Laſtly, it appears they were not uſed as mere Civil Rites, becauſe they were uſed in Religious Aſſemblies, and ſome of them annexed thereunto. Of this (he ſaith) <hi>he can never</hi>

It would have become our Author rather to have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the proofs given of this, than to call for more: which if he had conſidered he would have expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with more caution and reverence. That waſhing the Diſciples feet had a Spiritual ſignification, I have ſhewed, and ſo was not unfit for a Religious Solemnity; and that it was uſed in ſuch, the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 4. for a further account of which I leave him to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">

So that all that I affirmed was, there could be no Communion Lawful to ſuch as held it unlawful to communicate with a Church for the Sake of things uncommanded. And who are concerned in this, our Author very well knows; ſuch I mean, as plead this as an argument for their preſent Separation. But though the Aſſertion, as he words it, is neither mine, nor true; yet I dare affirm there are ſome things uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:198"/> which every particular Chriſtian muſt practiſe, or elſe he can be ſaid to have no Communion with the Churches where ſuch things are practiſed; Such are Forms of Prayer, and receiving the Sacrament in the Forenoon, and without ſitting, where there is no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made for them that would uſe that poſture, as well as where it is not allowed.</p>
                        <p>And this was the caſe in the ancient Churches. To which he replies, <hi>Their practices are great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and their writings depraved,</hi> or, <hi>it cannot be made appear, that none could have any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thoſe Churches, unleſs he did eat the Lord's Supper faſting, or prayed toward the Eaſt.</hi> That their writings are depraved is very true, But that they are ſo depraved as that there is nothing certainly theirs, is what no one will aſſert. And that they are not depraved in the paſſages or things I quoted from thence, is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the concurrence of the Fathers therein, and the general conſent of learned men of all ſides. As to what he ſaith that <hi>it doth not appear that none could have Communion with them, unleſs,</hi> &amp;c. It were eaſy to refute it, and to ſhew it in the Inſtances I gave; and to make it out in one for all, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>receiving the Lord's Supper Faſting;</hi> of which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Liquidò apparet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It plainly appears that our Saviour and</hi>

                        <p>Now when this was the practice (as they ſay) of the Univerſal Church, and that they ſo practiſed upon the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:198"/> ſcore of an Apoſtolical Precept, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> there ſaith, (how truly is not my buſineſs to enquire) can we think that it was not required? Or that there could be any Communion with thoſe Churches, if any did otherwiſe?

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:199"/> Which way ſoever he would be underſtood it's a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſtake.

                        <p>I proceeded further to ſhew that they themſelves could not then be Communicated with, ſince they do things without preſcription; as in adminiſtring the Sacraments, conceived Prayer, Swearing, and Church-Governments and order. He ſaith, <hi>we do not make Sitting neceſſary;</hi> but that is not the point in diſpute, for he by his principles ſhould ſhew where it is commanded. For conceived Prayer he argues, <hi>How this is preſcribed, he and others have been told elſewhere,</hi> and thoſe that have told it, have had a ſufficient anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Laying the hands on the Book, he ſaith, <hi>is a civil, no ſacred uſage;</hi> as if the invoking God, and a ſolemn te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our ſo invoking him by ſome external Rite, were meerly civil.

                        <p>As for the things relating to Church-order, he ſaith, <hi>Ten times more is allowed to matters of Government than Worſhip.</hi> But he undertakes not my argument taken from the parity of reaſon betwixt the Kingly and

                        <p>The Third general was to enquire, how we might <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> know what things are indifferent in the Worſhip of God. The main things he herein objects againſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Edification; In handling of which, he thus ſums up my ſenſe of it; <hi>Our Author would not have us judge of Edification from what moſt improveth Chriſtians in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                        <p>To this he ſaith ſeveral things. In Anſwer to which it will be convenient to give a clear repreſentation and ſtate of the Caſe, which I ſhall do in theſe Propoſitions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We muſt conſider that Edification is not the laying a Foundation, but a building upon it, and ſo there is not the ſame reaſon for the breaking Order for the ſake of Edification, as there is for the ſake of things abſolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and that which will warrant and doth oblige to the one, will not warrant nor oblige to the other. This will ſerve to ſhew the little force there is in what this Reverend Author confidently aſſerts, <hi>We know and are aſſured, that no man, to keep up any ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 34.</note> 
                           <hi>bounds</hi> (of Order,) <hi>ought to omit means by which he may improve his own Soul in the knowledge of Chriſt, or the exerciſe of his habits of Grace;</hi> by which aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his he makes Edification and improvement in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:200"/> knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as neceſſary as the knowledge of the Fundamentals of Religion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We muſt conſider (as I then obſerved) that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a means of Edification, and therefore if there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens <note place="margin">

                              <hi>Caſe examined. Pag.</hi> 35.</note> is againſt Edification, as he would have it underſtood.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We muſt obſerve that when there is a diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt means and means, the leſs is to give place to the greater, and what is moſt for Edification, is to yield to that which is leaſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That for that reaſon the Edification of the Church, and the welfare of the whole is to be prefer'd before the ſpiritual advantage of any particular member; for what the leſs is to the greater, that is a member to the Church; and if a perſon cannot ſerve and improve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without damage to the Publick, he is rather to ſit down without that improvement, than to do miſchief to the Community for the obtaining it; And as long as he is not without means ſufficient for Salvation, he is in that Caſe to recede from ſome further attainments; in doing which, for ſo good an end, <hi>he is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</hi> So that however our Author may <note place="margin">

                           <hi>cannot conceive how it is poſſible that in things of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, things of an Indifferent nature ſhould be the matter of any human determination;</hi> and again, that <hi>in matters of Worſhip, no Superiours may reſtrain, what God hath left at liberty.</hi> We are not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Firſt Queſtion, for our buſineſs was to conſider not ſo much the extent of our Superiours pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in what Caſes they may lawfully command, as in what we may lawfully obey. But yet becauſe he hath herein offered ſomewhat like an Argument, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the clearing of this will make way for the Second, I ſhall take it into conſideration.

For, (1.) The Caſe was then determined, it was indeed a Lamb or a Kid, but ſo as no other Beaſt, a Turtle or a Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſo as no other bird was to be uſed inſtead of them.</p>
                        <p>But now though there is the <hi>Or</hi> under the Goſpel, yet it is without ſuch reſtraint, for ours is free through the whole kind, and nothing determines us, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy to the general rules. It's ſo an <hi>Or</hi> and an <hi>Aliàs,</hi> that nothing of the kind is excepted. So ſaith our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf; <hi>In Prayer God hath left ſtanding, ſitting or</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 30.</note> 
                           <hi>kneeling, to our choice and conveniency,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He hath left us at liberty what words to uſe, what method or order to obſerve,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) As the disjunction was then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſo the very disjunction it ſelf was of Divine inſtitution, and the liberty they had to chooſe one of the two, as well as the reſtraint of not chooſing any but one of the two, was from the ſpecial Law of God. And then for Authority to have determined what God had left free, had ſome ſhew of <hi>controulment of the Divine Wiſdom;</hi> eſpecially if it had been required (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſomewhere ſuppoſeth) that they ſhould <hi>never have</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>offer'd</hi> any other but one ſort of them. But under the Goſpel it is otherwiſe, for the disjunction, the <hi>Or</hi> and the <hi>Aliàs,</hi> doth not proceed from Divine Inſtitution, but from the nature of things, and ſometimes from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Art and Contrivance. As when Waſhing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, (for I ſhall not contend about it) all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are comprehended, and the perſon might be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:202"/> dipped or ſprinkled, or have water poured on him, as he obſerves; ſo in receiving the Sacrament, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 22.</note> of the Primitive Church (not of meer ſtanding, as he miſtakes me, but) of ſtanding (as I ſaid) by way <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 35.</note> of incurvation; or ſitting, or kneeling, are all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the general ſpecies of poſture. Again ſometimes this <hi>Or</hi> and <hi>Aliàs</hi> proceeds from human Art and Contrivance, hence the diverſity of habits, as a Gown, Cloak, Surplice. Now when this disjunction doth proceed not from Divine Inſtitution, but from the reaſons aforeſaid, and that there is no ſpecial Command of God to interpoſe, determine, reſtrain, or disjoyn, it can be no <hi>controulment</hi> of the Wiſdom or Authority of God for a Church to interpoſe, reſtrain, or determine theſe matters in his Worſhip. This is plain in the Caſe of Meats and Drinks, in which under the Law there was a reſtraint, an <hi>Or</hi> and <hi>Aliàs,</hi> This and not That, and there is ſtill an <hi>Or</hi> ariſing from the nature of theſe things, and yet a determination or reſtraint herein is no <hi>controulment of the divine Wiſdom,</hi> as it might have been under the Law, becauſe there is no Inſtitution that doth interpoſe: And the Caſe muſt be the ſame in Divine Worſhip, in which ſince there is no Inſtitution about theſe matters, it's no ſin to Act in the ſame way; that is, it's no ſin for Authority to limit and determin, and for others to be limited, and determined; which brings me to the next Queſtion.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As to the former, I only ſay (and that's enough) that Nature teacheth us and doth oblige us to part with ſome of our liberty in Communities: And they are far from being required to <hi>part with all</hi> in ours, and ſo if his argument have any thing in it, it hath nothing in it as to our Caſe.</p>
                        <p>For the Second, I leave him to what was ſaid by way <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe of Indiff. Things, p.</hi> 46.</note> of prevention, in the Tract he oppoſeth, and which he ſhould have Anſwered before he had made uſe of this as an Argument.</p>
                        <p>All that he hath excepted againſt upon that ſubject is the notion I laid down of Chriſtian Liberty, which I ſaid was no other than the Liberty which mankind had, before it was reſtrained by particular Inſtitution, and he gives this reaſon againſt it, <hi>For in that [viz.</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe Exam. p.</hi> 40.</note> Liberty] <hi>we muſt not ſtand faſt, becauſe Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution hath reſtrained us in it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>neither hath Chriſt reſtored us to any ſuch Liberty.</hi> In Anſwer to this I ſhall conſider what Natural Liberty is, and then what Liberty it is that the Apoſtle did treat of? As to the Former, it's no other but the free uſe or diſuſe of things Indifferent, whether out of, or in the Worſhip of God. As to the Latter, it was no other than a freedom from the Jewiſh <hi>yoke of bondage,</hi> and that Law that <hi>gendred</hi> to it, as the whole current of the Apoſtles diſcourſe doth ſhew. And therefore it could be with reſpect to no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52190:203"/> other condition than that which mankind would have been, had there been no ſuch particular Inſtitution, and was in before that Inſtitution. 'Twas the nature of the Law, and the injoining of it by divine Inſtitution, ſo as it became neceſſary to them, that made it a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and a <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 18.</note> Yoke intolerable, and it was a freedom from that Law that conſtitutes the Liberty which the Apoſtle treats of in that Epiſtle: And if it be alſo to be taken as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have it <hi>for a freedom, in matters of Worſhip, from any thing but what is of Divine Inſtitution,</hi> that is a ſecondary ſenſe, and which may be taken from ſome parity of reaſon betwixt Caſe and Caſe, but is not the Apoſtles, nor the primary ſenſe of it. But take it how we will in this or the other, I there ſhewed that the Apoſtles exhortation was of no uſe to them that <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. Pag.</hi> 47.</note> plead it againſt ſubmiſſion to Authority in Indifferent Things, when impoſed in or about Divine Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>I am now come to the laſt general head of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Tract, which contained a ſhort account of the things required in our Church, as they were either Duty or Indifferent. And for an inforcement of that, and concluſion of the whole, I ſhall briefly ſhew how far this Reverend Author conſents to, or by his conceſſions muſt be bound to acknowledge it. Indeed he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth tell us, that <hi>Nine parts of Ten of all Diſſenters ſay they cannot comply with things required in the</hi> Engliſh <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caſe Examin. pag.</hi> 3. 36. 38.</note> 
                           <hi>Liturgy, becauſe they believe the things ſinful and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>Two hardly of an Hundred</hi> think them Indifferent: But whether our Author be of that number, or at leaſt has reaſon ſo to be, I ſhall leave to his own conſcience, as to himſelf, and to his conceſſions as to others. In which I ſhall obſerve the method taken in the aforeſaid Tract, where I ſaid all things objected againſt, might be refer'd to Poſture, Forms, and Times, and ſhew'd theſe to be Natural or Moral circumſtances
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52190:203"/> of Action, and inſeparable from it. Now in general he grants what are ſuch <hi>may be lawfully uſed;</hi> And if we <note place="margin">

                        <head>A DISCOURSE OF CONSCIENCE: With Reſpect to thoſe that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> upon the Pretence of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THere is nothing more in our Mouths than <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> and yet there are few things we have generally taken leſs Pains to underſtand. We ſit down too often with this, that it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>within us,</hi> we do not know what, which we are to Obey in all that it Suggeſts to us, and we trouble our ſelves no further about it.</p>
                        <p>By which means, it frequently comes to paſs; that though we have eſpouſed very dangerous Errors, or happen to be ingaged in very Sinful Practices; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and Acting, as we ſay, according to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; we do not only think our ſelves perfectly Right and Safe, while we continue in this State; but are Effectually Armed againſt all ſorts of Arguments, and Endeavours that can be uſed for the bringing us to a better Mind.</p>
                        <p>This is too Viſible in many Caſes; but in none more than in the Caſe of thoſe that at this Day Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:208"/> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>the Church</hi> as it is Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us. Though the Laws of the Land both <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> do oblige them to joyn in our Communion; though many Arguments are offer'd to convince them, not only that they Lawfully may, but that they are bound to do it: though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſenſible, that many-fold, and grievous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and dangers, do enſue from this breach of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and theſe unnatural Diviſions, both to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in General, and to our <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in particular, yet if to all theſe things, a Man can reply, that he is <hi>Satisfied</hi> in his <hi>Conſcience</hi> that he doth well in refuſing his Obedience to the Laws; or that he is <hi>not ſatisfied in his Conſcience</hi> that he ought to joyn with us upon ſuch Terms as are required; this ſingle pretence ſhall be often thought a ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, both to Laws, and Arguments.</p>
                        <p>A ſtrange thing this is; that <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ends, was given to Mankind for a Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, and Security of the Publick Peace; for the more Effectually Obliging Men to Unity, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Laws; yet ſhould often be a means of ſetting them at diſtance, and prove a Shelter for Diſobedience, and Diſorder: That God ſhould Command us to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey our Governours in all Lawful things for Conſcience ſake, and yet that we ſhould Diſobey them in Lawful things for Conſcience ſake too.</p>
                        <p>It is the Deſign of this Diſcourſe to examine what there is in this Plea, that is ſo often made by our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters for their not complying with the Laws, <hi>viz. That it is againſt their Conſcience ſo to do;</hi> and to ſhew in what Caſes this Plea is juſtly made, and in what Caſes not; and where it is Juſtly made, how far it will Juſtify any Mans Separation, and how far it will not. And all this in order to the poſſeſſing thoſe who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:208"/> are concerned, with a Senſe of the great Neceſſity that lyes upon them, of uſing their moſt ſerious endeavours to inform their Conſcience aright in theſe matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prefume to think they can Separate from us with a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> which is all we deſire of them; for it is not our buſineſs to perſwade any Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form againſt his Conſcience; but to convince every Man how Dangerous it <hi>may be to follow a miſinformed Conſcience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before I enter upon this diſquiſition, it will be neceſſary in the firſt Place, to prepare my way by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Grounds, and Principles, I mean to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon. And here that I may take in all things, that are needful to be known before-hand, about this matter, I ſhall treat diſtinctly of theſe Five Heads.</p>
                        <list>

                           </item>
                           <item>2 Of the <hi>Rule of Conſcience.</hi> And under that,</item>
                           <item>3 Of the <hi>Power of Humane Laws to Oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4 And particularly in <hi>the inſtance of Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>5 Of the <hi>Authority of Conſcience;</hi> or <hi>how far a Man is Obliged to be guided by his Conſcience in his Actions.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p n="1">I. And firſt, as for the <hi>Nature</hi> of Conſcience, the trueſt way to find out that will be, not ſo much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Signification of the word <hi>Conſcience</hi> or the ſeveral <hi>Scholaſtical</hi> Definitions of it; as to conſider what every Man doth really mean by that word when he has occaſion to make uſe of it; for if it do appear that all Men do agree in their Notions, and Senſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter; That without doubt, which they all thus agree in, is the true Notion, and Senſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as to this, we may oberve in the firſt Place, that a Man never ſpeaks of his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:209"/> reſpect to <hi>his own Actions,</hi> or to ſomething that hath the Nature of an Action which is done or omitted by him, or is to be done or omitted, Matters of <hi>meer Knowledg,</hi> and Speculation, we do not concern our Conſcience with; as neither with thoſe things in which we are <hi>purely Paſſive;</hi> as neither with <hi>Actions,</hi> if they be not <hi>our own.</hi> We do not for inſtance, make it a Point of Conſcience one way or other, whether a thing be true or falſe; or whether this or the other Accident that befals us, be proſperous or unfortunate; or whether another Man hath done good or bad Actions, in which we are no way concerned. Theſe kind of things may indeed prove matters of great Satisfaction or Diſquiet; of Joy or Grief to us: But we do not take our <hi>Conſcience</hi> to be affected with them. That word never comes in, but with reſpect to ſomething willingly done or left undone by us; or which we may do or may forbear.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we may obſerve that in Common Speech, we do not neither uſe this word Conſcience about our Actions, but only, ſo far as thoſe Actions fall under a <hi>Moral</hi> conſideration; that is, as they have the Nature of <hi>Duties</hi> or <hi>Sins,</hi> or as they are <hi>Lawful</hi> or <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> Always when we ſpeak of Conſcience in our Actions, we have reſpect to ſome <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi> by which thoſe Actions are to be directed, and govern'd, and by their agreeableneſs or diſagreeableneſs with which they become morally <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this being ſo; the only thing remaining to be enquired into for the finding out what Conſcience is, is, what can be reaſonably thought to be our Senſe, and meaning, when we uſe the word <hi>Conſcience,</hi> with ſuch Application to our <hi>Actions</hi> as we have now ſaid. Now for that I deſire it may be conſidered; that when we talk of our <hi>Actions</hi> as we concern our Conſcience
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:209"/> in them, they can but fall under theſe two Heads of Diſtinction, that is to ſay, in the firſt place, we either conſider our Actions as <hi>already done or omitted:</hi> or we conſider them as <hi>yet not done, but as we are deliberating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them.</hi> And then Secondly, whether we conſider them as done or not done; as paſt, or future; yet we Rank them under one of theſe three Notions.</p>
                        <p>We either look upon them as <hi>Commanded</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> and ſo to be <hi>Duties;</hi> or as <hi>forbidden</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> and ſo to be Sins; or as <hi>neither Commanded nor forbidden,</hi> and ſo to be <hi>indifferent</hi> Actions. (With theſe laſt Actions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Conſcience is not properly or directly concerned, but only by accident, to wit, as thoſe indifferent <hi>Actions</hi> do approach to the Nature of Duties or Sins:) Our Actions, I ſay, do not touch our Conſcience, but as they fall under ſome of theſe Heads.</p>
                        <p>Now in all theſe Reſpects we have indeed different ways of bringing in Conſcience but yet as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we mean the ſame thing by it in them all. Firſt of all when we are conſidering an Action <hi>as yet not done;</hi> if we look upon it as <hi>Commanded</hi> by God, we ſay we are <hi>bound in Conſcience</hi> to do it; if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a <hi>Sinful</hi> Action, we ſay it is <hi>againſt our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to do it; if we look upon it as an <hi>indifferent</hi> thing, we ſay we may do it or not do it with a <hi>Safe Conſcience.</hi> Now I pray, what do we mean by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions? I deſire that every one would conſult his own Mind, and deny if he can, that this is the Senſe of his words. If he ſaith he is <hi>bound in Conſcience</hi> to do this or the other thing, whether he doth not mean this? that he verily thinks it is his Duty to do that Action. If he ſaith that it is <hi>againſt his Conſcience</hi> to do ſuch an Action; whether he means any more than this? that he is perſwaded in his Judgment that to do ſuch an Action is an Offence againſt God. If he ſaith
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:210"/> that he can do it with a <hi>Safe Conſcience</hi> whether he hath any other meaning than this? that to the beſt of his Knowledg, and Judgment, the Action may be done without Tranſgreſſing any Law of God. This is now undeniably, the Senſe that every Man in the World hath, when he makes mention of Conſcience as to Actions that are not yet done, but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his Conſideration. So that taking Conſcience as it reſpects our <hi>Actions</hi> to be done or omitted, and as it is to Govern, and Conduct them (in which Senſe we call Conſcience a Guide or a Monitor, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though very improperly, a <hi>Rule</hi> of our Actions) it can be nothing elſe in the Senſe of all Men that uſe that word, but a Mans Judgment concerning the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or badneſs; the Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of Actions in order to the Conduct of his own Life.</p>
                        <p>But Secondly if we ſpeak of our Actions that are done and paſt, and conſider Conſcience with Reference to them; here indeed we do a little vary the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion about Conſcience, but the Notion of it is the ſame we have now given. As for inſtance, when we talk of <hi>Peace of Conſcience,</hi> or <hi>Trouble of Conſcience,</hi> with Reference to ſome Action we have done or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; when we ſay <hi>My Conſcience bears me Witneſs,</hi> that I have Acted rightly, and honeſtly in this Affair; or my Conſcience acquits me from blame, as to this or the other Action; or I am troubled in Conſcience for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I have done: If we turn theſe Phraſes into other words, we ſhall find that there is nothing more at the bottom of them than this; that reflecting upon our own Actions, we find that in this or the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we have either Acted or omitted, as we are convinced in our Judgment we ought to do; and the remembrance of this is ſome Pleaſure, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to us: or we have done or forborn ſomething
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:210"/> contrary to what we take to be our Duty; and the remembrance of this affects us with grief and trouble. But ſtill, in both theſe inſtances of Expreſſion, that which we mean by Conſcience is the ſame thing, as in the former Caſes, <hi>viz. It is our Judgment and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion concerning what we ought to do, or ought not to do, or Lawfully may do;</hi> only here we add to it this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that the Action which we are perſwaded to be good, or bad, or indifferent, is now done or omitted by us, and we do remember it. In the Former Caſe, Conſcience was conſidered as the Guide of our Actions. In the latter Caſe it is conſidered as the Witneſs of our Actions. But in both Caſes, Conſcience is the Judge, and conſequently in both Caſes the Notion of it is the ſame, only with this difference, that in the former it was a Mans mind, making a Judgment what he ought to do or not to do; in the latter it is a Mans mind reflecting upon what he hath done or not done, and Judging whether he be Innocent or Culpable in the matter he reflects upon.</p>
                        <p>I do not know how to give a clearer account of the Nature of Conſcience in general than this I have now given. This I believe is the Natural Notion that all Men have of it, and there is no Expreſſion in Scripture about it but what doth confirm this Notion. If indeed we put Epithites to Conſcience, and talk of a Good Conſcience or an Evil Conſcience; A Tender Conſcience or a Seared Conſcience or the like. Then it includes more, both in Scripture, and in Common Language, than I have now mentioned. But to give an account of thoſe things I am not now concerned, as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Limits of our preſent enquiry.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And now we are ſufficiently prepared for our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond general Point which is touching the <hi>Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi>
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:211"/> if indeed after what we have already ſaid it be not ſuperfluous to inſiſt upon that.</p>
                        <p>It appears plainly by what I have repreſented, that Conſcience muſt always have a <hi>Rule</hi> which it is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and by which it is to be Govern'd. For ſince Conſcience is nothing elſe but a Mans <hi>Judgment</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Actions, as good, or bad, or Indifferent;</hi> it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that a Man muſt have ſome meaſures to proceed by in order to the framing ſuch a Judgment about Actions; that is to ſay, there muſt be ſomething di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Man himſelf that makes Actions to be good, or bad, or indifferent; and from which, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying particular Actions to it, or comparing them with it, a Man may be able to Judge whether they be of the one ſort or the other. Now this, whatever it be, is that which we call the Rule of Conſcience; and ſo much it is its Rule, that <hi>Conſcience</hi> can be no farther a ſafe guide than as it follows that Rule.</p>
                        <p>If now it be asked what this Rule of Conſcience is, or what that is which makes a difference between Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to the Moral goodneſs or badneſs of them; the Anſwer to it is Obvious to every Body: That it can be nothing elſe but the <hi>Law of God.</hi> For nothing can be a <hi>Duty</hi> but what Gods Law hath made ſo; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be a <hi>Sin</hi> but what Gods Law hath forbidden (the very Notion of Sin being, that it is a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law;) and laſtly we call a thing <hi>Lawful</hi> or <hi>Indifferent</hi> upon this very account, that there is no Law of God either Commanding or Forbidding it; and where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion. So that undeniably the great, nay I ſay, the only Rule by which Conſcience is to be Governed is the <hi>Law of God, conſidered either as it Commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Actions, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them, or as it neither Commands them nor Forbids them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:211"/>
                        <p>But in order to the giving a more diſtinct account, of this <hi>Rule of Conſcience,</hi> there is this needful to be enquired into, <hi>viz.</hi> In what Senſe we take, or what we mean by the <hi>Law of God;</hi> when we ſay it is the <hi>Rule of Conſcience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to this our Anſwer is, That by the <hi>Law</hi> of God, we here underſtand Gods Will, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mens Actions, in what way ſoever that Will is declared to them.</p>
                        <p>Now the will of God is declared to Men two ways; either by <hi>Nature,</hi> or by <hi>Revelation;</hi> ſo that the juſt, and, adequate Rule of Conſcience is made up of two parts the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Gods Revealed Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> we mean thoſe Principles of Good and Evil, Juſt and Unjuſt, which God hath Stamp'd upon the Minds of all Men, in the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their Natures. There are ſome things E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally good in themſelves; Such as to Worſhip God, to Honour our Parents, to ſtand to our Covenants, to Live Peaceably in the Government, from which we receive Protection; and the contrary to theſe will be Eternally Evil; the Heads of all which things thus good in themſelves, are writ ſo plainly, and <hi>Legibly,</hi> in the Minds of Mankind, that there is no Man who is come to the uſe of his Reaſon, but muſt of neceſſity be convinced, that to Practice theſe things will alway be his Duty, and not to Practice them, will always be Evil, and a Sin. Now all theſe Heads, and Principles put together, is that we call the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and this is all the Rule of Conſcience, that Mankind had, before God was pleaſed to diſcover his Will by more particular <hi>Revelation.</hi> And this is that Law, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of when he ſaith <hi>that the Gentiles, who had not the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>yet had a Law written in their Hearts;</hi> by their Acting according to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:212"/> which, or contrary to which <hi>their Conſcience did bear Witneſs to them,</hi> and did either <hi>Accuſe</hi> them, or <hi>Excuſe</hi> them.</p>
                        <p>But then Secondly, to us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> God to this <hi>Law of Nature</hi> hath ſuperadded a <hi>Revealed Law,</hi> which is contained in the Books of Holy Scriptures. Which Revealed Law yet, is not wholly of a different kind from the former, nor doth it at all void the Obligation of it. But only thus; God hath in his Revealed Law, declared the Precepts of the Law of Nature, more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and accurately than before; He hath given greater Force, and Strength to them, than they had before, by the Sanctions of greater Rewards, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: He hath likewiſe herein perfected the Law of Nature, and hath Obliged us, in point of Duty, to more and higher Inſtances of Vertue, than Nature did ſtrictly Oblige us to: And Laſtly, He hath added ſome Poſitive Laws for us to obſerve which were not at all contained in the Law of Nature, as for inſtance, to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in order to Salvation, to make all our Applications to God, in the Name of that Mediatour <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> to enter into a <hi>Chriſtian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and to Exerciſe <hi>Communion</hi> with that Society, by partaking of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this is that Law, which we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to, as well as to the Law of our Natures, and which as it is a Summary of all the Laws of Nature, ſo indeed is it a Summary of all our Duty. So that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man will call it the great, or only <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conſcience,</hi> I ſhall not much oppoſe him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that this be always Remembred, that,</p>
                        <p>In the Third Place, when we ſay that the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Revealed</hi> Law of God, is the juſt <hi>Rule,</hi> by which we are to Govern our Conſcience, or when we ſay that the Law of God, as Revealed, and contained in the Bible, is to us Chriſtians, the <hi>juſt Rule.</hi> We are ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:212"/> to underſtand this Propoſition as to take into it, not only all that is directly, and expreſly Commanded, or Forbidden by either of thoſe Laws: But alſo all that by plain Collection of Right Reaſon in Applying Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals to Particulars, or comparing one thing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth appear to be Commanded or Forbidden by them.</p>
                        <p>So that by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> as it is a Rule of Conſcience, we are not only to underſtand the prime Heads, and moſt general Dictates of it, (which are but a few) but alſo all the neceſſary Deductions from thoſe Heads. And by the <hi>Law of Scripture,</hi> as it is the Rule of Conſcience, we are not only to underſtand the expreſs Commands, and Prohibitions, we meet with there, in the letter of the Text; but all the things likewiſe, that by unavoidable Conſequence do follow from thoſe Commands, or Prohibitions. In a word, when we are deliberating with our ſelves, concerning the goodneſs, or badneſs; the Lawfulneſs, or Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this, or the other particular Action: We are not only to look upon the letter of the Law, but to attend further to what that Law may be ſuppoſed by a Rational Man to contain in it. And if we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the Action we are deliberating about, is Commanded, or Forbidden, by direct <hi>Inference,</hi> or by <hi>Parity of Reaſon;</hi> we ought to look upon it as a Duty, or a Sin, though it be not expreſly <hi>Commanded,</hi> or <hi>Forbidden,</hi> by the Law, in the letter of it. And if neither by the letter of the Law; nor by Conſequence from it; nor by Parity of Reaſon; the Action before us, appear either to be Commanded, or Forbidden: In that Caſe, we are to look upon it, as an indifferent Action; which we may do, or let alone, with a ſafe Conſcience; or, to expreſs the thing more properly, we are to look upon it as an Action in which our <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as our <hi>Prudence.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p n="3">III. Having thus given an account of the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that which Naturally follows next to be conſidered, with Reference to our preſent deſign, is, <hi>what ſhare Humane Laws have in this Rule of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi> whether they be a part of this Rule, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bind a Mans Conſcience to the Obſervance of them or no? which is our Third general Head.</p>
                        <p>Now as to this, our Anſwer is, that though the <hi>Laws of God</hi> be the great, and indeed the only Rule of Conſcience, yet the <hi>Laws of Men,</hi> generally ſpeaking, do alſo bind the Conſcience, and are a part of its Rule in a <hi>Secondary</hi> Senſe, that is, by Vertue of, and in Subordination to the Laws of God.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall briefly explain the meaning of this, in the Four following Propoſitions.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, there is nothing more certain than that the <hi>Law of God, as it is declared both by Nature, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth Command us, to Obey the Laws of Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no one Dictate of Nature, more Obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us, than this, that we are to Obey the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we Live under, in all honeſt, and Juſt things. For this is indeed the Principal Law, and Foundation of all Society. And it would be impoſſible, either for Kingdoms, or States; for Citys, or Families to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; or at leaſt to maintain themſelves in any Toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of Peace, and Happineſs, if this be not acknowledged a Duty.</p>
                        <p>And then, as for the Laws of God in Scripture, there is nothing more plainly declared there, than, that it is Gods Will, and our Duty to <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over us;</hi> and to <hi>Submit our ſelves to every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man, for the Lords ſake, and to be Subject not only for Wrath but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> So that no Man can doubt that he is really bound in Duty to Obey the Laws of Men that are made by Juſt, and Sufficient Authority. And Conſequently no Man can doubt that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:213"/> Humane Laws do really bind the Conſcience, and are one part of the Rule by which it is to be directed, and Governed.</p>
                        <p>But then having ſaid this, we add this farther in the Second Place, that <hi>Humane Laws do not bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by any Vertue in themſelves; but meerly by Vertue of Gods Law, who has Commanded that we ſhould in all things be Subject to our Lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> Conſcience is not properly concerned with any Being in the World, ſave God alone, it hath no Superiour but him: For the very Notion of it, as I have often ſaid, is no other than <hi>our Judgment, of what things we are bound to do by Gods Law; &amp; what things we are Forbidden to do by Gods Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that all the Men in the World, cannot bind any Mans Conſcience, by Vertue of any Power, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that is in them: But now God having made it an everlaſting Law, both by <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> that we ſhould Obey thoſe who are ſet over us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be our <hi>Parents,</hi> or our <hi>Maſters;</hi> and much more our <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Soveraign Legiſlative Power,</hi> under whom we Live; by Vertue of this Command of God, and this only; we are for ever bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to Govern our Actions, by the Commands, that they impoſe upon us; and thoſe Commands of theirs are a Rule, (though a <hi>Conſequential,</hi> or a <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi> Rule,) by which we are to Govern our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe they are the Inſtances of our Obedience to the Laws of God.</p>
                        <p>But then in the Third Place, this is alſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered; that <hi>Humane Laws do no farther bind the Conſcience, and are a Rule of it, than as they are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Laws of God.</hi> If any Law, or Command of Man, do Claſh with any Law of God; that is, if it be either Evil in it ſelf, or Contradictory to the Duty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:214"/> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as laid down in the Scriptures; in that Caſe, that Law or Command, by what Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſoever it was made or given, doth not bind our Conſcience, nor is any Rule of our Actions. On the contrary we are not at any Rate to yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it; but we are here reduced to the Apoſtles Caſe, and muſt Act as they did; that is, we <hi>muſt Obey God, rather than Men,</hi> and we Sin, if we do not. For ſince God only hath proper, and direct Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Conſcience, and Humane Power, only, by Delegation from him: And ſince God hath not given any Commiſſion to the moſt Soveraign Princes upon Earth, to alter his Laws, or to impoſe any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Subjects, that is inconſiſtent with them. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows by neceſſary Conſequence, that no Man can be Obliged to Obey any Laws of Men, farther than they are agreeable to, and conſiſtent with the Laws of God.</p>
                        <p>There is yet a Fourth thing, neceſſary to be taken in for the clearing the Point we are upon, and that is this, That though Humane Laws, generally ſpeaking, may be ſaid to bind the Conſcience, and to be a part of its Rule: Yet we do not Aſſert that every <hi>Humane Law,</hi> (though it doth not interfere with any of Gods Laws) <hi>doth at all times, and in all Caſes, Oblige Every Mans Conſcience to Active Obedience to it;</hi> ſo as that he Sins againſt God, if he Tranſgreſs it. No, it would be a very hard thing to affirm this; and I do not know what Manamong us, upon theſe Terms, would be Innocent.</p>
                        <p>Thus much I believe we may ſafely lay down as a Truth; That where either the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Law is of ſuch a Nature; that the Publick, or ſome private Perſon ſhall Suffer Damage, or Inconvenience, by our not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it. Or Secondly, Though the Law, as to the <hi>matter</hi> of it be never ſo Trifling, nay, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:214"/> all things conſidered, it be an inconvenient Law; yet if the <hi>Manner</hi> of our not Obeying it, be ſuch, as gives <hi>Offence</hi> to our Superiours, or to any others; that is, either Argues a <hi>Contempt</hi> of Authority, or ſets an ill <hi>Example</hi> before our fellow Subjects: I ſay in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Caſes, the Tranſgreſſion of a Humane Law, renders a Man guilty of a <hi>Fault,</hi> as well as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the <hi>Penalty</hi> of that Law. But out of theſe two Caſes, I muſt conſeſs, I do not ſee, how a purely Humane Law doth Oblige the Conſcience; or how the Tranſgreſſion of it, doth make a Man guilty of Sin, before God. For it is certain if we ſecure theſe two Points; that is to ſay, the good of the Publick, and of private Perſons; and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>th all the ſacredneſs, and reſpect; which is due to Authority, (which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Order to the Publick good:) We Anſwer all the Ends, for which the Power of making Laws, or laying Commands upon Inferiours, was Committed by God to Mankind.</p>
                        <p>So that though it be true, that Humane Laws do Oblige the Conſcience, yet it is alſo true that a great many Caſes may, and do happen, in which a Man may Act contrary to a purely Humane Law, and yet not be a Sinner before God. Always ſuppoſing (as I ſaid;) there be no <hi>Contempt,</hi> or <hi>Refractoryneſs</hi> expreſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Governours: Nor, no <hi>Scandal,</hi> or ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample given to others, by <hi>the Action.</hi> For if there be either of theſe in the Caſe; I dare not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Man, from being a Tranſgreſſour of Gods Law, in the inſtance, wherein he Tranſgreſſeth the Laws of <hi>Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For this is that which we inſiſt upon; that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our Governours ought to be held, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed very ſacred, both becauſe the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and the Publick good require it ſhould be ſo. And herefore, wherever they do peremptorily lay their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:215"/> Commands upon us, we are bound in Conſcience ſo far to comply, as not to <hi>conteſt</hi> the matter with them; nor to <hi>ſeem</hi> to do it. And though their Commands, as to the <hi>matter</hi> of them, be never ſo ſlight; nay, though they ſhould prove really inconvenient, either to our ſelves, or the Publick. Yet if they <hi>ſtand</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, if they perſiſt in requiring our Obedience to them; we muſt yield, we muſt Obey; always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they be not againſt Gods Laws. For we are at no hand either to affront their Authority our ſelves; or to encourage others, by our Example, to do it. For to do either of theſe things is a greater Evil to the Publtck, than our Obedience to an inconvenient <hi>Law</hi> can eaſily be.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And now it is time for us to apply what hath been ſaid in General, concerning the <hi>Rule of Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>Obligation of Humane Laws;</hi> to the particular Matter here before us; that is, the buſineſs of <hi>Church Communion;</hi> The <hi>Obligation of Conſcience</hi> to which, in ſuch manner as the <hi>Laws</hi> have appointed, is the Fourth general Head we are to conſider.</p>
                        <p>This point of the <hi>Obligation to Communion with the Church, as by Law Eſtabliſhed,</hi> hath been largely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſeveral Learned Men of our Church, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it is the Argument of one of thoſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which have lately been writ for the ſake of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. Thither therefore I refer the Reader for full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about this Matter being only juſt to touch upon it here, as one of the Principles we take for granted, and ſhall proceed upon in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                        <p>And here the Propoſition we lay down is this, <hi>That it is every Mans Duty, and conſequently every Man is bound in Conſcience to joyn in Communion with that Church, which is Eſtabliſhed by Law in the place where he lives;</hi>
                           <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:215"/> 
                           <hi>ſo long as that Church is a true, ſound part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and there is nothing impoſed or required as a Condition of Communicating with it, that is Repugnant to the Laws of God, or the Appointments of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Propoſition is Evident, not only becauſe it Neceſſarily follows from the foregoing Principle; which was, that every Man is bound in Conſcience to Obey the Laws of Men that are not contrary to the Laws of God; and therefore conſequently a Man is bound to Obey in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> matters, as well as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> (unleſs it can be ſhew'd that Chriſt hath forbid all Humane Authority, whether <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> to make any Laws or Orders about Religion; which I believe never was or can be ſhew'd:)</p>
                        <p>But it is Evident upon another Account, which I deſire may be conſidered. We are all really bound by the Laws of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Nature of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to preſerve as much as in uslyes the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> Which <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> doth conſiſt not only in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> but joyning together with our Brethren under Common <hi>Governours</hi> in the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Communion</hi> of Worſhip, and Sacraments. And therefore whoever breaks this <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church, by withdrawing his Obedience from thoſe Church Governours, which God hath ſet over him in the place where he Lives; and Separating from the Eſtabliſhed Religious Aſſemblies of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under thoſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; doth really tranſgreſs the Laws of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and is Guilty of that Sin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is ſo very much cautioned againſt, and ſo highly Condemned in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament: Unleſs in the mean time it doth appear to the Man, who thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws, and Separates, that there is ſomething requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him in thoſe Aſſemblies, and by thoſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and that as a Term, and Condition of holding
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:216"/> Communion with them, which he cannot Submit to without Sin.</p>
                        <p>And this Point I do heartily wiſh was well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our diſſenting Brethren. They do ſeem often to look upon this buſineſs of coming to Church, and joyning with us in Prayers and Sacraments, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to bind their Conſcience than other purely Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws. They think they owe no Obedience to the Laws in theſe matters, different from that which they yield to any common Act of Parliament. And therefore no wonder they often make ſo ſlight a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them.</p>
                        <p>But this is a great miſtake, there is much more in theſe things than this comes to. The withdrawing our Communion from the Church carrys a far greater guilt in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the Violating any Law, that is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Humane. For though we do readily grant that all the Circumſtances of Publick Worſhip enjoyned in the Church, as for Inſtance, the Times, the Geſtures, the Forms of Prayer, the Methods of Reading the Scripture, and Adminiſtring the Sacraments; as alſo the Habits of the Miniſters that are to Officiate; be all of <hi>Humane</hi> Inſtitution, and may be altered, and varyed at the diſcretion of our Governours: Yet the Publick Worſhip it ſelf under Publick Lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours is of Divine Appointment, and no Man can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it without Sinning againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as well as Offending againſt the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Laws.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Humane</hi> Law grounded upon a <hi>Divine,</hi> or to ſpeak more properly, a <hi>Divine</hi> Law modify'd or Clothed with ſeveral Circumſtances of Mans Appointment, doth Create another kind of Obligation upon every Subject, than a Law that is purely <hi>Humane;</hi> that is to ſay a Law, the matter of which is neither Good nor Evil in it ſelf, but perfectly indifferent. In the former
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:216"/> Caſe, we muſt yield Obedience to the Law, as to the Law of God; however it comes Clothed with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Mans Appointment. In the other Caſe we only yield Obedience, as to the Command of Man; and for no other reaſon, than that God in general hath Obliged us to Obey our Superiors.</p>
                        <p>To make this a little plainer, let us for Inſtance take the buſineſs of Paying <hi>Tribute,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which Caſe there is a Complication of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, with a Humane, as it is in the Caſe we are now upon. That every Subject ſhould <hi>Pay Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom is due;</hi> is a Law of God; as being a branch both of Natural and Chriſtian Juſtice: But out of what goods we ſhould Pay Tribute or Cuſtom, or what Proportion of thoſe Goods ſhould be Paid, this is not defined either by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the Law of the Goſpel, but is left to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Municipal Laws of every Kingdom. But now, becauſe Humane Authority doth interpoſe in this Affair, and ſettles what every Man is to Pay to the King, and out of what Commodities; doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if a Man can by Fraud or Concealment detain the Kings Right from him, that he incurs no other guilt for this, but only the Tranſgreſſing of an Act of Parliament, and the being Obnoxious to the Penalties, in Caſe he be detected? No certainly; for all that the Cuſtoms in that manner, and form be ſettled upon the King by Humane Law only; yet the matter of that Law being a point of Natural Juſtice between Man and Man; the Man that is thus Guilty, ought to look upon himſelf as an Offender againſt the Divine Law; as an unjuſt Perſon before God. And his willingneſs to Submit to the Forfeiture of his Goods, will not render him leſs unjuſt, or more excuſeable.</p>
                        <p>The Caſe is much the ſame as to the matter we have now before us. It is not a meer Humane Law,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:217"/> or Act of Parliament that Obligeth us to keep the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church; to bring our Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ldren to be made Chriſtians by Baptiſme; to meet together at Solemn times for the Profeſſion of our Faith, for the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, for the Commemorating the Death of our Saviour in the Sacrament of his Supper. All this is tyed upon us by the Laws of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Theſe things are as much required of us by God, as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> as it is required that we ſhould Pay the King, and every Man, what is due to them, if we would not be diſhoneſt &amp; unjuſt. It is true that the particular Forms, and Modes, and Circumſtances of doing theſe things, are not Commanded, nor Preſcribed, by the Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in this Inſtance of Church Communion, no more than they are preſcribed by the Laws of God in the other Inſtance I gave: But they are left intirely to the Prudence, and Diſcretion of the Governours that God hath ſet over us in Eccleſiaſtical matters; juſt as they are in the other. But in the mean time theſe things thus Clothed by Humane Authority, as to their <hi>Circumſtances:</hi> Yet being for the <hi>Matter</hi> of them bound upon us by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, we can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our Obedience to the Publick Laws about them, than we can in the other Inſtance I have named. And that Man may as well for Inſtance, purge himſelf from the Imputation of <hi>Knavery</hi> before God, that will contrive a way of his own, for the Paying his juſt Debts contrary to what the Law of the Land hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Juſt and Honeſt: As any Man can acquit himſelf from the Sin of Schiſm before God, that will chuſe a way of his own for the Publick Worſhip, different from, and in Oppoſition to what the Laws of the Church have preſcribed; always ſuppoſing, that the Worſhip Eſtabliſhed be Commanded by juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and there be nothing required in it as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:217"/> of Communion that is againſt the Laws of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Sum of all this is, that it is every Mans Duty by the Laws of Chriſt, as well as the Laws of Man, to Worſhip God in the way of the Church; ſo long as there is nothing required in that Worſhip, that can juſtly offend the Conſcience of a Wiſe and Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And therefore there is more in departing from the Communion of the Church, when we can Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hold it, than meerly the Violation of a <hi>Statute,</hi> or a <hi>Humane Law,</hi> for we cannot do it without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law of God. Nay ſo much is it againſt the Law of God to do this, that I think no Authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth can warrant it. So that even if there was a Law made, which ſhould Ordain that wilful, cauſleſs Separation from the Eſtabliſhed Church ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and tolerated, and no Man ſhould be called to an Account for it: Yet nevertheleſs ſuch a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſtill be a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> would ſtill be a Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; for no Humane Law can make that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful which Gods Law hath forbid.</p>
                        <p>There now only remains our laſt general Head about Conſcience to be ſpoken to, and then we have done with our <hi>Preliminary</hi> Points: And that is concerning the <hi>Authority of Conſcience,</hi> or <hi>how far a Man is Obliged to follow or be guided by his Conſcience in his Actions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When we ſpeak of the Obligation of Conſcience, or of being bound in Conſcience to do or not to do an Action, it ſufficiently appears from what hath been ſaid, that we can mean no more by theſe Phraſes than this, that we are convinced in our Judgment that it is our Duty to do this or the other Action, becauſe we believe that God hath Commanded it. Or we are perſwaded in our Judgment that we ought to forbear
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:218"/> this or the other Action, becauſe we believe that God hath forbidden it.</p>
                        <p>This now being that which we mean by the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> here we come to inquire how far this Perſwaſion or Judgment of ours, concerning what is our Duty, and what is Sinful, hath Authority over us, how far it doth Oblige us to Act or not Act, according to it.</p>
                        <p>Now in Order to the reſolving of this we muſt take Notice, that our Judgment concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ng what God hath Commanded, or Forbidden, or left Indifferent, is either true or falſe. We either make a right Judgment of our Duty, or we make a wrong one. In the former Caſe we call our Judgment a <hi>Right Conſcience;</hi> in the latter we call it an <hi>Erroneous Conſcience.</hi> As for thoſe Caſes where we doubt and heſitate, and know not well how to make any Judgment at all (which is that we call a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> but indeed is properly no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, unleſs by Accident,) we have nothing here to do with them, but ſhall reſerve them to another place. Here we ſuppoſe, that we do make a Judgment of the thing; that is, we are perſwaded in our Minds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the goodneſs, or badneſs of this, or the other Action: And that which we are to inquire into, is, how far that Judgment binds us to Act according to it.</p>
                        <p>Now if our Conſcience be a <hi>Right Conſcience;</hi> that is, if we have truly informed our Judgment according to the Rule of Gods Law: It is beyond all Queſtion, and acknowledged by all the World, that we are in that Caſe perpetually bound to Act according to our Judgment. It is for ever our Duty ſo to do; and there can no blame, no guilt fall upon us, for ſo doing, let the Conſequence of our Acting, or not Acting, be what it will. So that as to a <hi>Right Conſcience,</hi> or a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:218"/> well informed Judgment, there is no diſpute among a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort of Men.</p>
                        <p>But the great thing to be inquired into, is, what Obligation a Man is under to Act according to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuppoſing it be falſe, ſuppoſing he hath not rightly informed his Conſcience, but hath taken up falſe meaſures of what God hath Commanded, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Reſolution of this, I lay down theſe Three Propoſitions, which I think will take in all that is needful, for the giving Satisfaction to every one, concerning this point.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Where a Man is miſtaken in his Judgment, even in that Caſe it is always a Sin to Act againſt it.</hi> Be our Conſcience never ſo ill inſtructed, as to what is <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Evil,</hi> though we ſhould take that for a <hi>Duty,</hi> which is really a <hi>Sin;</hi> and on the contrary, that for a <hi>Sin</hi> which is really a <hi>Duty:</hi> Yet ſo long as we are thus perſuaded, it will be highly Criminal in us, to Act in contradiction to this perſuaſion; and the reaſon of this is evident, becauſe, by ſo doing, we wilfully Act againſt the beſt light, which at preſent we have, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Actions; and conſequently our <hi>Will</hi> is as faulty, and as wicked, in conſenting to ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if we had had truer Notions of things.</p>
                        <p>We are to remember, that the <hi>Rule</hi> of our Duty, whatever it be in it ſelf, cannot touch or affect our Actions, but by the Mediation of our <hi>Conſcience;</hi> that is, no farther than as it is apprehended by us, or as we do underſtand and remember it. So that when all is done, the <hi>immediate Guide</hi> of our Actions, can be nothing but our <hi>Conſcience;</hi> our Judgment and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, concerning the Goodneſs, or Badneſs, or Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, of things.</p>
                        <p>It is true in all thoſe Inſtances where we are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:219"/> our Conſcience proves but a very bad and unſafe <hi>Guide;</hi> becauſe it hath it ſelf loſt its way, in not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing its <hi>Rule</hi> as it ſhould have done: But however our <hi>Guide</hi> ſtill it is, and we have no other guide of our Actions but that. And if we may lawfully refuſe to be guided by it in one Inſtance, we may with as much reaſon reject its Guidance in all.</p>
                        <p>What is the Notion that any of us hath of a Wilful Sin, or a Sin againſt Knowledg, but this? That we have done otherwiſe than we were convinced to be our Duty, at the ſame time that we did ſo. And what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaſures have we of any Mans <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie?</hi> But only this; that he Acts according to the beſt of his Judgment, or that he doth not Act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he pretends to Believe.</p>
                        <p>We do not indeed ſay, that every one is a <hi>good</hi> Man, that Acts according to his Judgment; or that he is to be commended for all Actions that are done in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Perſwaſion: No, we meaſure <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> by the <hi>Rule,</hi> according to which, a Man ought to Act; as <hi>well</hi> as by the Mans <hi>intention</hi> in Acting. But however we all agree that that Man is a <hi>Knave,</hi> that in any inſtance Acts contrary to that which he took to be his <hi>duty.</hi> And in paſſing this Sentence we have no regard to this; whether the Man was Right or miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Judgment, for be his Judgment Right or Wrong, True or Falſe; it is all one as to his Honeſty, in Acting or not Acting according to it.</p>
                        <p>He that hath a falſe perſwaſion of things; ſo long as that perſwaſion continues, is often as well ſatisfied that he is in the Right, as if his Perſwaſion was true. That is, he is oftentimes as Confident when he is in an Error, as when he is in the Right. And therefore we cannot but conclude, that he, who being under a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, will be tempted to Act contrary to his Judgment;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:219"/> would certainly upon the ſame Temptation Act con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to it, was his Judgment never ſo well informed And therefore his <hi>Will</hi> being as bad in the one Caſe, as in the other, he is equally a Sinner as to the <hi>Wilfulneſs</hi> of the Crime, tho indeed in other reſpects there will be a great difference in the Caſes.</p>
                        <p>This I believe is the Senſe of all Men in this matter. If a Man for inſtance, ſhould of a <hi>Jew</hi> become a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> while yet in his Heart he believeth that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is not yet come, and that our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was an Impoſtor. Or if a <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſhould to ſerve ſome private ends, Renounce the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and joyn with ours; while yet he is perſwaded that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the <hi>only Catholick</hi> Church; and that our Reformed Churches are <hi>Heretical</hi> or <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> Though now there is none of us will deny that the Men in both theſe Caſes have made a good change; as having changed a <hi>falſe</hi> Religion for a <hi>true</hi> one: yet for all that, I dare ſay, we ſhould all agree, they were both of them great <hi>Villains</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> for making that change; becauſe they made it not upon Honeſt Principles, and in purſuance of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in direct Contradiction to both. Nay I dare ſay we ſhould all of us think better of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant well meaning <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> that being ſeduced by the perſwaſions and Artifices of a cunning <hi>Popiſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> did really out of Conſcience, abandon our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and go over to the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> as thinking theirs to be the ſafeſt: I ſay we ſhould all of us enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more favourable Opinion of ſuch a Man in ſuch a Caſe; Though really here the change is made from a true Keligion to a falſe one; than we ſhould of either of the other Men I have before named. All this put together is abundantly ſufficient to ſhew that no Man
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:220"/> can in any Caſe Act againſt his Judgment or Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but he is Guilty of Sin in ſo doing,</p>
                        <p>But then, our Second Propoſition is this, <hi>The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of a Mans Judgment may be of ſuch a Nature, that as it will be a Sin to Act againſt his Judgment, ſo it will likewiſe be a Sin to Act according to it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For what Authority ſoever a Mans Conſcience has over him, it can never bear him out, if he do an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thing in compliance with it. My Judgment is (as we have ſaid) the guide of my Actions; but it may through my negligence be ſo far miſguided it ſelf; as that if I follow it, it will lead me into the moſt horrid Crimes in the World. And will it be a ſufficient Excuſe or Juſtification of my Action in ſuch a Caſe to ſay; that indeed herein I did but Act according to my Perſwaſion? No verily; I may as certainly be damn'd without Repentance, for Acting according to my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſome Caſes, where it is miſtaken, as I ſhall be, for Acting contrary to it in other Caſes where it is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed.</p>
                        <p>And the Reaſon of this is very plain. It is not my Judgment or Perſwaſion that makes <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil, Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong, Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Injuſtice, Vertue</hi> or <hi>Vice.</hi> But it is the Nature of things themſelves; and the Law of God, (and of Men under that) Commanding or Forbidding things, that makes them ſo. If the <hi>Moral</hi> Goodneſs, or badneſs of Actions was to be meaſured by Mens Opinions, and Perſwaſions; then Good and Evil, Duty and Sin, would be the moſt various, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things in the World. They would change their Natures as often as Men change their Opinions; and that which to Day is a Vertue, to Morrow would be a Crime; and that which in one Man, would be a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roically good Action, would in another Man be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Piece of Villany; though yet there was no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:220"/> difference in the Action it ſelf, or in the Circumſtances of the Man that did it, ſave only the difference of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
                        <p>But ſuch conſequences as theſe are intolerable, nor indeed do Men either talk or think after this manner. Every Man when he ſpeaks of Good or Evil, Lawful or Unlawful, means ſome certain fixed thing which it is not in his Power to alter the Nature and Property of. That Action is good, and a Duty, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo in it ſelf, or made ſo by ſome poſitive Law of God. And that Action is Evil, and a Sin, that is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by God in either of theſe Ways. So that unleſs it was in our Power to change the Nature of things; or to alter the Laws of God: It will unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; that we ſhall be for ever Obliged to do ſome Actions, and to forbear others, whatever our Judgment concerning them, is: And conſequently we may be Guilty of Sin, if in theſe inſtances we Act contrary to this Obligation; though at the ſame time it ſhould happen that we are firmly perſwaded that we ought ſo to do.</p>
                        <p>And thus is our Propoſition fully proved; but then for the further clearing of it, I deſire it may be taken notice of: that we do not thus lay it down, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry miſtake of Judgment about Good or Evil, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve a Man in Sin, if he Act according to that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: But only thus, the miſtake of a Mans Judgment <hi>may be</hi> of ſuch a Nature, that as it will be a a Sin in him to Act againſt it, ſo it will likewiſe be Sin to Act according to it. It is not every Error in Morals that brings a Man under the neceſſity of Sinning, if he purſues it in his Actions. A Mans Conſcience may miſtake its Rule in a Hundred inſtances, and yet he may ſafely enough Act according to it. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe a Man may entertain a great many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:221"/> and falſe Notions of his Duty, and Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them too; and yet in ſuch Actions he ſhall not Tranſgreſs any Law of God.</p>
                        <p>Now this that I ſay, holds chiefly in theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlances. For example in the firſt place, if a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a thing to be Commanded by God which yet indeed is not; but neither is it Forbidden: As if a Man ſhould think himſelf Obliged to retire himſelf from his buſineſs, <hi>Seven</hi> times or <hi>Three</hi> times a Day, for the purpoſe of Devotion; or to give half of his Yearly Income to Pious, and Charitable uſes, if he can do it without Prejudice to his family. Now in this Caſe he is certainly miſtaken in his Duty; for the Law of God hath not bound him up to ſuch meaſures in either of theſe inſtances: But yet becauſe God hath not on the other hand laid any Commands upon him to the contrary; it is certain he may in both theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Act according to this miſtake, without any Guilt in the World; Nay, ſo long as that miſtake conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, he is bound to Act accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Again in the ſecond place, if a Man believe a thing to be Forbidden by Gods Law, which yet is not; but neither is it Commanded: As for inſtance, if a Man think that he ought by Vertue of a Divine Command to abſtain from all Meats that are ſtrangled or have Bloud in them; or if he believe it unlawful to Play at Cards or Dice; or that it is Forbidden by Gods word to let out Money at Intereſt: Why in all theſe Caſes he may follow his Opinion, though it be a falſe one, without Sin; Nay, he is bound to follow it, becauſe it is the dictate of his Conſcience, however his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be miſtaken. And the reaſon is plain, becauſe though he be miſtaken in his Judgment about theſe matters, yet ſince God hath not by any Law, Forbid
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:221"/> theſe things; there is no Tranſgreſſion follows upon Acting according to ſuch a miſtake.</p>
                        <p>But then in other Caſes where a Mans miſtake hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be of ſuch a Nature, as that he cannot Act according to his Conſcience, but he Tranſgreſſeth ſome Law of God; by which Conſcience ought to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned: As for inſtance, when a Man looks upon that as a Lawful Action, or as a Duty, which God hath Forbidden; or looks upon that as a Sin, or at leaſt an indifferent Action, which God hath Commanded; here it is that the miſtake becomes dangerous. And in ſuch Caſes the Man is brought into that ſad <hi>Dilemma</hi> we have been repreſenting, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he Act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his perſwaſion he Tranſgreſſeth Gods Law, and ſo is a Sinner upon that Account: If he Acts againſt his perſwaſion, then he is ſelf condemned, and very guilty before God upon that Account.</p>
                        <p>Well, but is there no avoiding of this? Muſt it be laid down as a conſtant Univerſal Truth; that in all Caſes where a Mans Judgment happens to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Rule of his Duty, Commanding, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding an Action; he muſt of neceſſity Sin; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he Act, or not Act, according to that Judgment? If indeed he Act againſt his Conſcience, it is readily granted he Sins; But it ſeems very hard, that he ſhould be under a neceſſity of Sinning when he Acts according to it; eſpecially when he is perfectly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, or miſtaken in the Law againſt which he Offends.</p>
                        <p>This is indeed the great difficulty that occurs in this matter; and for the untying it, I lay down this third general Propoſition, <hi>viz. That the great thing to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in this Caſe of a Mans following a miſtaken Judgment, is the Culpableneſs or Inculpableneſs;</hi> the <hi>Faultineſs or Innocence of the miſtake, upon which he Acts;</hi>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:222"/> 
                           <hi>for according as this is; ſo will his Guilt in Acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it be either greater, or leſs, or none at all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We do not ſay that a Man is always Guilty of a Sin before God, when upon a miſinformation of Judgment he Omits that which Gods Law hath Commanded; or doth that which Gods Law hath Forbidden. No though theſe Omiſſions or Actions may be ſaid to be Sins in themſelves; that is, as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of them; as being Tranſgreſſions of Gods Law: Yet before we affirm that they will be imputed to a Man as ſuch; that is prove <hi>formally</hi> Sins to him; we firſt conſider the Nature of the Action, and the Circumſtances of the Man. If we find upon Examination that the inſtance wherein Gods Law is Tranſgreſſed, is ſuch an inſtance as even an Honeſt minded Man may well be ſuppoſed to miſtake in: And if we find likewiſe that the Man had not ſufficient means for the informing himſelf aright as to this matter; and that he hath done all that he could do in his Circumſtances to underſtand his Duty: If in ſuch a Caſe as this he be miſtaken in his Duty; and Act upon that miſtake; yet we do not ſay that the Man is properly Guilty of any Sin in that Action, however that Action is indeed contrary to the Law of God. On the contrary we believe him to be Innocent as to this matter; nor will God ever call him to an Account for what he hath done or omitted in theſe Circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>And the Reaſons and Grounds upon which we affirm this are plain, and Evident at the firſt hearing. No Man can be Obliged to do more then what is in his Power to do. And what ever a Man is not Obliged to do, it is no Sin in him if he do it not. So that if a Man do all that one in his Circumſtances can, or ſhould do; for the right underſtanding of his Duty: If he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be miſtaken, that miſtake cannot be imputed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:222"/> to him as a Sin; becauſe he was not Obliged to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand better. And if his miſtake be no Sin, it is certain to Act according to that miſtake can be no Sin neither.</p>
                        <p>So that the whole point of Sinning, or not Sinning, in following an <hi>Erroneous Conſcience,</hi> lies here. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Man that is thus miſperſuaded, is to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or not blamed, for his Miſperſuaſion. If the Error he hath taken up do not proceed from his own Fault and Negligence; but was the pure unavoidable Effects of the Circumſtances, in which he is placed; (which Circumſtances we ſuppoſe he contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to, but he was put into them by the diſpoſition of Divine Providence:) Then of what Nature ſoever the Error be; he doth not contract any guilt by any Action which he doth in purſuance of that Error. But if it was in his power to Rectifie that Error; if he had Means and Opportunities to inform his Conſcience bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the nature of the Action was ſuch, that it was his Duty ſo to do: So that he muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilty of a Groſs and Criminal Neglect in not doing it: In this Caſe the Man is a Tranſgreſſor, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable unto God, as ſuch, for all the Actions that he doth, or omits, contrary to Gods Law; while he Acts under that miſtake, or in purſuance of it. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as this Neglect or Careleſneſs is greater or leſs; ſo is the Sinfulneſs of the Action which he doth in purſuance of it, greater or leſs likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>And this is a plain account of this matter. So that we ſee there is no Fatal unavoidable neceſſity laid upon any Man to commit a Sin by Acting according to his Conſcience. But if at any time he be brought under thoſe ſad Circumſtances, he brings that neceſſity upon himſelf. God never put any Man into ſuch a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that he might do that Duty which was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:223"/> of him; and be able to give a good account of his Actions. But here is the thing; Men by their Vice and Wickedneſs; by neglecting the Means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that are afforded them; and not uſing their Reaſon and Underſtanding as they ſhould do; may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be brought under the Bondage of ſuch Falſe and Evil Principles; that they ſhall ſo long as they hold thoſe Principles, fall into Sin, whether they Act according to their Conſcience, or Act againſt it.</p>
                        <p>I have done with the general Points concerning <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> which I thought needful to be premiſed, as the Grounds and Principles of our following Diſcourſe. I now come to that which I at firſt propoſed; and for the ſake of which all this is intended; that is, to ſpeak to the Caſe of thoſe that <hi>Separate from the Communion of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>upon this pretence; That it is againſt their Conſcience to join with us in it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now all that I conceive needful to be done, in order to a full diſcuſſion of this Caſe, and giving ſatisfaction about it, are theſe Two things,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, To <hi>Separate the pretences of Conſcience that are truly and juſtly made, in this matter, from the falſe ones:</hi> Or to ſhew who thoſe are that can rightly plead Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for their Nonconformity; and who thoſe are that cannot.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, To inquire how far this <hi>Plea of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> when it is <hi>truly made, will Juſtifie any Diſſenter that continnes in Separation from the Church, as Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed among us;</hi> and what is to be done by ſuch a Perſon, in order to his Acting with a ſafe and good Conſcience in this affair.</p>
                        <p>Our firſt inquiry is what is required in order to any Mans truly pleading Conſcience for his refuſing to joyn in Communion with the Eſtabliſhed Church. Or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:223"/> who thoſe Perſons are that can with juſtice make that Plea for themſelves.</p>
                        <p>I think it very convenient to begin my Diſquiſition here, becauſe by removing all the falſe Pretences to Conſcience; the Controverſy will be brought into a much leſs compaſs; and the difficulties that ariſe will be more eaſily untyed. The truth is, if the thing be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, I believe it will be found, that the pretence to Conſcience in the matter we are talking of, is, as in many other Caſes, extended much farther than it ought to be. My meaning is, that of all thoſe who think fit to withdraw from our Communion, and to live in Diſobedience to the known Laws of the Church, and pretend Conſcience for ſo doing; in a great many of them it is not Conſcience, but ſome other thing miſtaken for Conſcience, which is the Principle they Act upon. So that if the true Plea of Conſcience be ſeparated from thoſe counterfeit ones, which uſually uſurp that Name; we ſhall not find either the Perſons to be ſo many that refuſe Communion with us, upon the Account of Conſcience truly ſo called; nor the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be ſo many in which they do refuſe it upon that Account.</p>
                        <p>Now in Order to the making ſuch a Separation or Diſtinction between Conſcience <hi>truly</hi> ſo called, and the ſeveral <hi>Pretences</hi> to it, in this buſineſs of not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eſtabliſhed Worſhip, I lay down this general Propoſition; That, if the Principles I have laid down about Conſcience be admitted; then it is certainly true, that no Man among us can juſtly plead Conſcience for his Separation from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or can ſay that it is againſt his Conſcience to joyn in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it; but only ſuch a one, as is perſwaded in his own mind, that he cannot Communicate with us without Sinning againſt God in ſo doing.</p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:224"/>
                        <p>For ſince, as we have ſaid, Conſcience is nothing elſe but a Mans Judgment concerning Actions, whether they be Duties, or Sins, or Indifferent: And ſince the Law of God Commanding or Forbidding Actions; or neither Commanding them, nor Forbidding them; is the only Rule by which a Man can Judg what Actions are Duties, and what are Sins, and what are Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: It plainly follows; that as a Man cannot be <hi>bound in Conſcience</hi> to do any Action which it doth not appear to him that Gods Law hath ſome way or other Commanded, and made a Duty: So neither can it <hi>go againſt a Mans Conſcience,</hi> to do any Action which he is not convinced that Gods Law hath ſome way or other Forbidden, and ſo made a Sin. And therefore in our preſent Caſe. That Man only can juſtly plead Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his Nonconformity that can truly ſay he is perſwaded in his Judgment that Conformity is Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by ſome Law of God: Or which is the ſame thing; No Man can ſay, it is againſt his Conſcience to joyn in our Communion, but only ſuch a one as really believes he ſhall Sin againſt ſome Law of God, if he do joyn with us,</p>
                        <p>If againſt this it be excepted; that it is very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Man to be well ſatisfied that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing directly Sinful in our Worſhip; but yet for all that it may be againſt his Conſcience to joyn with us in it: As for inſtance, in the Caſe where a Man takes it really to be his Duty to hold conſtant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſome other Congregation, where he believes he can be more Edified, or to which he is related by ſome Church Covenant: To this I anſwer, that in this Caſe, I grant, Conſcience is rightly pleaded for Separation (though how juſtifiably I do not now Examine:) But then I ſay this Plea proceeds upon the ſame grounds I juſt now laid down. For if the Man (as is ſuppoſed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:224"/> in the Caſe) be convinced that it is his Duty by Gods Law, (as there is no other meaſure of Duty) to hold Communion with others, and not with us; then he muſt at the ſame time be convinced that he cannot without Tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, (that is, without Sin,) joyn with us; And that is the ſame Account which we give, of its being againſt any Mans Conſcience to hold Communion with us.</p>
                        <p>Further, If it be urged againſt our Propoſition, that not only in the Caſe where a Man is perſwaded of the Unlawfulneſs of our Communion, but alſo in the Caſe where he only doubts of the Lawfulneſs of it, a Man may juſtly plead Conſcience for his Nonconformity, ſo long as thoſe doubts remain: And therefore it is not truly ſaid of us, that in Order to the Pleading Conſcience for Nonconformity, one muſt be perſwaded in his own mind, that Conformity is Forbidden by ſome Law of God. I Anſwer, that if the Man who thus doubts of the Lawfulneſs of Conformity, hath really entertain'd this Principle, that it is a Sin to do any thing with a doubting Conſcience; I grant that it muſt go againſt his Conſcience to conform ſo long as he doubts. But then, this is but the ſame thing we are contending for; for therefore it goes againſt his Conſcience to Communicate with us, doubting as he doth; becauſe he believes he ſhall Sin againſt God if he ſhould. But if the Man we are ſpeaking of, do not think it a breach of Gods Law, to Act with a doubting Conſcience; then I do not ſee how it can in the leaſt go againſt his Conſcience to Communicate with us upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. So that notwithſtanding theſe two Exceptions; which are all I can think of; it will ſtill remain true, that no Man can juſtly Plead Conſcience for his Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church, but he that is perſwaded that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:225"/> he cannot joyn with it without Sinning againſt God.</p>
                        <p>Now if this Propoſition be true, as certainly it is; then how many Mens pretences to Conſcience for their Separating from us, are hereby cut off: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how few (in Compariſon of the multitude of Diſſenters among us) will be left, that can be able with Truth to ſay that it is againſt their Conſcience to Communicate with us in our Prayers, and in our Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Place, it is Evident that all thoſe who Separate from us upon Account of any <hi>private grudge</hi> or <hi>pique;</hi> becauſe they have been diſobliged, or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome diſappointment in the way of our Church, or by the Men that are favourers of it; and therefore out of a Pet will joyn themſelves to another Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. All thoſe that think they can ſerve their own turns more effectually, by being of another way; as for inſtance, they can thereby better <hi>pleaſe a Relation</hi> from whom they have expectances; they can better advance their Trade, or increaſe their Fortunes; they can better <hi>procure a Reputation,</hi> or <hi>regain</hi> one that is <hi>Sunk.</hi> In a word, all thoſe that to ſerve any ends of <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> or <hi>Paſſion,</hi> or out of any other worldly Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, do refuſe us their Company in the Worſhip of God. I ſay, all ſuch are certainly excluded from Pleading Conſcience for their Separation.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Place, all thoſe Lay People who refuſe our Communion upon Account that the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> whom they moſt Love, and Reverence, are not permitted to Exerciſe their Function among us; whoſe Pretence it is, that if theſe good Men were allowed to Teach in our Churches, they would come to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; but ſo long as that is refuſed, they will hear them where they can: I ſay, all theſe are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe excluded from Pleading Conſcience for their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:225"/> For, however it may really and truly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Conſcience of their <hi>Miniſters</hi> to conform, (there being other things required of them, than of ordinary People,) yet it is not againſt <hi>their</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo to do; for they know no ill in Conformity, but only that ſo many good Men are ſilenced.</p>
                        <p>In the third Place, all thoſe that refuſe our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon a <hi>meer diſlike</hi> of ſeveral things in our Church Offices: They do not for inſtance, like a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> in general, and they have ſeveral things to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt our <hi>Form</hi> in particular; they do not like our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> they do not like the <hi>Surplice,</hi> or the <hi>Croſs in</hi> Baptiſm; and ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things they find fault with: Not that they have any thing to ſay againſt the Lawfulneſs of theſe things; but only they have an Averſion to them: All theſe Men likewiſe are cut off from. Pleading Conſcience for their Separation. For they do not pretend that it is unlawful, or a Sin againſt God to joyn with us in our Service (which is the only thing wherein their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can be concerned;) but only they are not <hi>pleaſed</hi> with many things in our Service; as fancying them not to be ſo decent, or convenient, or not to be ſo prudently Order'd as they would have them. But what of all this? Admit the things to be ſo as they fancy them; yet ſtill ſo long as they do not think there is any Sin in them, it cannot go againſt their Conſcience to joyn with any Aſſembly in which they are Practiſed. Becauſe Conſcience as we have often ſaid is not touched, is not affected where no Law of God is Tranſgreſſed.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth Place, all thoſe that are kept from our Communion, purely upon the Account of <hi>Education,</hi> or acquaintance with Perſons that are of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. Thoſe that have nothing to ſay againſt our Worſhip; but only that they were bred in another way;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:226"/> or thoſe that would joyn with us in it, but that they know a great many Religious Godly Perſons that do Condemn it, and therefore they dare not come at us. Theſe now may be very well meaning Men, but yet they cannot reaſonably Plead Conſcience upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their Separation. For it is not a Mans Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or the Example, or Opinion of other Men, that makes any Action to be a Duty, or a Sin, but the Law of God Commanding or Forbidding that Action. And therefore before I can ſay that this, or the other Action, is againſt my Conſcience, I muſt believe that Gods Law hath either in general, or in particular; either directly, or by Conſequence, made that Action unlawful. I grant the Opinions of other Men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that are Learned, and Pious are always to be liſtned to in doubtful Caſes. But then, no Mans Opinion can be the Rule of my Conſcience; nor am I at all concerned in Conſcience to follow it, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I am convinced that it declares Gods Law to me. And therefore ſure in this Caſe of Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, I can be but very little concerned to follow any Mans Opinion; when, both there are ſo many Perſons, and thoſe as Learned and as Pious as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are of another Opinion; and when alſo the Publick Law, which has much more Authority than any private Opinion; hath determined what I am to do in the Caſe. So that it is great weakneſs, &amp; ſillyneſs; &amp; not Conſcience, that prevails with theſe Men I am ſpeaking of, to live in diſobedience to the Laws. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they be really perſwaded in their own Minds, that our way of Worſhipping God, is in any part or inſtance of it Unlawful or Forbidden, (let that Perſwaſion be upon what grounds it will,) then they may truly ſay it is againſt their Conſcience to joyn with us. But if they be not convinced of this; I do not ſee how
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:226"/> the Example, or the advice of their Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, can in the leaſt give them a Title to Plead Conſcience for their refuſing our Communion.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, thoſe that withdraw from the Church upon this Account, that our Governours in their Laws and Preſcriptions about Gods Worſhip, have not rightly uſed the Power which they are intruſted with, but have exceeded their bounds; have made perhaps too great Encroachments upon <hi>Chriſtian Liberty;</hi> or laid more ſtreſs than was meet upon <hi>Indifferent things:</hi> Theſe likewiſe are excluded by the former Rule from Pleading Conſcience for their Separation. For admit the Law-givers have been to blame in the Exerciſe of their Power in theſe matters, (which yet is ſooner ſaid then proved,) and have really done more then they can anſwer to God for; yet what is this to them? The Conſcience of the Governours is indeed deeply concerned about theſe things; and they muſt give an Account to God for the abuſe of their Authority if there be any, But how this doth concern the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Subject, is not eaſily underſtood: So long as what is Commanded or Enjoyned, doth not appear to interfere with any Law of God. But having ſaid this; I fear there is too much reaſon to add; that thoſe who ſo much ſtand up for <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and would be thought the great Patrons of it; do by their endleſs ſcruples about Indifferent things, and refuſing to Obey Authority in ſuch matters, in all appearance, take the moſt Effectuall Courſe to deſtroy all <hi>Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> in the true Notion of it; and to bring in a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that ſhall conſiſt of <hi>Touch not, Taſt not, Handle not;</hi> and ſuch other Uncommanded things.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, (to name no more inſtances) All thoſe that can Communicate <hi>Occaſionally</hi> with us, in our Prayers and Sacraments: As for inſtance, thoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:227"/> that when they have a turn to be ſerved, when there is an Office or ſome ſuch thing in the Caſe; can come to Church, and receive the Communion, but at other times they do not afford us their Preſence: Theſe are alſo excluded from pretending to Conſcience, for their not <hi>conſtantly</hi> joyning in Communion with us. For if indeed they did believe, it was a Sin in them to joyn with us in our Prayers and Sacraments; with what Conſcience dare they do it at all? They ought not for any worldly good, to venture upon ſuch an Action as they do believe to be forbidden by Gods Laws; But if they do not believe that to joyn in our Communion is a Sinful thing, (as I dare ſay none of theſe Perſons do) then I will be bold to make the Inference; that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more againſt their Conſcience to do it <hi>Thrice,</hi> than to do it <hi>Once;</hi> and do it <hi>conſtantly</hi> than to do it <hi>Thrice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But let us leave the falſe Pretenders to Conſcience, and come to the Caſe of thoſe who can juſtly Plead Conſcience for their Separation; or that can truly ſay it is againſt their Conſcience to joyn in our Communion.</p>
                        <p>Of this ſort are all ſuch, and none but ſuch, as do teally believe that our Communion is unlawful, or that they cannot Communicate with us without Sin, as I have before proved.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe that only doubt of the Lawfulneſs of our Communion, but are not perſwaded that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; I do not here conſider them; becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that it is <hi>againſt their Conſcience</hi> to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with us; any more than they can ſay, that they are <hi>bound in Conſcience</hi> to Communicate with us: For they are uncertain as to both theſe things, and are not determined either way. But however be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe men may juſtly Plead Conſcience upon this Account; that they think it is a Sin to joyn with us
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:227"/> ſo long as they doubt of the Lawfulneſs of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: I ſhall conſider their Caſe afterwards in a particular Diſcourſe upon that Argument.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that I am now concerned with, are ſuch, as do believe, or are perſwaded, that there is ſome thing in our Worſhip which they cannot comply with without Sinning againſt God.</p>
                        <p>And my buſineſs is to Examine <hi>whether ſuch a Belief or Perſwaſion of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs of our Communion will juſtifie any Mans Separation from us? Or how far it will do it? And what is to be done by ſuch Perſons, in order, either to their Communicating, or not Communicating with us, with a ſafe Conſcience?</hi> This is our ſecond Point, and I apply my ſelf to it.</p>
                        <p>There are a great many among us, that would with all their Hearts (as they ſay) Obey the Laws of the Church, and joyn in our Worſhip and Sacraments; but they are really perſwaded that they cannot do it without Sin: For there are ſome things required of them as Conditions of Communicating with us, which are Forbidden by the Laws of God.</p>
                        <p>As for Inſtance, it is againſt the Commands of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to appoint, or to uſe any thing in the Worſhip of God, which God himſelf hath not appointed. For this is to add to the word of God, and to <hi>Teach for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> the <hi>Commandments</hi> and Traditions of Men.</p>
                        <p>It is againſt the Commands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Stint the Spirit</hi> in Prayer; which all thoſe that uſe a Form of Prayer, muſt neceſſarily do.</p>
                        <p>It is againſt the Commands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Significant Ceremony</hi> in Religion: As for Inſtance, the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm, for that is to make new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>It is againſt the Commands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to <hi>kneel at the Lords Supper,</hi> for that is directly to contradict
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:228"/> our Saviours Example in his Inſtitution of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Savours beſides of <hi>Popiſh Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since therefore there are theſe Sinful things in our Worſhip; and thoſe too impoſed as Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; how can we blame them, if they withdraw themſelves from us? Would we have them joyn with us in theſe Practices which they verily believe to be Sins? Where then was their Conſcience? They might perhaps by this means ſhew how much they were <hi>the Servants of Men:</hi> But what would become of their Fidelity to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What now ſhall we ſay to this? They themſelves are ſo well ſatisfi'd with their own doings in theſe matters, that they do not think they are in the leaſt to be blamed for refuſing us their Communion, ſo long as things ſtand thus with them. They are ſure they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in follow their own Conſcience; and therefore they cannot doubt but they are in a ſafe Condition; and may juſtifie their Proceedings to God, and to all the World; let us ſay what we pleaſe.</p>
                        <p>This is the Caſe. Now in Anſwer to it, we muſt grant them theſe two things.</p>
                        <p>Firſt of all, that if indeed they be right in their Judgment; and thoſe things which they except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in our Communion be really Unlawful, and Forbidden by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> then they are not at all to be blamed for their not Communicating with us. For in that Caſe, Separation is not a <hi>Sin</hi> but a <hi>Duty:</hi> We being for ever bound to <hi>Obey God rather than Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Secondly, ſuppoſing they be miſtaken in their Judgment, and think that to be unlawful, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God which is not really ſo: Yet ſo long as this perſwaſion continues (though it be a falſe one) we think they cannot without Sin joyn in our Communion.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:228"/> For even an Erroneous Conſcience (as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) binds thus far, that a Man cannot without Sin Act in Contradiction to it. Theſe two things I ſay we grant them, and let them make the beſt advantage of them.</p>
                        <p>But then this is the point we ſtand upon, and which if it be true, will render this whole Plea for Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity upon account of Conſcience, as I have now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it, wholly inſufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> If it ſhould prove that our Diſſenters are miſtaken in their Judgment; and that our Governours do indeed require nothing of them in the matter of Church Communion, but what they may comply with, without breach of Gods Law: Then I ſay it will not acquit them from being Guilty of Sin before God in withdrawing from our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to ſay, that they really believed our Communion to be unlawful; and upon that Account they durſt not joyn with us.</p>
                        <p>It is not my Province here to Anſwer all their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt our Forms of Prayer, our Ceremonies, our Orders and Rules, in Adminiſtring Sacraments, and other things that concern our Communion: This hath been done ſeveral times; and of late by ſeveral Perſons which have treated of all theſe particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and who have ſhewed with great clearneſs and ſtrength, that there is nothing required in our Church Appointments, which is in the leaſt inconſiſtent with, or Forbidden by any Law of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> But on the contrary, the Eſtabliſhments of our Church, are for Gravity, Decency, Purity, and agreeableneſs with the Primitive Chriſtianity; the moſt approvable, and the leaſt Exceptionable of any Church Conſtitutions at this day in the World.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things therefore I meddle not with, but this is the point I am concerned in: Whether, ſuppoſing it be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:229"/> every Mans Duty to joyn in Communion with the Eſtabliſhed Church; and there be nothing required in that Communion, but what may be Lawfully Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? I ſay, ſuppoſing theſe two things; whether it will be ſufficient to acquit any Man from Sin, that withdraws from that Communion, upon this Account, that through his miſtake, he believes he cannot joyn with us without Sin? Or thus, whether will any mans perſwaſion that there are Sinful Terms required in our Communion (when yet there are not any) juſtifie his Separation from us.</p>
                        <p>This is the general Queſtion truly put; And this I give as the Anſwer to it: That in general ſpeaking a Mans Erroneous Perſwaſion doth not diſſolve the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Gods Law, or juſtifie any Mans Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Duty. So that if Gods Law doth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to hold Communion with the Church where I have no juſt cauſe to break it: And I have no juſt cauſe to break it in this particular Caſe, but only I think I have: My miſperſwaſion in this matter doth not diſcharge me from my Obligation to keep the Communion of the Church; or acquit me from Sin before God if I break it.</p>
                        <p>The Truth and Reaſon of this I have fully ſhewed before, in what I have ſaid about the Authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. I ſhall now only by way of further Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ask this Queſtion: Was St. <hi>Paul</hi> guilty of Sin or no, when he Perſecuted the Chriſtians; being verily perſwaded in his own mind that he ought ſo to do, and that he Sinned if he did not? If any will ſay that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not Sin in this, becauſe he did but Act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Conſcience; they contradict his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words. For he acknowledgeth himſelf to be <hi>the greateſt of Sinners,</hi> and that for this very reaſon <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he perſecuted the Church of Chriſt.</hi> If they ſay
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:229"/> that he did Sin in doing this: Then they muſt at the ſame time acknowledg, that a Mans perſwaſion that a thing is a Duty, will not excuſe him from guilt in practiſing it; if really and indeed it be againſt Gods Law: And on the other ſide, by the ſame reaſon, that a Mans perſwaſion that a thing is unlawful, will not excuſe him from guilt in not Practiſing it; if indeed Gods Law hath made it a Duty.</p>
                        <p>So that it infinitely concerns all our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to conſider very well what they do, when they withdraw from our Communion. <hi>Schiſm</hi> undoubtedly is a great and crying Sin. A Sin, againſt which, there are as many hard things ſaid in the Diſcourſes of our Lord and his Apoſtles; and in the Writings of the Ancient Chriſtians; as againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Sin whatſoever. And therefore let thoſe that forſake our Communion; and ſet up, or joyn with other Aſſemblies in Oppoſition to ours: I ſay, let them look to it that they be not involved in the Guilt of this dreadful Sin. They muſt be ſure that their Separation proceeds upon good grounds, if they would free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the imputation of it. It is not always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to excuſe them; that they do believe there are Sinful Conditions impoſed in our Communion, and conſequently it is their Duty to withdraw. For unleſs the thing be ſo indeed; their believing ſo will not cancel their Obligation to our Church Communion; or make it ceaſe to be <hi>Schiſm</hi> to withdraw themſelves from it.</p>
                        <p>This may perhaps at the firſt hearing ſeem very ſtrange Doctrine to many, but yet it is true for all that; and will appear a little more Evident, if we put the Caſe in another inſtance, wherein we are not ſo nearly concerned.</p>
                        <p>Here is one of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> perſwaſion,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:230"/> (as they call it,) that hath been trained up in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and heartily believes it to be true Religion, and the Only one, wherein Salvation is to be had; and therefore in Obedience to the Laws and Cuſtoms of that Church, doth pay Religious Worſhip to Images; doth pray to Saints and Angels; doth give Divine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration to the Conſecrated Bread in the Sacrament; as really believing it to be turned into the Body of Chriſt, to which his Soul, and Deity is perſonally U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited.</p>
                        <p>Is now ſuch a Perſon as this Guilty of Idolatry in theſe Practices or is he not? He doth verily believe that he is not. He would abhor theſe Practices, if he did in the leaſt believe, that God had Forbid them as Idolatrous. Nay he is ſo far from believing that they are Forbid, that on the contrary he hath been taught to believe that they are neceſſary Duties; and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a good Catholick, unleſs he thus Worſhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Saints, and the Bread of the Hoſt. Well, now the point is, Whether ſuch a Man, believing as he doth, be upon that Account acquitted from the Sin of Idolatry? We all grant, that if he had ſuch clear Information about theſe things as we Proteſtants have; he would certainly be an <hi>Idolater</hi> if he ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in theſe Practices: But whether his belief, and Opinion, and perſwaſion concerning theſe things, do not excuſe him; and make that ceaſe to be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that would otherwiſe be ſo; This I ſay is the queſtion. But yet none of us make any great queſtion of it. For we do charge the <hi>Papiſts</hi> indiſcriminately, with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in their Worſhip; notwithſtanding their diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; notwithſtanding their Profeſſion to Worſhip God, no otherwiſe than according to his own Will; notwithſtanding they do really take themſelves Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Conſcience to give Divine Worſhip to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:230"/> Elements, and thoſe other Objects. And we charge them rightly in this. For if it <hi>be really</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by Gods word, to do theſe things; then it will be Idolatry in any Man to do them, let his Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them be what it Will. A Mans Ignorance, or miſtake, or falſe Opinion doth not alter the nature of things; it can neither make that ceaſe to be a Duty, which God hath Commanded, nor that ceaſe to be a Sin which God hath Forbidden. All that it will do, is, that according to the Nature and Circumſtances of it, it may more or leſs Extenuate the Tranſgreſſion that is committed upon the Account thereof.</p>
                        <p>And the Caſe is juſt the ſame in the matter before us. For any Man to withdraw his Communion from that Church, with which he ought, and with which he may Lawfully Communicate; That is as properly the Sin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as it is the Sin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to give Divine Worſhip to that which is not God. For any Man, therefore, to break the Unity of the Church; though it be upon this very Account, that he doth believe it is his Duty ſo to do; or that he cannot Communicate with that Church without Sin: Yet if this perſwaſion of his be falſe, and Erroneous; he is no leſs a <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> for all this; than the other Man is an <hi>Idolater</hi> that thinks it his Duty to adore Images, and thoſe other undue Objects of Divine Worſhip among the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> It is true, the Mans Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Miſperſwaſion will according to the greater or leſs <hi>Culpability</hi> of it; more or leſs excuſe the Mans Perſon before God, as it doth in the other Caſe. But it cannot in the leaſt make that which God hath made to be <hi>Schiſm</hi> to be no <hi>Schiſm;</hi> no more than in the other Caſe, it makes that to be no <hi>Idolatry</hi> which Gods word hath declared to be <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Well now admitting all this; here comes the pinch of the thing. It will be ſaid, What, would you have a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:231"/> Man do in this Caſe? He cannot conform with a ſafe Conſcience; and yet he is a Tranſgreſſor if he do not. If he comply againſt his Conſcience, you grant he is guilty of Sin in ſo doing: If he doth not Comply; then you ſay he is a <hi>Schiſmatick;</hi> and ſo is a Sinner upon that Account. Why to this I ſay, that both theſe things are often true; and here is that <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which Men by Suffering their minds to be abuſed with Evil Principles, and Perſwaſions, do frequently run themſelves into. They are reduced to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity that they can neither Act, nor forbear Acting: They can neither Obey, nor Diſobey without Sin.</p>
                        <p>But what is to be done in this Caſe? I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this: That all Imaginable Care is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the Error and falſe Principles which miſled the Man be depoſed; and that his Judgment be better informed; and then he may both do his Duty which Gods Law requireth of him, and avoid Sinning againſt his Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>But how is this to be done? Why no other way, but by uſing Conſcientiouſly all thoſe means which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence will Recommend to a Man, for the gaining Inſtruction and Information to himſelf about any point that he deſires throughly to underſtand. That is to ſay, Freeing his Mind from all Pride, and Paſſion, and Intereſt, and all other carnal Prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and applying himſelf ſeriouſly and impartially to the getting right Notions and Sentiments about his Duty in theſe matters: Conſidering without prejudice what can be ſaid on both ſides: Calling in the beſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the ableſt and wiſeſt Men that he can come by: And above all things ſeriouſly endeavouring to underſtand the Nature and Spirit of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and to practice all that he is undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:231"/> to be his Duty: And for the matters in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, moſt earneſtly imploring the Aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit to guide and direct him.</p>
                        <p>Well, but ſuppoſing a Man has endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Judgment as well as he can, and hath uſed all thoſe Prudent means that were in his Power, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf of the Lawfulneſs of our Communion; But yet after all, he is of the ſame perſwaſion that he was, <hi>viz.</hi> That he cannot joyn in our Worſhip without Sin: what will we ſay to ſuch a Man as this? Will we ſtill ſay that this Man muſt either Conform, though againſt his Conſcience; or he is a <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> before God? This is the great difficulty, and I have two things to ſay to it.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, we do heartily wiſh that this was the Caſe of all, or of the moſt of our Diſſenters, <hi>(viz.</hi> that they had done what they can, to ſatisfie themſelves about our Communion.) For if it was, I do verily perſwade my ſelf that there would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be an end of all thoſe much to be lamented <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> which do now give ſo much Scandal to all good Men, and threaten the Ruin of our Reformed Religion; And this poor Church of <hi>England,</hi> which hath ſo long Laboured and Groaned, under the furious Attacques that have been made upon her, by Enemies without, and Enemies within her own Bowels, would in a little time, be perfectly ſet free from all apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Danger, at the leaſt from the one ſort of her Adverſaries.</p>
                        <p>If all our Brethren of the Separation would moſt ſeriouſly <hi>follow after the things that make for Peace,</hi> and <hi>walk by the ſame Rule</hi> as far as they were able, and in things <hi>where they were otherwiſe minded,</hi> would Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly apply themſelves to God for direction; and to the uſe of Prudent means for Satisfaction: I doubt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:232"/> not but the Face of things would preſently be changed among us; and we ſhould near no more of any Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or <hi>Schiſm</hi> in our Nation, that was either dangerous to the Church, or to the Salvation of the Men that were concerned in it.</p>
                        <p>But alas, we fear we have too great reaſon to ſay, that the generality of our Diſſenting Brethren, even thoſe of them that Plead Conſcience for their Separation, have not done their Duty in this matter; have not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily endeavoured to ſatisfie their Minds about the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of <hi>Conformity</hi> in thoſe Points which they ſtick at.</p>
                        <p>If they had; one would think that after all their endeavours they ſhould, before they pronounced <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> to be unlawful, be able to produce ſome one plain Text of Scripture for the proving it ſo, either in the whole or in any part of it; but this they are not able to do. They do indeed produce ſome Texts of Scripture which they think do make for them: But really they are ſuch, that if they had not ſupinely taken up their meaning upon truſt; but would have been at the pains of carefully examining them; and uſing ſuch helps as they have every where at hand for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them: It would have been ſomewhat difficult for them to have expounded thoſe Texts in ſuch a ſenſe as would infer the unlawfulneſs of our Communion.</p>
                        <p>But further I ſay, it is not probable that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Diſſenters, who condemn our Communion as unlawful, have ever anxiouſly applied themſelves to the conſidering the Point, or gaining Satisfaction about it; becauſe they do not ſeem to have much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted their own Teachers in this affair, and much leſs thoſe of our way. If they had, they would have been diſpoſed to think better of our Communion; than they do: For not to mention what the Churchmen do teach &amp; preſs in this matter; the moſt Eminent of their own Miniſters, are ready thus far to give their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52190:232"/> to our Communion. That there is nothing required in it, but what a <hi>Lay-Perſon</hi> may Honeſtly and Lawfully comply with; though there may be ſome things incovenient, and which they wiſh were amended. Nay they themſelves are ready upon occaſion to afford us their Company, in all the inſtances of <hi>Lay-Communion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I deſire not to enlarge upon this Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an Invidious one. All that I ſay is, that we wiſh it was not too apparent by many Evidences, that moſt of thoſe who ſeparate from us, are ſo far from having done all they can to bring themſelves to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with our Church Conſtitutions; that they have done little or nothing at all towards it: But have taken up their Opinions, hand over head, without much thinking or enquiring, and having once taken up an Opinion, they adhere to it, without ſcarce ſo much as once thinking, that it is poſſible for them to be in the wrong.</p>
                        <p>If you ſpeak of a Man that may with reaſon be ſaid to have done his endeavour to ſatisfie himſelf about the Points of his Duty in this matter: Give us ſuch a one; as hath no end, no intereſt to ſerve by his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but only to Pleaſe God, and to go to Heaven; and who in the choice of the way that leads thither, hath the Indifference of a Traveller; to whom it is all one, whether his way light on the right Hand, or on the left; being only concerned that it be the way which leads to his Journeys end.</p>
                        <p>Give us a Man, that concerns himſelf as little as you pleaſe, in the Speculative Diſputes, and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion: But yet is wonderfully Solicitous about the Practice of his Duty; and therefore will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe no pains or trouble that may give him a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that.</p>
                        <p>Give us a Man, that in the midſt of the great Heats, and Diviſions, and different Communions of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:233"/> the Church; is yet modeſt, and humble, and docible: That believes he may be miſtaken, and that his private Friends may be miſtaken too, and hath ſuch an Eſteem and Reverence for the Wiſdom of his Governours in Church or State; as to admit that it is probable they may ſee farther into matters of State and Religion, than he doth: And that therefore every Tenent, and Opinion that was inbibed in his Education; that was infuſed by private Men of his acquaintance; or that was eſpouſed upon a very few thoughts, and little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; ought not to be ſo ſtifly maintained; as to control, or to be ſet in Oppoſition to the Publick Eſtabliſhments of Authority.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, give us a Man, that where the Publick Laws do run counter to his private Sentiments; and he is at a loſs to reconcile his Duty to Men, with his Duty to God: Yet doth not preſently upon this, ſet up a Flag of Defiance to Authority; but rather applies himſelf with all the Indifference, and Honeſty he can, to get a true Information of theſe matters: And to that end he Prays to God continually for his aſſiſtance, he calls in the beſt helps, and conſults the beſt guides he can; his Ears are open to what both ſides can ſay for themſelves; and he is as willing to read a Book which is writ againſt his Opinion, as one that defends it: In a word if he be prejudiced, or biaſſed any way; it is on the ſide of Authority; being rather de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>rous to find himſelf miſtaken, and his Governours in the Right; than himſelf in the Right, and his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>taken. I ſay ſhew us ſuch a Man as this; and we readily grant, you have produced a Perſon, that doth ſincerely uſe his endeavours to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the Lawfulneſs of our Communion. But then we muſt ſay this alſo; that as the Caſe ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Diſſenters;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52190:233"/> we can hardly believe, that ſuch a Man will long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Separation from the Church; but will in a little time gain the Satisfaction of ſeeing, not only that he may Lawfully joyn with us, but alſo that it is his Duty ſo to do.</p>
                        <p>But let us admit, that a Man may have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Inform his Judgment as well as he can; and yet be ſo far from being convinced that it is his Duty to joyn with us in our Worſhip; that he is ſtill of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that it is his Duty to Separate from us: What will we ſay of ſuch a Man? Will we ſtill brand him for a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> notwithſtanding he hath done all he can, to bring himſelf over to us; but cannot?</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer in the ſecond Place, according to the Principles I have before laid down, that if ſuch a Caſe do ever happen; though the Man cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as to the <hi>matter</hi> of it (becauſe wherever there is an Actual Separation from a Church, with which we ought, and with which we may, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Communicate; there is an Actual Schiſm Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced; let the pretence for the Separation be what it will:) yet I truſt he ſhall not be charged before God, with the <hi>Formal</hi> guilt of the <hi>Schiſm;</hi> any farther than the <hi>Error</hi> that led him into it, was contracted by his own fault.</p>
                        <p>Though <hi>Schiſm</hi> in it ſelf (as we have ſaid) be a great Sin: yet we do not ſay that all thoſe who are engaged in the ſame <hi>Schiſm,</hi> are <hi>equally</hi> Guilty before God.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, thoſe that ſeparate from the Church, to ſerve any private ſecular turn; theſe are moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly guilty of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and there is nothing to be ſaid in their excuſe.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Place, thoſe who ſeparate from the Church, through miſperſwaſions, and miſtakes of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52190:234"/> Judgment, which they groundleſsly, and fooliſhly took up; and might have avoided; and would yet ſtill certainly correct in themſelves, if they were but ſo Careful, and Conſcientious about their Duty as they ought to be: Theſe Men, have indeed far more to ſay for themſelves, than the former; but yet they are very blameable, and are bound as they Love their Souls, to take more Care of Informing their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence aright; that ſo they may leave that Sin they are engaged in.</p>
                        <p>But Thirdly, thoſe that ſeparate from the Church of God, becauſe they know no better, nor never had means to know better: Or thoſe that have ſincerely endeavoured to underſtand their Duty as much as could be expected from one in their Circumſtances; yet through weakneſs of underſtanding, or want of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, light into wrong Paths: In a word, thoſe that are unhappily engaged in a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> but God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty who ſearcheth the Hearts, knoweth, that it is not through the Fault of their Wills, but the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of their Circumſtances: I ſay, if there be any Man among us that is in this Condition; though he be a <hi>Schiſmatick Materially;</hi> yet he is <hi>Innocently,</hi> at leaſt, <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiably</hi> ſo. And if he be as free from blame in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of his Life; be may be a good Chriſtian for all that. And God Almighty we hope who Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of Men by their inward Sincerity, and not by their outward Circumſtances; will impute that <hi>Schiſm</hi> (which in others perhaps is a <hi>wilful</hi> Crime) to this Man, no otherwiſe then as a pure <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which ſhall not (upon a general Repentance for all Sins known and unknown,) be accounted for at the laſt day. Eſpecially if this Innocently miſtaken Man we ſpeak of, do to the other Regularities of his Life, add a diligent Care in theſe four following Points.</p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52190:234"/>
                        <p>Firſt, that he be not <hi>Obſtinate,</hi> and <hi>Pertinacious</hi> in his way, but that he keep his mind readily prepared and diſpoſed to receive any Conviction, which God by any Means or Inſtruments ſhall offer to him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That he Separate no farther from the Church, of which he ought to be a Member, than he needs muſt; but do chearfully comply with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Laws, and Eſtabliſhments in all thoſe Inſtances, where he is Satisfied he may do it with a ſafe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that where he cannot give <hi>Active</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws; he do in thoſe Inſtances <hi>Patiently,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianly,</hi> ſubmit to the Penalties, which thoſe Laws inflict: Neither exclaiming againſt his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or the Magiſtrates, as Perſecutors; for enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Executing thoſe Laws: Nor uſing any undue, Illegal means to get himſelf more eaſe and Liberty: But in all things behaving himſelf as a quiet and peaceable Subject to the Government he lives under.</p>
                        <p>And Fourthly, and laſtly, that he ſhew himſelf a good <hi>Neighbour</hi> as well as a good <hi>Subject;</hi> in avoiding all peeviſh and bitter Cenſures of thoſe that differ in Opinion, and perſwaſion from him; and Exerciſing Humanity, and Friendlineſs, and Charity to all his Fellow Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>Whoſoever I ſay, of our Brethren, of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make good theſe Points: That is to ſay, are in the firſt place, very ſincere in their endeavours, to inform their Conſcience aright in the matter of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And in the next place, when they cannot Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Conſcience about our way; do yet in their Diſſent from us, Obſerve the four Particulars I have now named: I ſhould be loth for my part to Cenſure them either as ill <hi>Men,</hi> or ill <hi>Subjects,</hi> or ill <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But then all that I have ſaid in this matter, doth no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52190:235"/> more juſtifie the Sin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> or Extenuate the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of it in its own Nature; Than it would ſerve to juſtifie or Extenuate the Sin of Idolatry; if all that I have now ſaid, was applied to the Caſe of an Ignorant, well meaning, devout Papiſt. For I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe that what I have now repreſented by way of Apology for an innocent miſtaken <hi>Separatiſt;</hi> will hold true, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> in the Caſe of a deluded <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> who is invincibly, and without any fault of his, intangled in the Practice of their <hi>Idolatries.</hi> But I believe for all that, the Sin of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is in it ſelf a moſt grievous Sin, and ſo I believe is the Sin of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and therefore notwithſtanding all that may be ſaid; concerning the Innocence, or Excuſeableneſs of ſome Mens miſtakes about theſe matters; yet nevertheleſs, it infinitely concerns every Perſon, to have a care how he be engaged, either in the one, or the other.</p>
                        <p>To come to a concluſion, that which I would moſt ſeriouſly preſs from what hath been ſaid is this. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the foregoing Diſcourſe, how abſolutely neceſſary it is; that every Man ſhould endeavour to inform his Judgment aright in the matters that offend his Conſcience; before he withdraw his Obedience from his Lawful Governours, and his Communion from thoſe that Worſhip God in Publick under them. It appears likewiſe that it is not enough to juſtifie a Mans Separation; that this or the other thing in our Worſhip, is really againſt his Conſcience; for he may be a great Sinner notwithſtanding that, for leaving our Aſſemblies, if it ſhould prove at laſt that he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in his Notions.</p>
                        <p>What therefore ſhould every Diſſenter among us do, that hath any regard to his Duty, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a good Conſcience? I ſay, what is there that more concerns him to do? than preſently to ſet about
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52190:235"/> the true informing of his Judgment in the points where he is now diſſatisfi'd; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ear he be found to live in a grievous Sin all the time he Separates from us.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, let no Man that Lives out of our Communion, ſatisfie himſelf with ſuch frivolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as theſe: That as for all the <hi>Subſtantials</hi> of Religion, the matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Life,</hi> they do agree with us; and that as for the other matters which concern <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> theſe are Nice, Controverted Points; Points diſputed <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra</hi> amongſt the Divines: And therefore why ſhould they trouble their Heads about them; nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if they ſhould, they have neither Abilities nor Opportunities to underſtand them.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be confeſſed that ſomething of this is true; But yet it is nothing to their purpoſe. It is very well, that we all agree in the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> and it would be happy if all the Chriſtian World did ſo too: But ſtill Schiſm is a dreadful Sin: And a Man may as certainly, without Repentance, be damned for that, as for being an <hi>Heretick</hi> in his <hi>Opinion,</hi> or a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> for inſtance, in his <hi>Manners.</hi> Sure I am, the Ancient Chriſtian Fathers thought ſo.</p>
                        <p>It is true likewiſe, that the buſineſs of <hi>Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and other Points of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> is a matter of Diſpute, and Controverſy among us: But who is it that made it ſo? The Church of <hi>England</hi> without doubt, would have been very well pleaſed, if there had been no duſt raiſed, no diſpute or contentions moved in theſe matters; but that every Member would have done his Duty peaceably, and quietly in his Station: Or that if any Controverſy had aroſe; it ſhould have been debated among Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52190:236"/> Men; and never have proceeded to Separation from the Communion.</p>
                        <p>We do not pretend to lay any ſtreſs upon Skill, and Knowledg about theſe matters, in Order to a Mans Salvation. We believe, and teach that a Man may be a very good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and go to Heaven; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood how to juſtifie the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or to defend the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> againſt all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that are made againſt it. All that we ſay is, that if any Man will ſcruple, and except againſt the uſe of theſe things; it lyes upon him, nay he is bound as he would keep a good Conſcience, to uſe the beſt means he poſſibly can, to get Satisfaction about them: Or if he do not; at his own Peril be it, nay even at the Peril of his Salvation, if he breaks the Churches <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> upon that Account.</p>
                        <p>And as for thoſe that pretend, that theſe are <hi>Subtil</hi> Points, and above their Reach, and Capacity; and they have not <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> enough to dive into them: Why, in Gods Name, who deſires them? We ſay that they might Innocently enough, and with a good Conſcience, comply with their Governours in theſe Points, as they do in a hundred others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever diving into them; But ſince, it ſeems, they have <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> enough, to cavil and find fault with theſe things, and upon that Account, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Obedience to thoſe Lawful Powers, which God hath ſet over them: One would think they ſhould at the ſame time have ſo much <hi>Honeſty,</hi> as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to endeavour to give themſelves Satisfaction as to thoſe things they find fault with: And this is all we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them: And it is for their own ſakes too; as well as ours, that we deſire it. For otherwiſe they will never be able to anſwer either to God or Man, for the horrible Inconveniences, and miſchiefs, that ariſe to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52190:236"/> the Church of Chriſt, by the Diviſion, and Separation which they are engaged in.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, if in any Inſtance, that Famous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Apoſtle, of <hi>proving all things, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt that which is good,</hi> do Oblige Chriſtians; it doth eſpecially in this. If ever it be a Mans Duty to ſatisfie himſelf, about the goodneſs, and Lawfulneſs of a thing, that he is apt to doubt of; it is certainly in the Caſe, where his Superiours have laid their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon him: For there he cannot diſobey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin; unleſs he can aſſure himſelf that he hath done all that he can, to reconcile their Commands with his Duty to God; but upon the beſt means he hath uſed, he finds them irreconcileable. For a Man to diſobey till he has done this, is an unwarrantable thing, and in the Caſe that I now ſpeak of, it is no leſs than the Sin of <hi>Formal Criminal Schiſm.</hi>

                        <head>THE CASE OF A <hi>Doubting Conſcience.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>I Have in a former Diſcourſe ſpoken to the Caſe of thoſe Diſſenters who ſeparate from the Eſtabliſhed Church for this Reaſon, That they are <hi>Perſwaded</hi> that they cannot Lawfully joyn in our Communion. I now come to ſpeak to the Caſe of thoſe who ſeparate from us for a leſs Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they <hi>Doubt</hi> whether they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Communicate with us or no; and ſo long as they thus <hi>Doubt,</hi> they dare not come near us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fear they ſhould ſin againſt God, if they ſhould do any Action with a <hi>doubting Conſcience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this indeed a ſhort Anſwer might be given from the former Diſcourſe, and that is this, That let the Obligation of a <hi>doubting Conſcience</hi> be as great as we can reaſonably ſuppoſe it, yet if Communion with our Church as it is Eſtabliſhed be really a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then a Mans <hi>Doubts</hi> concerning the Lawfulneſs of it, will not make it ceaſe to be ſo, or juſtifie his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from it. For if a Mansſetled <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> that an Action is unlawful, will not ordinarily acquit him from Sin if he omit that Action, ſuppoſing Gods
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:239"/> Law hath commanded it (as I there ſhew'd); much leſs will a mans bare <hi>Doubt</hi> concerning the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an Action, juſtifie his Omiſſion of it in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe this Anſwer ſeems rather to cut the Knot, than to unty it; it is my meaning in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, particularly to examine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs this Plea of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> and to ſhew what little force there is in it to keep any man from Conformity, that would otherwiſe Conform. Hoping that ſome Reader whoſe Caſe this is, may, by what he here finds offer'd toward his ſatisfaction, either be prevail'd with to lay aſide his Doubts in the matter of our Communion, or at leaſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that it is more reaſonable and ſafe to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with us doubting as he doth, than to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſeparation from us.</p>
                        <p>In handling this Caſe of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> I ſhall obſerve the ſame Method I did in the former Diſcourſe, becauſe indeed I cannot think of a better. That is, I ſhall endeavour to give an account of theſe four things:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>I. Of the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> and how it is diſtinguiſhed from the other Kinds of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>II. Of the <hi>Rule</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> or what Meaſures a man is to proceed by for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining himſelf in a doubtful Caſe.</item>
                           <item>III. Of the <hi>Power</hi> that <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, have to <hi>Over-rule</hi> a mans <hi>Doubts</hi> in any matter.</item>
                           <item>IV. Of the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience, i. e.</hi> Whether at all, or how far a man is <hi>Obliged</hi> by it?</item>
                        </list>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:239"/>
                        <p>Theſe four Heads do, I think, take in all the Difficulties that are in the Caſe of a Doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                        <p>I. I begin with the firſt Head, The <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience.</hi> In ſpeaking to which, I ſhall Treat of theſe three things. 1. Of <hi>Doubting</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. 2. Of ſuch <hi>Doubts</hi> as do affect or concern a Mans <hi>Conſcience.</hi> 3. Of the Difference between the <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>Scrupulous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the firſt of theſe, which is concerning the Nature of <hi>Doubting</hi> in general, we may take Notice, That a man is properly ſaid to <hi>doubt,</hi> when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give his Aſſent to either part of a Contradiction, that is, cannot make a Judgment whether the thing he is conſidering, be ſo, or be not ſo; but through the equal, or at leaſt fair probability that is on both ſides of the Queſtion, continues irreſolute and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; now, perhaps, he thinks this Side the more probable, and by and by the other, but he is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as to both, and cannot fix upon either.</p>
                        <p>So that a <hi>Doubting</hi> Mind is not more uſually than properly, reſembled to a <hi>Ballance,</hi> which by Reaſon of the equal Weight which is put into both Scales, is not caſt on either ſide, but hangs in the ſame Poſture, or waves up and down, without either Scale coming to the bottom.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, in a doubtful Caſe, a man may lean more to one ſide of the Queſtion than the other, and yet continue doubtful ſtill. Juſt as there may be ſo much more Weight put into one Scale than the other, as will be ſufficient to incline the Ballance more to that ſide; while yet that Weight is not ſo conſiderable as to be able perfectly to turn it, ſo as to carry down the Scale to the uſual mark of Down-Weight, and there to ſettle it.</p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:240"/>
                        <p>There is indeed this difference between theſe two things, that a Ballance through the exact equality of the Weights put into each Scale, may be ſo poiſed, as to hang perfectly in <hi>oequilibrio,</hi> without inclination either way, and continue ſo to do: but it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, if not impoſſible, to put a Caſe or a Queſtion, where a mans Mind, after all things conſidered, is ſo perfectly indifferent to both ſides of it, as not to be more inclined to chuſe one, than the other.</p>
                        <p>When once there appears ſo much more Evidence on one ſide of the doubtful Caſe, that the Mind is enabled to determine it ſelf, and to give a ſettled aſſent on that ſide, then the man ceaſeth to doubt any longer; for that which was a <hi>Doubt</hi> before, is now turned into a <hi>Perſwaſion.</hi> And if it be a Caſe wherein Conſcience is concern'd, that which was before a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is now changed into a <hi>Reſolved</hi> Conſcience. Here, to reſume our former Compariſon, the Ballance no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hangs in <hi>oequilibrio,</hi> or moves unſetledly this way or that way, but is plainly turned and fixed on one ſide.</p>
                        <p>It is true, in this Caſe a man doth not always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine himſelf with the ſame degree of Perſwaſion, or Satisfaction to his own Mind. Sometimes the Evidence is ſo ſtrong, as to command an entire Aſſent of his Underſtanding; an Aſſent ſo full, that it hath not the leaſt mixture of doubtfulneſs in it; and this we call an <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> or a <hi>full Perſwaſion.</hi> At other times, the Evidence may be of force enough to gain an Aſſent, but yet not ſo ſtrong an Aſſent as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all Doubt of the contrary; and this kind of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we call an <hi>Opinion,</hi> or a <hi>probable Perſwaſion.</hi> And ſomething like this we may obſerve in the Ballance: The Scale that preponderates, is not alwayes carried down with the ſame Force and Briskneſs; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:240"/> as the Weight that turns the Ballance is greater or leſs, ſo in proportion it may plainly be diſcern'd that the Scale deſcends eithe more ſtrongly and nimb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more weakly and ſlowly. But ſtill, in both theſe Caſes, the man hath formed a Judgment of the Point; the Ballance is turned, and where ever this happens, there is an end of the Doubt or <hi>Aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and conſequently, if it be in a Caſe that concerns a mans Conſcience, it ceaſes to be any longer a Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcience, and becomes reſolved and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though perhaps not fully ſatisfied and free from all kind of doubt and ſcruple about that thing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And thus much of <hi>Doubting</hi> in general. I now come to conſider it with Reſpect to <hi>Conſcience,</hi> i. e. to enquire How far, or in what Caſes a mans Conſcience is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his Doubts? Which is our ſecond Point under this Head.</p>
                        <p>There are a thouſand Caſes in which a man may be doubtful, as to which his Conſcience ſhall be no way concerned. A mans Doubts may indeed be as various as are the Objects he hath to conſider, and to make a judgment of; and therefore unleſs we will ſay, that every thing that a man thinks of, or ſaith, or doth, affects his Conſcience, we muſt not ſay that every Doubt doth.</p>
                        <p>As a mans Conſcience is not touched, nor affected with any thing but his own Actions; ſo neither do a mans Doubts affect or touch his Conſcience any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they concern his Actions. So that Doubts about matters of meer <hi>Speculation,</hi> (as whether ſuch a Propoſition be true or falſe,) and likewiſe Doubts about matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> (as, whether ſuch a thing was done or not done,) which do not relate to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mans own Actions, theſe doubts do not concern his Conſcience.</p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:241"/>
                        <p>As a mans Conſcience is not affected with his own Actions under any other Notion, or Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than only as Gods Law is to regulate them, <hi>viz.</hi> as they are either commanded by that Law, or forbidden by it: ſo neither do a mans Doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Actions affect his Conſcience any farther, or upon any other account, than only as Gods Law may be tranſgreſſed by doing or not doing the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he doubts of; that is, as he may ſin againſt God, either by omitting the Action when Gods Law hath commanded it, or by doing it when Gods Law hath forbidden it.</p>
                        <p>So that in all doubtful Caſes, where a man appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends no danger of tranſgreſſing Gods Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he doth the Action he doubts about, or doth it not, there his Conſcience is not properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                        <p>And this is ſo true, that though we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one ſide of the Action in queſtion to be really, all things conſidered, more expedient and more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than the other, yet ſo long as we are ſatisfied that we may without breach of Gods Law chuſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, we are not concern'd in Conſcience to chuſe that ſide which is the moſt expedient, or the moſt eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. For the truth of this, beſides the reaſon of the thing, we have the authority of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who when this Caſe was propoſed to him, Whether it was better for the Chriſtians in thoſe times to marry, or not to marry? he thus reſolves it, That though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as things then ſtood, it was better not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet they might do what they would; for if they did marry, they ſinned not: and though (as he ſaith) <hi>he that gave not his Virgin in marriage did bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he that gave her in marriage;</hi> yet he allowes, that <hi>he that gave her in marriage did well,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:241"/> conſequently did act with a good Conſcience. <hi>Vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From what hath been ſaid, we may be able to give a clear account of the Nature of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> and to diſtinguiſh it from the other ſorts of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; particularly, that which they call the <hi>Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;</hi> which is our Third Point under this Head.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Conſcience</hi> is uſually, though how properly I will not now diſpute, diſtributed into theſe three Kinds, the <hi>Reſolved,</hi> the <hi>Scrupulous,</hi> and the <hi>Doubting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When we ſpeak of a <hi>Reſolved</hi> Conſcience, every body knows that we mean no more by that Phraſe than this, that a man is ſatisfied and reſolved in his own Mind, concerning the action he hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is bound to <hi>do</hi> it, as being a <hi>Duty;</hi> or that he is bound to <hi>forbear</hi> it, as being a <hi>Sin;</hi> or, that he may either <hi>do</hi> it, or <hi>forbear</hi> it, as being an <hi>Indifferent</hi> action, neither commanded, nor forbidden by God. Now this Perſwaſion, if it be according to the Rule of the Divine Law, we call it a <hi>Right</hi> Conſcience. If it be contrary to that Rule, we call it an <hi>Erroneous</hi> Conſcience: But of this we need ſpeak no more here, ſince it was the whole argument of the former Diſcouſe.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Scrupulous</hi> Conſcience, as that is made a diſtinct ſort of Conſcience from the <hi>Reſolved</hi> and the <hi>Doubting,</hi> we may thus define it: <hi>It is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in ſome meaſure reſolved, but yet accompanied with a Fear of acting according to that Reſolution.</hi> It is the unhappineſs of a great many, that when they are pretty well ſatisfied in their Judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this or the other Point, which they made a Matter of Conſcience, and have nothing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Object againſt the Evidence that is given them, but on the contrary are convinced that they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:242"/> ought, or that they may lawfully Act thus or thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet for all that, when they come to act, they are very uneaſie, and make a World of Difficulties. Not that there is any new Reaſon appears that can pretend to unſettle, much leſs overthrow the Grounds of their firſt Determination: But only their unaccountable <hi>Fears</hi> muſt paſs for <hi>Reaſons.</hi> This now is to have a <hi>Scrupulous</hi> Conſcience in the proper Senſe.</p>
                        <p>But a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience, (which is that we are now concerned in,) though in Common Speech it be often confounded with the <hi>Scrupulous,</hi> is quite different from both theſe ſorts of Conſcience. For in both thoſe a man is ſuppoſed to have paſſed a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his own Mind whether the Action before him be according to Gods Law, or againſt it. But in the Caſe of a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience, it appears from what I have ſaid, that a man hath not, nor cannot, ſo long as he doubts, make any Judgment at all, but is uncertain as to both ſides; having, as he thinks, as many Arguments to incline him one way, as the other; and when once he comes to have ſo much Evidence as to create a <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> or <hi>Opinion</hi> on one ſide, then he ceaſeth to have a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>So that the True Definition of a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as it is commonly called, is this. <hi>The Suſpence of a mans Judgment in a Queſtion about the Duty or the Sin of an Action, occaſioned by the Equal (or near Equal) Probalities on both ſides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And likewiſe the true Difference between a <hi>Doubting,</hi> a <hi>Reſolved,</hi> and a <hi>Scrupulous</hi> Conſcience, is this; That the <hi>Reſolved</hi> Conſcience is ſatisfied about its Point, and acts <hi>confidently,</hi> at leaſt <hi>chearfully:</hi> The <hi>Scrupulous</hi> Conſcience is likewiſe ſatisfied in the general, but either dares not act, or acts <hi>fearfully.</hi> The <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience is not ſatisfied at all, for the Point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:242"/> it is ſtill a <hi>Queſtion;</hi> of which it can make no Judgment, no Reſolution, becauſe of the equal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Reaſon on both ſides.</p>
                        <p>This is a plain account of the <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience. But after all, it muſt be acknowledged, that this which we call a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience, and which we have been all this while diſcourſing of, is, truly and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, ſo far from being any particular ſort or kind of Conſcience, as we have hitherto ſuppoſed it, that it is no Conſcience at all.</p>
                        <p>Conſcience, as we have often ſaid, is a <hi>Mans Mind making a Judgment about the Morality of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> But that which we are now talking of, is a <hi>mans Mind making no Judgment</hi> as to that Point, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing wavering and undetermined. Now how a mans <hi>Judgment</hi> and his <hi>no Judgment,</hi> which are the Contradictories to one another, ſhould agree in the ſame Common Nature of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> is not eaſie to be underſtood. The Truth is, by the ſame Logick or propriety of Speech, that we ſay a <hi>Doubting</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, we may alſo if we pleaſe ſay an <hi>unreſolved</hi> Reſolution, or a <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> without an <hi>Aſſent.</hi> But however, becauſe Uſe hath given the Name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the <hi>Doubting</hi> Mind; and becauſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſometimes really concerned about Acting in <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, I chuſe to follow the common way of ſpeaking.</p>
                        <p>II. I now proceed to our <hi>Second</hi> general Head, which is concerning the <hi>Rule</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In ſpeaking to this, I ſhall do theſe two things. <hi>viz.</hi> I ſhall ſhew,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, What <hi>kind of Rule</hi> we here ſpeak of, that is, which Conſcience needs in a Doubtful Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, What that <hi>Rule</hi> is, or wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:243"/>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the firſt of theſe. When we ſpeak of the <hi>Rule</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> we do not mean ſuch a Rule by which a man ſhall be enabled to reſolve all his <hi>Doubts</hi> concerning every Point, ſo as that he ſhall ceaſe to doubt any longer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Point: But we mean only ſuch a <hi>Rule</hi> by which a man may be directed how to determine himſelf in every <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſe, ſo as to act with a ſafe Conſcience, whether he can get rid of his <hi>Doubts</hi> or not.</p>
                        <p>There is juſt as much difference between theſe two things, as there is between <hi>Doubting,</hi> for Inſtance, whether a thing in general be lawful, or not lawful; and <hi>Doubting</hi> what I am to do in a particular Caſe, where I doubt of the Lawfulneſs of the thing. The firſt of which <hi>Doubts,</hi> the Caſuiſts call a <hi>Speculative Doubt,</hi> the other a <hi>Practical.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is plain, that a man may often very eaſily come to a Reſolution of this latter kind of <hi>Doubt;</hi> that is, be very well ſatisfied what it becomes him to do as to this preſent Action, without being able to reſolve his <hi>Doubt</hi> of the former kind.</p>
                        <p>Thus, for inſtance, a man may not be able to reſolve this Queſtion, Whether it be lawful or not lawful to play at Cards or Dice? which is the <hi>ſpeculative</hi> doubt, as the Schools call it: But he may be very able to reſolve this Queſtion, What is moſt reaſonable for him to do in the Caſe of ſuch a Doubt? Again, a man may not be able to reſolve this Doubt, Whether the preſent War in which his Prince is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, be a juſt War or no? But yet he may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well able to ſatisfie himſelf as to the <hi>practical</hi> Doubt; that is, What is his Duty to do in caſe his Prince command him to ſerve in that War, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he doth thus doubt?</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:243"/>
                        <p>Now it is the Doubts of this latter kind, theſe <hi>Practical</hi> Doubts, as they are call'd, that Conſcience is directly and immediately concerned with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, for the reſolving of which, it chiefly needs a Rule to direct it. For if a man can but get ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied what is moſt agreeable to his Duty to do, as to the preſent Action he doubts about, it is no great matter as to his Conſcience, whether he can get his <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Speculative</hi> Doubts about that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſolved or no. Theſe kind of Doubts, if they cannot be <hi>Reſolved,</hi> muſt be <hi>Over-ruled.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The truth is, it is a very idle thing for men to talk, that a man muſt do no Action, till all his Doubts about it be reſolved. Thus far we grant it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him, that his Doubts ſhould be reſolved, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould be ſatisfied in his own mind, that that ſide of the Action he determines himſelf to, is, all things conſidered, the more fit and reaſonable to be choſen: And to direct a Man in making ſuch a Choice, is our principal buſineſs under this Head. But if it be meant, that a Man muſt ſo reſolve all his Doubts about an Action, as to ſee clearly through all the Speculative Points which occaſion his Doubts, ſo as to be able to untie all the Difficulties which before entangled his Underſtanding, and from Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Arguments, drawn from the nature of the thing, to pronounce concerning the merits of the Queſtion: I ſay, if this be their meaning, there is nothing more abſurd than to ſay, That a man is not to do an Action till he has reſolved or depoſed all his Doubts about it.</p>
                        <p>For in many Caſes this is utterly impoſſible to be done; the perſon concerned perhaps having no ſufficient Means for the obtaining ſuch a Reſolution of his Doubts as we ſpoke of; or if he had, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:244"/> Caſe may be ſuch as will not allow him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time of Conſideration for the doing it; for he muſt either act or not act preſently; and he is in equal Perplexity, both as to the one, and as to the other. What now in ſuch a Caſe can a Man poſſibly do more than this? <hi>viz.</hi> by his own Reaſon, and the advice of his Friends, to get ſatisfied what is moſt reaſonable, and moſt agreeable to his Duty, for him to do in the preſent Circumſtances, and to proceed accordingly; for as for other kind of Reſolution of his Doubts, as things ſtand with him, he hath not the leaſt Proſpect of it.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, when all is ſaid, we ſee <hi>de facto</hi> that this is the uſual way of proceeding among Men, even thoſe that are very Honeſt and Conſcientious. I dare ſay, if we take all the Doubtful Caſes that happen; where there is one Caſe in which a Man proceeds to Action upon ſuch a Reſolution of his Doubts as we before ſpoke of, there are ten Caſes where the Doubt is <hi>over-ruled,</hi> and the Man proceeds to Action without ſuch a Reſolution; ſitting down ſatisfied with this, that though he cannot anſwer the Difficulties on both ſides, yet, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is moſt reaſonable for him, in the preſent Circumſtances, to act thus, rather than otherwiſe; for this he takes to be moſt agreeable to his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duty; or this is that which Wiſe and Good Men, whom he hath conſulted, do adviſe him to.</p>
                        <p>And now having ſufficiently explained what kind of Reſolution of Doubts that is, which a Mans Conſcience ſtands in need of in order to his acting ſafely in a doubtful Caſe,</p>
                        <p n="2">II. I come now to the ſecond Queſtion upon this Head, which is, What that <hi>Rule</hi> is by which we are to proceed in thus Reſolving our <hi>Doubts,</hi> or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:244"/> determining our ſelves to one ſide or other, in any Doubtful Caſe that happens to us.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to this Enquiry, I ſhall do theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall give ſome account of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Rule by which a <hi>Doubting Conſcience</hi> is to be guided. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall apply this General Rule to the ſeveral Heads, of Doubtful Caſes wherein a mans Conſcience may be concerned: That ſo every one may be furniſhed with ſome Principles, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining himſelf in any Matter concerning which he happens to have a <hi>Doubt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the firſt of theſe, Whoever hath Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what we have before ſaid, will eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that nothing ought to turn the <hi>Ballance</hi> in a Doubtful Caſe, but the greater Weight of <hi>Reaſon</hi> on one ſide than the other. For ſince the very Notion of Doubting, is <hi>the ſuſpence of a mans Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a Queſtion, upon account of the equal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Reaſon on both ſides of it:</hi> It is plain, that that which is to ſettle the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the <hi>Doubt</hi> can be nothing elſe but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That, after all things conſidered, there doth appear greater <hi>Reaſon</hi> to lye on this ſide of the Queſtion, than there doth on that. So that the General Rule of a Doubting Conſcience, and from which the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of reſolving all particular Caſes are to be taken, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be laid down otherwiſe than thus. <hi>viz. That in all Doubtful Caſes, that ſide which, all things duely conſidered, doth appear more reaſonable, that is to be choſen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I am not ignorant that the Caſuiſts have uſually propoſed this Rule in other Terms. <hi>viz. That in all Doubtful Caſes the ſafer ſide is to be followed.</hi> But I do purpoſely avoid the expreſſing it ſo, becauſe of the <hi>uncertain</hi> meaning of the <hi>ſafer ſide?</hi> For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:245"/> as that Word is expounded, (as it may be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded different waies), ſo is the Rule ſo worded true or falſe.</p>
                        <p>If we take <hi>ſafety</hi> in the ſtrict and proper Senſe, and as it is indeed uſually underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is oppoſed to any <hi>Hazard</hi> or <hi>Danger:</hi> it is ſo far from being an Adaequate Rule of a Doubting Conſcience, in all Caſes to follow the <hi>ſafer ſide,</hi> that in many Caſes it will be very unadviſable ſo to do.</p>
                        <p>Sure I am, that in Doubtful Caſes which concern the <hi>Civil</hi> Life, no Wiſe man doth alwaies make this a Rule to himſelf. We ſee a hundred Inſtances eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, where men venture upon the leſs <hi>ſafe</hi> and the more <hi>hazardous</hi> ſide, upon the account of other Reaſons and conſiderations, which they think ought more to prevail with them.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly, in general ſpeaking, more <hi>ſafe</hi> (that is, more free from <hi>hazard</hi> or <hi>danger)</hi> to Travel on <hi>Foot,</hi> than on <hi>Horſeback;</hi> to ſtay at <hi>home,</hi> than to go into <hi>Foreign Countries;</hi> to Traffick by <hi>Land,</hi> than to venture ones Stock on the uncertain <hi>Seas.</hi> But yet for all this, the conſideration of the Eaſe and Expedition that is to be had in the firſt Caſe, and the Improvement and Benefit that is to be hoped for in the ſecond, and the Gain and Profit in the laſt, do we ſee every day overballance the conſideration of <hi>Safety</hi> in theſe Caſes, and determine a man not to that ſide which is freeſt from <hi>Danger,</hi> but to that which is more <hi>Convenient,</hi> or more <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful,</hi> or more <hi>Advantageous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus it is likewiſe as to thoſe <hi>Doubtful Caſes</hi> wherein a mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> is concerned. I ſuppoſe that when we ſpeak of the <hi>ſafer ſide</hi> of any Action with reference to <hi>Conſcience,</hi> we generally mean that ſide on which there appears the leaſt <hi>Hazard</hi> or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:245"/> 
                           <hi>Danger</hi> of tranſgreſſing any Law of God. But now in this Senſe of <hi>ſafety,</hi> I do not think that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a good Rule, for a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience to chuſe the <hi>ſafer ſide:</hi> On the contrary, I think, that if the Rule be thus put, and thus underſtood, it will often prove a Snare to a mans Mind, and rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle him further in Difficulties, than help him out of them.</p>
                        <p>If it was receiv'd as a Rule, That a man is in all his Actions to keep himſelf at the greateſt diſtance he can from the Danger of ſinning, (which is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ſafety</hi> I here ſpeak of), I dare ſay, there are very few Perſons that converſe much in the World, but have reaſon, almoſt every day, to call themſelves to account for tranſgreſſing this Rule. For they do every day ingage in ſuch Actions, in which they cannot but acknowledge that they do expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a greater danger of ſinning, than if they had not ingaged in them.</p>
                        <p>Thus, for inſtance, what man is there among us who, although he know himſelf to be prone enough to the ſin of <hi>Intemperance</hi> in eating or drinking when Temptations are offered, and accordingly for this reaſon doth moſt ſeriouſly ſet himſelf againſt this particular ſin; yet makes any great Scruple of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Entertainments</hi> when he is invited by others; nay or of making them himſelf, when <hi>Decency</hi> or <hi>Civility,</hi> or the ſerving any of his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> affairs doth require him ſo to do? But yet it is certain, that by thus doing, he runs a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hazard of falling into the ſin he fears, than if he ſhould forbear all ſuch Occaſions or Temptations of Intemperance.</p>
                        <p>Many other Inſtances which daily occur in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life might be given, wherein good men, nay
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:246"/> even the beſt of men, do for the ſake of their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or other Laudable Deſigns which they think fit to purſue, frequently venture to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch <hi>dangers</hi> of ſinning as they might have avoided; and this without any Reproach from their own Conſcience, or any Cenſure from other Men.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, God hath no where commanded us to avoid all poſſible <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>ſinning,</hi> but onely to avoid all <hi>ſin</hi> when we are in <hi>danger.</hi> It is enough for the ſecuring a mans Duty, that he doth not tranſgreſs the Laws of God in any Action that he takes in hand: But it is not required that he ſhould in every inſtance of his Converſation, preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the utmoſt poſſibility, or, (if you will) Danger of ſo doing. For upon this Suppoſition, it would be impoſſible for one to live like a man of this World, and perform the common Offices of Civil Life, and much more to live to any great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for the ſerving his Generation. Indeed the Reſult of all would be, That whoever would approve himſelf to be truly <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Conſcientious,</hi> muſt abandon all Secular Affairs, and retire to a Cloyſter or a Deſart.</p>
                        <p>But it may be ſaid, What is this to our Buſineſs? Thoſe we now ſpoke of are ſuppoſed to be fully ſatisfied in their own Minds, that they may ſafely venture on the more dangerous ſide of an Action, for the ſake of ſome conſiderable good that they deſign in that Action: But the Caſe we are now concerned in, is that of one who is altogether Doubtful whether he may Lawfully do the Action or no. To this I anſwer, That my Buſineſs is now to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Rule by which men are to proceed, in determining themſelves in Doubtful Caſes; and that which I have ſaid, doth thus far I think come home
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:246"/> to that Buſineſs, that if it be allowed that it is adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in any Caſe to forſake the more <hi>ſafe</hi> ſide of an Action, and to chuſe the more <hi>hazardous:</hi> we will take it for granted, that it may be as adviſable in a <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſe as in any other, untill it be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that God hath apointed a Rule for <hi>Doubting</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to govern themſelves by, different from that he hath given to other men: Or, to ſpeak the thing more plainly, till it be made to appear, that thoſe who are ſo unhappy as to <hi>Doubt,</hi> are debarred of the priviledge of Acting according to the beſt of their <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> which men that do not <hi>Doubt</hi> are allowed to do.</p>
                        <p>But to come more ſtrictly to the Point. I do believe there do abundance of <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, properly ſo called, frequently happen, in which no Man of Underſtanding, although we ſuppoſe him never ſo Honeſt, doth think he is obliged to determine himſelf to that ſide of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which he apprehends there is leaſt Danger of ſinning: But on the contrary, he will often forſake that ſide which is <hi>ſafer</hi> in this ſenſe, for that which doth more recommend it ſelf to him upon other Accounts.</p>
                        <p>Thus for inſtance, ſome times <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes do happen, in which the greater <hi>Probability</hi> on one ſide, will turn the Ballance againſt the greater <hi>Safety</hi> on the other. Thus if a Man ſhould <hi>Doubt</hi> whether it may be Lawful to eat any thing <hi>Strangled,</hi> or that hath <hi>Bloud</hi> in it, (becauſe there are ſome Paſſages in the Scripture that ſeem to forbid theſe Meats); and ſhould repair to ſome intelligent Perſon about this matter, who ſhould give him ſuch an account of thoſe Texts, and of all the other Difficulties in this Affair, that the Man comes away ſatisfied, that it is far more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that all kinds of Meats are allowed by the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:247"/> Chriſtian Religion, than that any are forbidden.</p>
                        <p>I ask now, Whether this degree of Satisfaction have not weight enough to put an end to a Mans Doubt in ſuch a Caſe as this, ſo as that he may with a quiet Conſcience eat of theſe Meats as there is occaſion? I believe moſt Men will be of this Opinion; but yet the Doubt here is not determined on the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſide, but on the more <hi>unſafe.</hi> For it is certain, a Man is in leſs Danger of ſinning, if he wholly forbear theſe Meats, than if, for the ſerving a preſent Convenience, he do eat of them. And the Reaſon is plain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are fair Grounds from the Scripture, and Antiquity, for making it a <hi>Queſtion</hi> whether theſe Meats be Lawful or no; and it is really yet a <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> among many, and it was lately ſo to the Man himſelf: But no man in the World ever made a <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> whether theſe Meats might not at any time be Lawfully forborn; there being no Law of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that obliges a Man to eat of them.</p>
                        <p>Again, As a greater <hi>Probability</hi> will turn the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſide of a Doubt: So oftentimes ſuch Doubtful Caſes do happen, in which, when the <hi>Probabilities</hi> are equal on both ſides, the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greater <hi>Temporal Advantages</hi> on the one ſide, will have Weight enough with a very Honeſt Man to over-ballance the Conſideration of the greater <hi>Safety</hi> on the other. [Still taking <hi>Safety</hi> in the ſenſe we before gave.]</p>
                        <p>Thus for Inſtance, Suppoſe one ſhould demand of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man a Sum of Money which he pretends to be due to him, and the Man of whom it is demanded, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtricteſt and moſt conſcientious Enquiry he can make, is not ſatisfied in his own mind that it is due. But ſuch is the Confidence of the Demander, and ſuch appearances of Reaſon he offers, that the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:247"/> Man comes to doubt <hi>equally,</hi> whether it be due or no; ſo that there are here equal <hi>Probabilities</hi> on both ſides. The thing in Queſtion now is, Whether it be adviſable in point of Conſcience for the Man to pay the Money demanded, till he have better Evidence of the Juſtice of the Demands?</p>
                        <p>If a Man be to follow the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſide, it is certain he muſt pay it. For it is undeniably more ſafe, that is, farther removed from the Danger of Sin, to ſatisfie the Demands, though it be to his own loſs. For by this means he perfectly ſets himſelf free from the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions even of the poſſibility of wronging his Neighbour, which is the ſin that he fears in this Caſe: Whereas if he do not pay the Money, he is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether he detains the Mans Right from him or no.</p>
                        <p>But then, on the other hand, if he ſhould pay the money when it is no way due, (as he hath as much Reaſon to believe that it is not due, as that it is), how ſhall he anſwer to his Wife and Children for part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch a Sum, which, as his Circumſtances may be, he cannot ſpare without great prejudice to them?</p>
                        <p>This is the Caſe, and theſe are the Arguments that are to be urged on both ſides of it, And I leave it to any conſidering Man to judge which ought to prevail. I am pretty confident, that moſt Men will thus determine, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince in this Caſe it is as Probable, that the Demands aforeſaid are <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> as that they are <hi>Juſt;</hi> and ſince no man is <hi>obliged</hi> to depart from that he is poſſeſſed of, till it do appear by good Evidence that it is due to another Man: And ſince withal it is <hi>unreaſonable</hi> ſo to do, when it will be to the Prejudice of a Mans Self and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: Theſe things being ſo, it will be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable for the Man in this Caſe to keep his Money,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:248"/> till it be either by Law adjudged, or he have more convincing Proofs to his own Conſcience, that he ought to pay it.</p>
                        <p>I think I need not uſe either more Inſtances, or more Words, to ſhew that it is not alwaies a <hi>Rule</hi> to a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience to chuſe the <hi>ſafer ſide</hi> of the Doubt, taking the <hi>ſafer ſide</hi> for that which is at the greateſt diſtance from the danger of ſinning: It being abundantly plain, that many Doubtful Caſes may, and do happen, in which, though one ſide may appear farther removed from the Danger of tranſgreſſing Gods Law; yet while it doth not appear that the other ſide is <hi>unlawful,</hi> and withal it is evident that upon other accounts that ſide is more eligible to a Prudent Perſon, no good Man (if he be but as <hi>Wiſe</hi> as he is <hi>Good)</hi> will make any Difficulty of waveing the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſide for the more <hi>Prudent,</hi> and that without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ever the leſs <hi>Conſcientious</hi> for ſo doing.</p>
                        <p>But after all this, If on the other hand, any man have another Notion of <hi>Safety</hi> than that we have now been ſpeaking of; that is to ſay, will enlarge the ſignification of the Word, and will call by the name of the <hi>Safer ſide,</hi> not that which hath only this to recommend it, that it is <hi>farther removed from the danger of ſinning;</hi> but that which is <hi>freeſt from all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Inconveniences of all kinds whatſoever:</hi> So as that ſhall alwaies be the <hi>Safer ſide</hi> of a <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſe, which, after all things conſidered, doth appear to be moſt agreeable to the Mans <hi>Duty</hi> in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he is in, or which is attended with the feweſt <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and evil <hi>Conſequences</hi> of all ſorts, and doth beſt ſerve all the Intereſts <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> taken both together, that a <hi>Wiſe</hi> and a <hi>Good</hi> Man can propoſe to himſelf: I ſay if any man do mean this by the <hi>Safer ſide,</hi> I do readily agree with him, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:248"/> it will for ever, and in all Caſes, be a <hi>True,</hi> and a <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and a <hi>Good</hi> Rule (nay, I add), the <hi>only</hi> one, to a <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Conſcience to follow the <hi>ſafer ſide.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But then, in this ſenſe of <hi>Safety,</hi> the <hi>ſafer ſide</hi> and the <hi>more Reaſonable</hi> is all one thing. And conſequently, this Rule of following the <hi>ſafer ſide,</hi> and that I before laid down, of following the <hi>more Reaſonable,</hi> are the ſame in ſenſe, through differently expreſſed. Only I think this latter way of expreſſion is more plain, and leſs liable to miſconſtruction, and therefore I choſe it. But it is indifferent to me how Men <hi>Word</hi> things, ſo long as we agree in our <hi>Senſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. Having thus given an Account of the <hi>General Rule</hi> by which a man is to determine himſelf in <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Caſes; I come now, in the <hi>Second</hi> place, to treat of the ſeveral Heads, or Sorts of <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, wherein a Mans Conſcience is concerned, and to make Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>Rule</hi> to them; and this it will be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do, admitting the Grounds we have before laid down.</p>
                        <p>There is no <hi>Doubt</hi> wherein <hi>Conſcience</hi> is concerned, but it will of neceſſity fall under one of theſe two Sorts. It is either a <hi>Single</hi> Doubt, or a <hi>Double</hi> one.</p>
                        <p>We call that a <hi>Single Doubt,</hi> when a man doubts only on <hi>one</hi> ſide of the Action, but is very well ſatisfied as to the <hi>other.</hi> As for Inſtance, he doubts concerning this or the other particular Action, whether it be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to do it: But on the other ſide, he hath no Doubt, but is very well aſſured, that he may Lawfully <hi>let it alone.</hi> Or, on the contrary, he is very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that the Action is Lawful, and that he may <hi>do it:</hi> But he doubts whether Gods Law hath not made it a Duty, ſo that he cannot Lawfully <hi>omit</hi> it. This is that which we call a <hi>Single Doubt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We call that a <hi>Double Doubt,</hi> where a man doubts on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:249"/> 
                           <hi>both</hi> ſides of an Action, that is to ſay, he doubts on one ſide whether he be not bound to <hi>do</hi> this Action; Gods Law, for any thing he knows, made it a <hi>Duty:</hi> But on the other ſide, ſo is the Action circumſtantiated with reſpect to him, or he with reſpect to it; that he doubts whether he be not bound to <hi>forbear</hi> the Action as it is now preſented to him; Gods Law having for any thing he knows <hi>forbid</hi> it. So that he is at a loſs what to do, becauſe he fears he may ſin, whether he doth the Action or doth it not. I ſay, it will be impoſſible to put any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſe wherein a mans Conſcience is concerned, which will not fall under one of theſe two Heads.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. Now, as to the Caſe of a <hi>Single Doubt,</hi> we may thus apply the <hi>General Rule.</hi> That when a man doubts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>one</hi> ſide of an Action, there it is more <hi>Reaſonable</hi> to chuſe that ſide of the Action concerning which he hath no Doubt, than the <hi>other,</hi> concerning which he Doubts, ſuppoſing all other Conſiderations be equal.</p>
                        <p>And here comes in that famous Maxim which hath obtained both among Chriſtians and Heathens, <hi>Quod dubitas ne feceris;</hi> which, with the reſtriction I have now mentioned, will for ever be good Advice in all Caſes of this Nature.</p>
                        <p>It muſt needs be unreaſonable to venture upon any Action where a man hath the leaſt <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Suſpicion</hi> that it is <hi>poſſible</hi> he may tranſgreſs ſome Law of God by it, when it is in his power to Act without any <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Suſpicion</hi> of that kind; ſuppoſing all along this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the poſſibility of offending by this Action, be not over-ballanced, and ſo the <hi>Fear</hi> of it removed, by other Conſiderations which the Circumſtances of the Action do ſuggeſt.</p>
                        <p>Thus for Inſtance. Here is a Man Doubts whether it be allowable in a Chriſtian to <hi>drink</hi> a <hi>Health,</hi> or <hi>put out Money to Intereſt,</hi> or to <hi>go to Law;</hi> as having
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:249"/> converſed with ſuch Men, or ſuch Books as do condemn theſe Practices, and that not without ſome Colour from the Word of God. The man is not indeed ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by their Diſcourſes, as to have taken up any <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi> or <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> that theſe Practices are unlawful; nor would he cenſure any man that uſes them, becauſe he ſees there are as Good <hi>Men,</hi> and for any thing he knows, as good <hi>Arguments</hi> for the other ſide: But he is not ſo clear in his judgment about theſe Points, as to be able to pronounce any thing poſitively concerning them either way. He cannot ſay, that he believes them <hi>Lawful,</hi> though he is not perſwaded that they are <hi>unlawful,</hi> which is the true ſtate of a <hi>Doubting</hi> mind. Now in theſe and all other ſuch like Caſes the Rule is plain, That while a mans judgment continues thus in ſuſpence, it is more Reaſonable for him to forbear theſe Practices. For there is no pretence of obligation upon him from Gods Law to engage in any of them, and why ſhould he raſhly throw himſelf into danger, by venturing upon an Action concerning which he is uncertain whether it be Lawful or no? He runs no hazard by forbearing theſe things; but if he practiſe them, he doth.</p>
                        <p>Thus far is right. But then, as I ſaid, this is always to be underſtood with this Proviſo, <hi>Caeteris paribus.</hi> For if there ſhould happen to be ſuch other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Action, as have force enough to over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance this Conſideration of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty;</hi> it will then be reaſonable to chuſe that ſide of the Action concerning which I did before doubt, rather than that of which I had no doubt at all.</p>
                        <p>Thus if the Man that makes a Queſtion about any of the three things I before mentioned, ſhould light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Circumſtances, that, for Inſtance, he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drink ſuch a ſingle <hi>Health,</hi> or a quarrel is like to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:250"/> enſue, nay, and that perhaps to the danger of ſome of the Lives of the Company. Or again, that he has no means of improving his Money (in which his whole Fortune conſiſts) in any other way but by that of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury;</hi> ſo that he and his Family muſt in time ſtarve, unleſs they be maintained by this Courſe. Or laſtly, if an Orphan be truſted to his Care; and the Eſtate of that Orphan is ſo entangled, that he muſt be put upon the neceſſity either of waging a <hi>Law Suit</hi> for the clearing it, or ſuffering his near Relation, committed to his Charge, to be defrauded of his Right. I ſay, if the Caſes happen to be thus circumſtantiated; he that before doubted in General, whether it was Lawful to <hi>drink a Health,</hi> or to <hi>put out money to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> or to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in Law-Suits;</hi> may, I ſhould think, certainly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf, that it is not only <hi>Lawful,</hi> but <hi>Expedient</hi> in this particular Caſe, notwithſtanding his General Doubt, to do any of theſe things; and if he be a Wiſe Man, he will make no Scruple of Acting accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Indeed he cannot be well excuſed if he do not thus Act. For it will not be ſufficient to ſay, I doubt whether theſe Practices are <hi>Lawful</hi> or <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> and therefore I dare not ingage in them. Why Man? if you only <hi>Doubt</hi> about them, you do by this ackonwledge, that for any thing you know they may be <hi>Lawful,</hi> as well as that for any thing you know they may be <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful.</hi> And if you be thus <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> ſure ſuch preſſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations as thoſe which are preſented in this Caſe, ought to turn the Ballance. Otherwiſe I do not know how you will anſwer either to your ſelf or the World for the Conſequences that may enſue. For my part, in ſuch Caſes as theſe I ſhould think, that nothing leſs than a <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> that the thing in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is unlawful, will juſtifie a mans Prudence in Acting on that ſide which he calls the <hi>Safer,</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:250"/> which, had not theſe Circumſtances happened, would really have been ſo.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, if a great <hi>Good</hi> may be compaſſed, or a great <hi>Evil</hi> may be avoided, by doing a thing concerning which we have a <hi>General Speculative Doubt</hi> whether it be Lawful or no: This very Conſideration is in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient to ſilence the Doubt: That is, it is enough to perſwade us, that it is not only <hi>Lawful</hi> but <hi>Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable</hi> to do that in the preſent Circumſtances, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and out of thoſe Circumſtances, we Doubted in general whether it was Lawful to be done or no.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And thus much concerning the Rule by which we are to proceed in the Caſe of a <hi>Single Doubt,</hi> I now come to conſider that which we call a <hi>Double Doubt,</hi> and to ſhew what is to be done in that Caſe.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Double Doubt,</hi> as I have ſaid, is this, when a man doubts on <hi>both</hi> ſides of an Action; that is to ſay, he doubts on one ſide whether he be not bound to <hi>do</hi> this Action, Gods Law having for any thing he knows commanded it; but on the other ſide, ſo doth the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come circumſtantiated to him, that he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be not by ſome other Law of God bound to <hi>forbear</hi> it as it is now offer'd: So that he is at a loſs what to do, becauſe he fears he may ſin whether he do the Action, or do it not.</p>
                        <p>That which is commonly ſaid in this Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Man that is entangled muſt get his Doubt remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and then he may with a ſafe Conſcience act or not act, according as he is ſatisfied in his own mind; is, as I ſaid before, very often impertinent: For it is no more in a mans power to leave off Doubting when he will, than it is in the power of a <hi>Sick</hi> man to be <hi>Well</hi> when he will. And beſides, though it might be ſuppoſed, that the man with <hi>Time</hi> and good <hi>Counſel</hi> might be enabled to extricate himſelf out of this Perplexity; yet in our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:251"/> Caſe that Benefit is not always allowed: For perhaps the Circumſtances of the Caſe are ſuch, that the man is under a preſent neceſſity either of acting or not acting, and whether he doth the one or the other, he doubts he offends God.</p>
                        <p>But what then is a man to do in this Caſe? Why, he is to follow the ſame <hi>Rule</hi> that he doth in all other <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Caſes, and which we have been all this while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on; that is to ſay, he is to <hi>Act as reaſonably as he can:</hi> And if he do this, I am ſure he incurs no blame, whether he do the Action he doubts about, or do it not. If there ſhould happen to be any ſin in the Action, it comes upon ſome other account than that of Acting with a <hi>Doubting Conſcience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But now the Application of this <hi>General Rule</hi> to our preſent Caſe is various, according to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the mans <hi>Doubtfulneſs,</hi> compared with the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the <hi>ſin</hi> he is in danger of, by acting on the one ſide or the other. And likewiſe according as other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do happen about the Action, which ought to have ſome influence in determining the man. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I think all thoſe varieties may be comprized in theſe <hi>Four</hi> following Propoſitions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the <hi>Sin</hi> we are afraid of, in doing or not doing the Action, doth on both ſides appear <hi>equal,</hi> there we are to determine our ſelves to that ſide where we have the leaſt <hi>Doubt</hi> of offending God; that is to ſay, to that ſide which to our Reaſon appears <hi>more Probable</hi> to be free from the dnager of ſin, rather than that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is <hi>leſs Probable</hi> to be free from that danger: For certainly this will always be reaſonable, <hi>that a man ſhould chuſe a greater Probability before a leſs,</hi> ſuppoſing all other things equal.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we doubt <hi>equally</hi> on both ſides; ſo that we apprehend that we are in like danger of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:251"/> tranſgreſſing Gods Law whether we do the Action or do it not: In this Caſe we are to determine our ſelves to that ſide on which it doth appear we ſhall be guilty of the <hi>leaſt ſin.</hi> For certainly, <hi>by the ſame reaſon for which we are obliged not to ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>n at all, we ſhall be obliged to chuſe a leſs ſin rather than a greater, where we annot cavoid ſinning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the <hi>Doubt</hi> be <hi>unequal,</hi> and the <hi>Sin</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>unequal;</hi> that is, if it ſo happen that one ſide of the Caſe is more <hi>probable,</hi> but the other ſide <hi>leſs ſinful,</hi> as not involving a man in ſo heinous a <hi>Crime</hi> as the other would, if it ſhould prove that he was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: In this Caſe a man may chuſe either the one ſide or the other; according as the degree of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,</hi> or the degree of the <hi>Sin,</hi> compared with one another, do preponderate.</p>
                        <p>The Caſe may be ſuch, that there is ſo much more <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> on the one ſide than the other, and likewiſe ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a difference and diſproportion between the <hi>ſins</hi> we are in danger of on each ſide, that a Wiſe man will be determined to the more <hi>Probable</hi> ſide, and venture all the conſequences of his miſtakes on the other.</p>
                        <p>But then, on the other hand, the Caſe may likewiſe be ſuch, that the <hi>Conſequences</hi> on one ſide, if a man ſhould happen to be miſtaken, are ſo terrible, that they will over-ballance all the <hi>Probabilities</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, let them be never ſo great; (ſuppoſing they do not amount to ſo much evidence as to create a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,</hi> and ſo put a man out of the ſtate of <hi>Doubting).</hi> Now here a Wiſe man will not Act on the more <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> ſide, but on that which ſets him free from the danger of theſe Conſequences. Thus if a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was tryed for a Capital Offence, and the Evidence againſt him doth not appear ſo full as to create a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi> in the Judge or Jury that the man is Guilty,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:252"/> though indeed it is more <hi>Probable</hi> that he is, than that he is not: In this Caſe I believe all men will ſay, that conſidering there is ſo great a diſproportion between the Evil of condemning an <hi>Innocent Perſon</hi> and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Guilty</hi> one, (it being Murder in the one Caſe) the Judge or Jury ſhould rather follow the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſide than the more <hi>Probable,</hi> and ſo <hi>clear</hi> the man, rather than find him <hi>Guilty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Caſe be ſuch, that the Man <hi>doubts equally</hi> on both ſides, and the <hi>ſin</hi> he is afraid of appears likewiſe to him to be <hi>equal</hi> on both ſides: Here other Conſiderations are to turn the Ballance. In this Caſe he is to conſider what <hi>Prudential</hi> Inducements he has to do the Action, or forbear it; as how far his <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Quiet,</hi> his <hi>Advantage</hi> and <hi>Benefit,</hi> his <hi>good Name</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> his <hi>Friends</hi> or his <hi>Family</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned one way or other; and ſince all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that are of a <hi>Moral</hi> Nature, are <hi>equal</hi> on both ſides; thoſe of this kind, which are the ſtrongeſt, muſt add ſo much weight to the Scale, as to determine the Man either to do the Action he doubts about, or to let it alone.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, it cannot be denyed that theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations will often have a great Influence even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a good Man, not only in the Caſe I have now put, where the directly Moral Arguments are equal on both ſides, but in all the other doubtful Caſes I before mentioned.</p>
                        <p>We may talk very rationally about the <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Probability,</hi> and the <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and what weight each of them is to have with us, and all this with ſo much Evidence, that no Man can deny the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Rules we lay down <hi>in Theſi:</hi> But yet when we come to Act, we find that ſcarce any Man doth exactly proceed according to theſe Rules; but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:252"/> mixes ſome of theſe <hi>Prudential</hi> Conſiderations which I have mentioned with his Deliberations, and though they do not wholly, yet they help to turn the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. And for my part, I dare not ſay, that all thoſe who thus proceed, are to be blamed for ſo doing; ſuppoſing that the Caſe wherein they thus Act, be a Caſe of <hi>pure Doubt,</hi> and there be no <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> on either ſide; and withal, that the Man who thus proceeds, is ſatisfied in his own Mind with his proceeding. The truth is, when all is ſaid, every Man in doubtful Caſes is left to his own Diſcretion; and if he Acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt Reaſon he hath, he is not culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though he be miſtaken in his Meaſures.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are all the Rules that are to be given in the Caſe of a <hi>Double Doubt.</hi> And I think no body can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of them. But I am ſenſible of another Objection that may be made, and that is, Why I do mention them at all. Since to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men, for whom this Diſcourſe is intended, they ſeem altogether unpracticable. For how few are there who are Competent Judges of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees of <hi>Probability</hi> or <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> in an Action that we here talk of, and much leſs are capable of ſo ballancing theſe things one with another, as to be able from thence to form a good Judgment upon the whole Matter?</p>
                        <p>But to this I anſwer, That if <hi>Rules</hi> are to be given at all for the determining Men in <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, we muſt give theſe, becauſe we can give no other. Theſe being the only <hi>Principles</hi> that Men have to govern their Actions by in theſe Caſes. And I truſt alſo, they will not be wholly uſeleſs to the moſt ordinary Capacities, for the Purpoſes they are intended. Becauſe all may hereby at leaſt learn thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> What Methods they are to proceed by for the guidance of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:253"/> their Actions in Doubtful Caſes. And though they may have falſe Notions of the <hi>Dangers</hi> and the <hi>Degrees</hi> of particular Sins, and ſo may ſometimes make falſe Applications of theſe Rules to their own Caſe; yet it is enough for their Juſtification, as I ſaid before, that they have <hi>Reaſoned</hi> as well as they can. Since they are not bound to Act in Doubtful Caſes, according to what is <hi>beſt</hi> and moſt reaſonable in it ſelf: But it is abundantly ſufficient, that they do endeavour it.</p>
                        <p>But to render theſe Rules about a <hi>Double Doubt</hi> more intelligible and more uſeful, I think it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to give my Reader a <hi>Specimen,</hi> both how they are to be applyed to particular Caſes, and likewiſe when they are applyed, what light they give to a Man for the chuſing his way in any Doubtful Caſe he happens to be ingaged in. And ſince it would take up too much room to give every particular Rule a ſeveral Inſtance, I ſhall pitch upon one Caſe, under which I may conſider all the <hi>Varieties</hi> of a <hi>Double Doubt</hi> I have now repreſented; and it ſhall be that <hi>Celebrated</hi> Caſe of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> than which we have not a greater or a more frequent Inſtance of this kind of Doubt in any Caſe among us. And becauſe I would not by the diſcuſſion of this Caſe, divert my Reader (againſt his will) from the main Argument, I have taken care to have it ſo marked in the Print, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may without trouble (if he have no mind to read it) paſs it over as a long Parentheſis, and go on to the next Point.</p>
                        <p>This is the Caſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Here is a Man that believes it to be his Duty to take all opportunities of Receiving the Sacrament, or at leaſt to take them frequently. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, ſuch is his condition, that he is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under great Fears and Apprehenſions of his being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:253"/> unqualified for it; and to receive the Sacrament <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthily</hi> he knows to be a great Sin: Not that there is any grievous notorious Sin lies upon his Conſcience unrepented of; much leſs that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſome vicious Courſe, which he is unwilling that his new Vows at his approach to the Lords Table ſhould divorce him from: For indeed he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavours <hi>in all things to live honeſtly,</hi> and <hi>to keep a Conſcience void of offence towards God and towards Man.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But this is the Caſe, He is not ſo <hi>devout</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, nor lives ſo <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> a Life, as he thinks becomes the Partakers of ſuch Heavenly Food. Or perhaps he cannot bring himſelf to ſo <hi>feeling</hi> a <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Contrition</hi> for his paſt Sins, or ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to our Saviour, as he hath been taught that every worthy Communicant ought to be affected with. Or perhaps he wants <hi>Faith</hi> in the Blood of Chriſt, not being able to apply the Benefits of his Paſſion ſo comfortably to his own Heart as he thinks he ought to do. Or perhaps, in the laſt place, his mind is ſo haunted with a company of idle and naughty Fancies, eſpecially when he ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be more than ordinarily ſerious, that he thinks it would be a great Profanation of the Sacrament, for him to come to it in ſuch Circumſtances.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Theſe, or ſuch like, are the things that trouble him. And though he hath ſeveral times endeavoured to put himſelf into a better condition, yet he could never ſatisfie himſelf, nor get over theſe difficulties. What now muſt this Man do? He would fain receive the Sacrament, as thinking himſelf bound to do it; but he dare not receive it, as looking upon himſelf to be unqualified for it. If he do not come to the Lords Table, he denies his Attendance on the moſt Solemn
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:254"/> Ordinance of Chriſtianity, and ſo doubts he ſins on that account: If he do come, he doubts he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es unworthily, and ſo ſins upon that account.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It is here to be remembred, that the Queſtion to be ſpoken to in this Caſe, is not this; What courſe the Man is to take for the Curing or Removing his Doubtfulneſs in this matter, that ſo he may come to the Sacrament with Satisfaction to his own mind: But this; Suppoſing the Man after all his endeavours cannot cure or remove his Doubt, what he muſt do? muſt he come to the Sacrament, or muſt he forbear? One of them he muſt do, and yet, which of them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he chuſeth, he fears he ſins.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If the former had been the Queſtion, the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it would have been thus: That the Man is to uſe the beſt means he can to get better Inſtruction and Information about the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of the Chriſtian Sacrament; and about the <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions</hi> that are needful to fit a man for it, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> For it is the Mans Ignorance or Miſtake about theſe things, that makes him paſs ſo hard a Cenſure upon himſelf, and ſo occaſions all the Doubtfulneſs in this Caſe. If he once come rightly to underſtand theſe Points, his Doubts would of themſelves fall to the Ground; and the Man would be perfectly ſatisfied, that as his Caſe is (ſuppoſing it to be ſuch as I have now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) he may without any Fear or Scruple in the World at any time approach to the Holy Table; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is indeed in ſuch a ſtate and diſpoſition of mind as renders him <hi>habitually</hi> qualified for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that Duty.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But this, as I ſaid, is not the Queſtion before us; we here ſuppoſe the Man, either through want of <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> or through ſtrong <hi>Prejudices</hi> from <hi>Education,</hi>
                              <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:254"/> or the like, to be incapable at preſent of this Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to be in great perplexity on both ſides; and that which we are to enquire into is, to which ſide of the doubtful Caſe he muſt determine himſelf. Shall he <hi>receive</hi> the Sacrament doubting as he doth? or ſhall he <hi>forbear</hi> it doubting as he doth?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now I ſay, a man hath no other way of coming to a Reſolution of this Queſtion, but by applying the Rules I before laid down to his preſent Caſe: which may be done in this manner.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Since the Man we ſpeak of doubteth that he ſins whether he come to the Sacrament, or forbear, the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing to be conſidered is, on which ſide he doubts <hi>leaſt;</hi> or which ſide appears to him moſt likely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be free from the danger of ſinning: For, <hi>if all other things in the Caſe be equal, the Ballance is to be turned on that ſide</hi> according to our <hi>firſt</hi> Propoſition.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now if our preſent Queſtion be put upon this Iſſue, I am confident the Man whoſe Caſe I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting will think it more reaſonable to repair to the Sacrament, even in that evil poſture he takes himſelf to be; than cuſtomarily to abſtain from it: Becauſe by thus doing, he doth certainly follow the more <hi>probable,</hi> and the leſs <hi>doubtful</hi> or <hi>dangerous</hi> ſide of the Queſtion. For it is evident, he cannot pretend to be half ſo certain of this <hi>Particular, viz.</hi> That he is <hi>unprepared</hi> for the Sacrament, which is the reaſon of his abſtaining, as he is certain in the <hi>General</hi> that it is his <hi>Duty</hi> to frequent it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If indeed the Man was a perſon of ill Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Or if he had been lately guilty of any Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Wilful Sin, and came to the Lords Table with that ſin upon his Conſcience unrepented of: Then I will grant, he had ſome reaſon to believe that he was as much in danger of ſinning, by receiving unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:255"/> as by withdrawing himſelf from Gods Ordinance. But the Caſe here is not ſo. The Man is really an honeſt well-meaning Chriſtian, nor hath he done any thing of late, which can give him any ſuſpicion of his having forfeited that Title. Only through his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake about the Notion of preparation for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he apprehends he is not qualified as he ought to be, though yet if moſt others were to be Judges of his Condition, they would ſay he was. Why? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in this Caſe, it muſt be evident to the Man that he runs a greater danger of tranſgreſſing the Law of God by abſenting himſelf from the Communion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he do it cuſtomarily; than if he ſhould come to it with all his <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Doubts</hi> about him. For, as I ſaid, his <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Doubts</hi> of his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, cannot poſſibly be ſo well grounded as his <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Doubts</hi> that he ſins againſt God by habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally denying his attendance on that great Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Service. For thoſe are founded on the expreſs Laws of the Goſpel: The others are founded onely on uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conjectural Surmiſes about his own condition. That is to ſay, he is certain that he is bound to take frequent opportunities of paying his homage to Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament; but he cannot pretend to have ſuch aſſurance in his Caſe that he is unqualified for paying that homage.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But Secondly, Let us ſuppoſe the <hi>Doubt</hi> is <hi>equal</hi> on both ſides: That is to ſay, that the Man hath as much reaſon to believe that he is an <hi>unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver</hi> if he receives at all, as he hath reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is a <hi>Sin</hi> in him if he do not receive. Which yet can hardly be ſuppoſed in our Caſe, but let us ſuppoſe it, nay, if you pleaſe, let us ſuppoſe the Man doth <hi>certainly</hi> ſin, whether he <hi>recives</hi> or <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears:</hi> Here then this comes to be conſidered; which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:255"/> of theſe two <hi>Sins</hi> is the <hi>leaſt:</hi> To <hi>Receive unworthily,</hi> yet out of a Senſe of Duty, or <hi>not to receive</hi> at all. For on which ſide ſoever this laſt ſin happens to be, to that ſide the Man is to determine himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſecond Rule. It being eternally reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>That of two Evils we ſhould chuſe the leaſt, when we cannot avoid both.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now putting the Caſe before us upon this Iſſue, there needs no more to be done for the reſolving it, than only to ask this general Queſtion.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Which is the <hi>greater ſin</hi> of theſe two; for a Man to omit a <hi>known Duty,</hi> and ſo to break a <hi>known Law</hi> of God for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake: Or to yield <hi>Obedience</hi> to that <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake, when yet it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that a Man cannot do that, without breaking another Law of God in the <hi>manner</hi> of his Performance of that <hi>Duty?</hi> For my part, I ſhould think that the Man who doth this laſt, though he cannot be ſaid to be Innocent, yet is he guilty in a far leſs <hi>degree,</hi> than the Man that practiſeth the former, and a great deal more is to be ſaid in his juſtification.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Let us ſuppoſe two Men, both of them conſcious to themſelves, that as things ſtand with them, they are not in a fit condition, ſo much as to <hi>ſay</hi> their <hi>Prayers,</hi> or to perform any other act of Religious Worſhip as they ought to do; now one of theſe Men doth upon this account forbear all <hi>Prayers</hi> both <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;</hi> neither uſing his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> nor frequenting the <hi>Church.</hi> The other hath ſuch a Senſe of what both Natural Religion and Chriſtianity do oblige him to in this matter, that he dares not forbear his uſual Offices either in <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>Private,</hi> though yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he ſinfully performs them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If the Queſtion now be put, which of theſe two is the better Man, or the leaſt Offender, I dare ſay that all men will give their Judgment in favour of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:256"/> latter, though yet no Wiſe man will think that this Perſon is to be excuſed for living at ſuch a rate, that he cannot <hi>ſay his Prayers</hi> without Sin.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This Judgment, I ſay, men would paſs in this Caſe; and there is a great deal of Reaſon for it. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no indiſpoſition that a man hath contracted, of what nature ſoever, will take off from his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey the Laws of God. If a man cannot do his Duty ſo well as he ought, he muſt at leaſt do it as well as he can. And therefore let his Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be what they will, he muſt needs be leſs <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> in performing a known Duty in the beſt <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> that his Condition will allow him, though with many and deſerved Reflections upon his own <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs,</hi> than in wholly <hi>omitting</hi> or <hi>diſuſing</hi> that Duty. Becauſe a neglect in the <hi>manner</hi> of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Duty, is a leſs fault than to neglect the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Let this now that I have ſaid be applyed to our Caſe, and we have an eaſie reſolution of the Queſtion before us. <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince a <hi>greater ſin</hi> is to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before a <hi>leſs,</hi> when a man ſuppoſes himſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of being guilty of <hi>one;</hi> it is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the man we ſpeak of, ſhould come to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with all his Doubts concerning his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, than that he ſhould cuſtomarily and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually withdraw himſelf from it, becauſe it is a greater ſin to do this latter than the former.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Well, but ſome ſay, How can this conſiſt with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine? Who expreſly affirms, That <hi>whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29.</note> 
                              <hi>Damnation to himſelf.</hi> Can there be any more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſin than that, which if a man be guilty of, it will actually <hi>Damn</hi> him? Certainly one would think by this, that a man runs a much leſs hazard in not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:256"/> at all, than in venturing to Receive whileſt he hath the leaſt Doubt that he Receives unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, conſidering the dreadful Conſequences of it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But to this I briefly anſwer. Such a man as we all along ſuppoſe in our Caſe, is in no danger at all of <hi>Receiving unworthily,</hi> in the Senſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth this Term. For the <hi>unworthy receiving</hi> that he ſo ſeverly Cenſures in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was their approaching to the Lords Table with ſo little a ſenſe of what they were about, that they made no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> between the <hi>Lords Body</hi> and <hi>common Food:</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ibid. v.</hi> 29. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21, 22.</note> But under a pretence of meeting for the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> they uſed the <hi>Church</hi> of God as if it was an <hi>Eating</hi> or <hi>Tipling</hi> Houſe: Some of them Revelling it there to that degree, that they went away <hi>Drunk</hi> from theſe Religious Aſſemblies. All this appears from the Text. But I hope none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us (eſpecially none of thoſe who are ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about their being duly qualified) do <hi>profane</hi> the Sacrament in this manner.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But further, Perhaps the <hi>Damnation</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here denounces, is not ſo frightful as is commonly apprehended. For all that he ſaith (if either the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal or the Margin of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted) will appear to be this, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Judgment to himſelf.</hi> Meaning hereby, in all probability, that he who doth thus affront our Lords Inſtiſtution, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no diſtinction between the Bread of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and common Meat; doth by this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs draw ſevere Judgments of God upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For, <hi>for this cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>many are weak and</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ver.</hi> 30.</note> 
                              <hi>ſickly among you, and many are fallen aſleep:</hi> But here is not a word of <hi>Everlaſting Damnation;</hi> much leſs of any mans being put into that State by thus <hi>receiving</hi>
                              <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:257"/> 
                              <hi>unworthily:</hi> Unleſs any man will ſay, that all thoſe who are viſited with Gods Judgments in this World, are in the State of Damnation as to the next. Which is ſo far from being true, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this very place affirms the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 32. Verſe, where he tells us, That <hi>When we are thus judged</hi> [in this World] <hi>we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the World, i. e.</hi> with Wicked men in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But further, Admitting St. <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe words to mean <hi>Damnation</hi> in the uſual Senſe, yet ſtill the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they can come to, will be no more than this: That <hi>whoſoever eateth and drinketh</hi> thus <hi>unworthily,</hi> as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, <hi>is guilty of a Damnable ſin.</hi> But now there are a great many other Caſes beſides this of the Sacrament, in which a Man is equally guilty of a <hi>Damnable</hi> Sin, if he do not perform his Duty as he ought to do. He that <hi>Prays</hi> or <hi>Hears</hi> unworthily; He that <hi>Faſts</hi> or gives <hi>Alms</hi> unworthily. In a word, He that in any Inſtance performs the Worſhip of God, or profeſſeth the Chriſtian Religion unworthily: I ſay, ſuch a Man, according to the Proteſtant Doctrine, may be ſaid to do theſe things <hi>to his own Damnation,</hi> upon the ſame account that he is ſaid to <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> his own <hi>Damnation</hi> that Communicates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily in the Sacrament; though indeed not in ſo high a degree. That is to ſay, ſuch a Man is guilty of a Sin that is in its own Nature <hi>Damnable,</hi> and may prove actually ſo to him, unleſs either by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or general Repentance he obtains Gods pardon for it. But yet for all this, there is no man will for theſe Reaſons think it adviſeable to leave off the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of theſe Duties; but the only Conſequence he will draw from hence, is, that he is ſo much the more concerned to take care that he perform them as he ought to do.</q>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:257"/>
                        <p>
                           <q>But in the laſt place. Let the ſin of coming to the Sacrament unworthily, be as great and as damnable as we reaſonably can ſuppoſe it: Yet this is that we contend for, the ſin of totally withdrawing from it, is much greater and more damnable. So that if he who partakes of it <hi>unworthily,</hi> doth <hi>eat and drink Damnation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> He that partakes not at all, is ſo far from mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, that he doth much increaſe that Damnation.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>The truth of this doth fully appear from what I have before ſpoke in General, concerning the much greater ſin of tranſgreſſing a known Law of God, than of obſerving that Law as well as we can, though with much unworthineſs. I will only add this further, with reference to this Particular of receiving the Sacrament.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Though I am far from encouraging any to approach to the Lords Table without due Qualifications; or from extenuating any mans ſin that comes unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; (unworthily I mean in the Scripture Senſe of that word, and not as it is underſtood by many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly ſcrupulous Perſons) Yet this I ſay: That if Men did ſeriouſly conſider what a ſin it is to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sacrament, it being no other, than living in an open affront to the expreſs <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of our Lord Jeſus, and a renouncing the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God and the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church, in the great Inſtance of Chriſtian Worſhip and Chriſtian Communion: And withal, what dreadful Conſequences they bring upon themſelves hereby, even the depriving themſelves of the chief of thoſe ordinary means which our Lord hath appointed for the obtaining <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of ſins, and the <hi>Grace</hi> and Influence of his <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> I ſay, if men did ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, they would not look upon it as ſo ſlight a matter, voluntarily
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:258"/> to Excommunicate themſelves as to the partaking in this great Duty and Privilege of Chriſtians; but what apprehenſions ſoever they had of the ſin, and the danger of receiving unworthily, they would for all that, think it more <hi>ſinful</hi> and more <hi>dangerous</hi> not to receive at all.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I have ſaid enough in anſwer to this Objection from St. <hi>Paul;</hi> perhaps too much, conſidering how often theſe things have been ſaid. I will now go on with our Caſe.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>In the <hi>Third</hi> place, therefore let us ſuppoſe our Doubting Man, (for theſe or ſuch like Reaſons as we have given) to have ſuch a Senſe of his Duty, that he generally takes the opportunities that are offered him, of doing Honour to our Lord, by partaking in his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, though perhaps he is not often very well ſatisfied about his Preparation: But ſo it happens, that ſince his laſt Communicating, he finds his Mind in a much worſe frame than it uſed to be. He hath lived more looſly and careleſly than he was wont; or perhaps he hath been very lately guilty of ſome grievous ſin that lies heavy upon his Conſcience: So that when his next uſual time of Receiving comes, he cannot but apprehend himſelf in a very unfit condition to Communicate in ſo ſacred a Myſtery. Upon this he is in a great perplexity what to do. For on the one ſide, he thinks he hath more reaſon to believe that he offends God if he comes to the Sacrament in theſe Circumſtances, than if he forbears; becauſe he is more certain, that there is a Law of God that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids him to come <hi>unworthily;</hi> than he is certain, that there is a Law of God that commands him to <hi>receive every time</hi> that he hath opportunity. But now, on the other hand, if it ſhould prove that he is really bound by Gods Law to Commemorate the Death
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:258"/> of Chriſt in the Sacrament, every time that an opportunity is offered; He is ſenſible in that Caſe, it is a greater ſin to neglect this Duty, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it unworthily, ſo long ſtill as he performs it out of Conſcience. What now is the Man to do in theſe Circumſtances?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This is an exact Inſtance of the Caſe I ſpoke to in my third Propoſition; where on one ſide the Man runs a greater <hi>danger</hi> of ſinning; but on the other ſide, if he ſhould prove miſtaken, he ſins in a greater <hi>degree.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now for a Reſolution of this Caſe, I ſay; That if the Queſtion be put concerning the Mans abſenting himſelf only <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> from the Communion, in order to the exerciſe of Repentance, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf into a better frame of mind, againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother opportunity: The Anſwer (according to our <hi>Third</hi> Propoſition) muſt be this, That it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thus to do.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And there is good ground for this Anſwer. For certainly a Man is more in danger of ſinning, if he receive unworthily, than if he do not receive every time that there is a Communion. There being an expreſs Law againſt the one; but no expreſs Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to the other. For Chriſt hath no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that we ſhould <hi>receive</hi> the Sacrament ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in a <hi>year;</hi> than he hath appointed that we ſhould <hi>Pray</hi> ſo many times in a <hi>day;</hi> or that we ſhould give ſuch a determinate proportion of our Annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Charitable Uſes. As to theſe things he hath bound us in the <hi>General;</hi> but as to the <hi>Particulars,</hi> the Circumſtances of our Condition, and the Laws of our Superiors are to determine us. Only this we are to remember, that the oftner we perform theſe Duties, it is the better; and we can hardly be ſaid to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:259"/> be Chriſtians if we do not perform them <hi>frequently.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This now being ſo: Though it be true, that a Man would be guilty of a greater ſin, if he ſhould at any time, though but once, abſtain from the Communion, than if he ſhould come to it with ſuch <hi>unworthineſs</hi> as we are here ſpeaking of; ſuppoſing that Chriſts Law had preciſely tied him up to communicate every time that a Communion is appointed: Yet ſince there is ſo little appearance of Reaſon to conclude that Chriſt has thus tied him up; and withal on the other hand, he runs ſo <hi>certain</hi> a <hi>danger</hi> of ſinning if he ſhould Communicate at this time, apprehending himſelf to be ſo <hi>unworthy</hi> as he doth: This Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>certain danger</hi> muſt needs in this Caſe overballance the other of the <hi>greater ſin,</hi> and make it appear more Reaſonable to the Man to ſuſpend his receiving to another Opportunity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which time he hopes to be better prepared; than to adventure upon it in his preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But then if the Queſtion be put concerning the Mans abſenting himſelf <hi>Cuſtomarily</hi> and <hi>Habitually</hi> from the Lords Table upon this account of <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs;</hi> that which I have now ſaid, will not hold. For in this Caſe, the Man is in as much <hi>danger</hi> of ſinning by not <hi>receiving at all,</hi> as by <hi>receiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,</hi> nay, and a great deal more, as I ſhewed in my <hi>firſt</hi> particular about this Caſe. And withal he is guilty of a much <hi>greater</hi> ſin in wholly withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Sacrament, than in coming to it though with never ſo great Apprehenſions of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, as I ſhewed in my <hi>ſecond.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the <hi>danger</hi> is at leaſt <hi>equal</hi> on both ſides, he muſt chuſe that ſide on which the <hi>leaſt ſin</hi> lies: That is to ſay, he muſt Communicate frequently (at
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:259"/> leaſt ſo often as the Laws of the Church do enjoin him, which is <hi>three times a year,</hi> though he be in danger of doing it unworthily; rather than not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate at all.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Having thus gone through <hi>Three</hi> of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions concerning a <hi>Double Doubt:</hi> All that remains is, to put our Caſe about the Sacrament ſo, as that it may ſerve for an Inſtance or Illuſtration of our <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Here therefore we are to ſuppoſe our Doubting Man to be in ſuch a Condition, that he apprehends he runs an <hi>equal danger of ſinning</hi> whether he receives the Sacrament, or receives it not. And withall, ſo unskilful a Judge is he of the morality of Actions, that he apprehends no great difference in the <hi>degree</hi> of the ſin, whether he do the one or the other.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>In this Caſe now, all the Man can do, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Inducements he has in Point of <hi>Prudence</hi> or <hi>Intereſt</hi> to do or to forbear the Action he doubts about; for ſince all other Conſiderations in the Caſe are <hi>equal,</hi> thoſe of this kind are to turn the Ballance, according to our <hi>Fourth</hi> Propoſition.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>But if the Caſe turn upon this Point, I dare ſay no man will be long doubtful, whether he ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Sacrament in obedience to the Laws, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it. For it is plain, that he Acts more <hi>Prudently,</hi> and more conſults his own <hi>Advantage</hi> both <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>As for the <hi>Temporal</hi> Advantages which a Man receives by obeying the Laws in this matter, I will not now inſiſt on them, though they are neither few nor inconſiderable. That which I deſire chiefly to be here conſidered, is this, That in point of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; it is much more adviſable for our Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Perſon to come to the Sacrament, than to abſtain from it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:260"/>
                        <p>
                           <q>For by frequenting this Ordinance, he takes the beſt method both to grow more <hi>worthy,</hi> if he be now <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy;</hi> and likewiſe to cure the <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> he is now troubled with. But if he neglect this means of Grace, he not only takes an effectual courſe to increaſe and perpetuate his <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Doubts</hi> (it being very probable that the longer he defers his receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament, ſtill the more <hi>doubtful</hi> will he be of his being qualified for it): But alſo is in great danger to loſe that ſenſe of Virtue and Religion that he now hath upon his Spirit; becauſe he denyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the uſe of thoſe Means and Helps which are moſt principally neceſſary for the preſerving and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Now I ſay, ſuppoſing all other things in the Caſe <hi>equal,</hi> this very Conſideration alone will prevail with a reaſonable Man to <hi>come</hi> to the Sacrament, rather than <hi>forbear</hi> it, even at the ſame time that he mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>doubts</hi> whether he ſhall not receive unworthily.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Thus have I given a large Exemplification of all our Rules concerning a <hi>Double Doubt</hi> in this inſtance of <hi>receiving the Holy Communion.</hi> If I have dwelt too long upon this Subject, I hope the Frequency and the Importance of the Caſe, will in ſome meaſure excuſe me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. Having thus prepared our way by ſettling the <hi>Notion</hi> and the <hi>Rule</hi> of a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience, I come now more directly to the main Buſineſs that is before us, and that is, to give an Account <hi>what ſhare Humane Laws, Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, have in the Rule of a Doubting Conſcience, or what Power they have to over-rule a mans Doubts in any Caſe?</hi> which, according to the method I propoſed, is the <hi>Third</hi> general Enquiry I am to reſolve.</p>
                        <p>This is indeed the great Point that is diſputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>us</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Separation.</hi> Nay, I may ſay
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:260"/> it is the Point upon which that whole Controverſie turns, ſo far as a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience is concerned in it. And therefore I ſhall diſcuſs it as carefully as I can; but yet in ſuch a general way as that what I have to offer, may ſerve for all other Doubtful Caſes of this Nature, as well as this which we are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in.</p>
                        <p>Their Aſſertion <hi>generally</hi> is this, <hi>(generally,</hi> I ſay: For there are ſome of the Diſſenters, and thoſe as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Eminent as any, who have declared themſelves of another Opinion) <hi>viz.</hi> That wherever a Man Doubts concerning the Lawfulneſs of an Action; that very <hi>Doubt</hi> of his is a ſufficient Reaſon to make him <hi>forbear</hi> that Action, though Lawful Authority hath commanded it.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, our Aſſertion is; That wherever Lawful Authority hath Commanded an Action, that <hi>Command</hi> is (generally ſpeaking) a ſufficient Warrant for a Man to do that Action, though he <hi>Doubts</hi> whether in it ſelf it be Lawful or no.</p>
                        <p>That I may ſpeak clearly to this Point; I ſhall <hi>Firſt</hi> premiſe ſome things in order to our more diſtinct un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the State of the Queſtion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the Grounds and Reaſons of our Aſſertion. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to anſwer the Chief Arguments that are brought on the other ſide.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. What I think needful to be premiſed for the right apprehending the State of the Queſtion, I ſhall compriſe in theſe following Particulars, by which it may be eaſily diſcerned how far we agree with the Diſſenters in this matter, and in what we differ from them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> We do readily own with them, that no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon Earth can oblige its Subjects to <hi>do</hi> any Action which the Law of God hath forbidden, or to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear</hi> any Action which the Law of God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:261"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We agree likewiſe with them in this; That wherever any Subject hath taken up an <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi> that ſuch an Action which his Governours have obliged him to, is againſt the Law of God; though it be a <hi>falſe</hi> Opinion or Perſwaſion, yet it will ſo far bind him, that he cannot in that Inſtance obey their Laws without offending God. But then we ſay, on the other hand, That though he cannot <hi>Obey</hi> without ſin, ſo long as this <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> continues; yet he is at the ſame time guilty of ſin in <hi>diſobeying,</hi> if he ſhould prove to be <hi>miſtaken;</hi> ſuppoſing that it was through his own fault that he fell into that <hi>miſtake.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We acknowledge further, That in a Caſe where a Man cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Perſwaded</hi> that the particular Action enjoyned by Authority is a ſinful Action; but only he <hi>Doubts</hi> whether it be ſo or no: Yet if the Man hath a general <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> that no <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Law</hi> will warrant him to act againſt his <hi>Private doubt;</hi> in this Caſe he can no more do the Action enjoyned without ſin, than he could in the former Caſe. But then if this Notion of his be falſe (as it is my preſent buſineſs to ſhew that it is ſo;) he cannot be excuſed from ſin, in <hi>diſobeying</hi> his Superiors, unleſs upon the former account of <hi>inculpable Ignorance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We ſay this farther, That a <hi>Culpable Doubt</hi> doth no more excuſe the doing an <hi>Evil</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than a <hi>Culpable Ignorance, i. e.</hi> it doth not excuſe it My meaning is this. If a man ſhould be ſo little inſtructed in his Religion, as to <hi>Doubt</hi> whether that which is <hi>plainly enjoyned</hi> by Gods Law be a <hi>Duty</hi> or no: Or whether that which is <hi>plainly forbid</hi> by Gods Law be a <hi>ſin</hi> or no: (ſo plainly, I mean, that it is the duty of every Honeſt Man to know this, and he muſt be moſt criminally <hi>Ignorant</hi> that can be ſo <hi>ſtupid</hi> as to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:261"/> make a <hi>Doubt</hi> of it). If, I ſay, in ſuch a Caſe as this a man ſhould <hi>Doubt</hi> whether the thing commanded by his Superiours was <hi>Lawful</hi> or no: We are ſo far from ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Man doth well in obeying his Superiours in ſuch an inſtance where their commands do ſo manifeſtly contradict the Laws of God; that on the contrary, we affirm the man is highly accountable to God for all ſuch Actions that he doth, though they were done purely in obedience to that Authority which God hath ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him; and purely in compliance with this Principle we are now contending for, <hi>viz.</hi> That in all Doubtful Caſes it is moſt reaſonable to govern our Actions by the Commands of our Superiours.</p>
                        <p>Far are we therefore from aſſerting, That whatever our Governours do command, the Subject is bound to perform, ſo long as he only <hi>Doubts,</hi> but is not <hi>perſwaded</hi> of the unlawfulneſs of the thing commanded: And that if there be any ſin in the Action, he that <hi>commands</hi> it is to anſwer for it, and not he that <hi>obeys.</hi> For we do believe, that in matters where a mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, every one is to be a <hi>Judge</hi> for himſelf, and muſt <hi>anſwer for</hi> himſelf. And therefore, if our Superiours do command us to do an Action which <hi>their Superiour</hi> God Almighty hath forbid; we are offenders if we do that Action, as well as they in commanding it, and that whether we do it <hi>Doubtingly,</hi> or with a <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> of its Lawfulneſs.</p>
                        <p>But then theſe <hi>two</hi> things are always to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this is true only in ſuch Caſes where (as I ſaid) a man is bound to know that Gods Law hath forbid that Action which his Governours do command, and it is either through his groſs careleſneſs, or ſome other worſe Principle in him, that he knows it not, or is doubtful of it. For wherever a man is innocently, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:262"/> inculpably <hi>Ignorant</hi> or <hi>Doubtful,</hi> how the Law of God ſtands as to ſuch a particular matter which Authority hath obliged him to; as neither having means to come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of it; or, if he had, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his condition not requiring that he ſhould ſo accurately inform himſelf about it: In ſuch a Caſe as this, I ſay, a man cannot <hi>formally</hi> be ſaid to be guilty of <hi>ſin</hi> in obeying his Lawful Superiours, though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which he obeys ſhould happen to contradict ſome Law of God. For the <hi>Law</hi> of God here, is as no <hi>Law</hi> to him, that is, it doth not <hi>oblige</hi> him, becauſe he neither knows it, nor is bound to know it. And <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And then further this is alſo to be remembred, that when we own that a man may be guilty of ſin as well in obeying his Superiours, when he only <hi>doubts</hi> of the Lawfulneſs of the Action commanded, as when he is <hi>Perſwaded</hi> that the Action is unlawful: I ſay, this we are to remember, that when ever this Caſe happens; the mans ſin doth not lye in his <hi>obeying</hi> his Superiours with a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience (which is commonly run away with): For the man would as certainly ſin, if in this Caſe he did the Action with a <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> that it was Lawful; as he doth in doing it with a <hi>Doubt,</hi> whether it be Lawful or no. But the ſin lies here: <hi>viz.</hi> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Action which Gods Law hath forbid; and which the man would have known to be an ill Action, if he had been ſo honeſt, and ſo careful in minding his Duty as he ſhould have been. It is his Acting contrary to a Law of God, that here makes the <hi>matter</hi> of the ſin; and it is his vitious criminal Ignorance of that Law which gives the <hi>Form</hi> to it. But as for the obeying his Superiours, whether with a <hi>Doubt</hi> or without one, that is no part or ingredient of the ſin at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We add this further, That whatever Power
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:262"/> or Right we give to our Superiours, for the over-ruling a <hi>Private Doubt;</hi> It is not to be extended ſo far as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſtroy the <hi>Truth;</hi> or to ſuperſede the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> I have before laid down in order to the directing a mans proceeding in the Caſe of a <hi>Double Doubt.</hi> For this Caſe of <hi>obeying the Commands of our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours</hi> when we doubt of the Lawfulneſs of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Double Doubt</hi> as properly as any other, thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> are here to take place as much as in any other inſtance.</p>
                        <p>And therefore where ever a mans <hi>Doubts</hi> are in this Caſe very <hi>unequal:</hi> That is to ſay, he apprehends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in much greater <hi>danger</hi> of ſinning if he <hi>obey</hi> his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours in this particular inſtance, than if he <hi>obey</hi> them not; as having abundantly more Reaſon to believe that their Commands are Unlawful, than that they are Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: In that Caſe we cannot ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e is obliged to <hi>obey,</hi> but ſhould rather <hi>diſobey,</hi> ſuppoſing all other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations be equal. For no man is bound to <hi>obey</hi> his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours any farther than they command <hi>Lawful</hi> things. And therefore if it be two to one more <hi>Probable</hi> that their Command is <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> than that it is <hi>Lawful,</hi> it is likewiſe more <hi>Probable</hi> that a man in this Inſtance is not to <hi>obey</hi> them. And <hi>a greater Probability, caeteris paribus, is always to be choſen before a leſs,</hi> according to our <hi>Firſt</hi> Rule</p>
                        <p>But, then though the Authority of our Superiours alone will not in this Caſe be of force enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the Ballance which is ſo far inclined the other way, and to turn it on its own ſide: Yet there may be, and very uſually are, ſuch other Arguments drawn from the Conſideration of the <hi>greater ſin,</hi> and the more <hi>dreadful Conſequences,</hi> of <hi>diſobeying</hi> in this inſtance, than of <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> As will to any reaſonable man out-weigh all the <hi>Probabilities</hi> on the other ſide (ſo long as they are not ſo great as to create a perſwaſion) and make it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:263"/> reaſonable for the man rather to do the Action; how ſtrong ſoever his Doubts be of the unlawfulneſs of it (ſo long as they are but <hi>Doubts);</hi> than to <hi>omit</hi> it after Lawful Authority hath enjoyned it.</p>
                        <p>But however this happen: It is always to be born in mind, as before, that if it ſhould prove that our Superiours do command nothing in the particular Inſtances, but what they <hi>Lawfully</hi> may do: It will not juſtifie any mans <hi>diſobedience,</hi> to ſay, that he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it was more <hi>dangerous</hi> or more <hi>ſinful</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> them, than to <hi>diſobey</hi> them: For our <hi>Miſtakes</hi> and <hi>falſe Reaſonings,</hi> will not take off from the Obligation that is upon us to obey our Lawful Superiours in their Lawful Commands; unleſs, as I have often ſaid, we can ſatisfie our ſelves, that in thoſe Inſtances we neither were bound, nor had ſufficient means to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand better.</p>
                        <p>And now having thus cleared our way, by removing from our <hi>Queſtion</hi> thoſe things that are <hi>Foreign</hi> to it, and which indeed, by being uſually blended with it, have made it more Intricate than otherwiſe it would be; we are pretty well prepared to propoſe our Point.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Sixth</hi> place then. Excluding (as we have done) out of our Caſe all thoſe Things and Circumſtances we have been ſpeaking of, with none of which we have here to do; the plain Queſtion before us is this.</p>
                        <p>Whether in the Caſe of a pure <hi>Doubt</hi> about the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> or <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs</hi> of an Action, where the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities</hi> are on both ſides pretty <hi>equal</hi> and where likewiſe the Man concerned, hath done all that he was obliged to do for the ſatisfying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Whether, I ſay, in this Caſe the Command of a Lawful Superiour ought not ſo far to over-ballance the <hi>Doubt,</hi> as not only to make it reaſonable for the Man to do that of which he doubteth; but alſo to oblige him ſo to do?</p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52190:263"/>
                        <p>We hold the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of this Queſtion, and I now come to give the Reaſons why we ſo hold, which is the Second thing to be done under this Head.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Our Propoſition is this, That if Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity do Command us to do a thing which as on the one hand we cannot ſay it is <hi>Lawful;</hi> ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, we cannot ſay it is <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful;</hi> but our Judgment remains ſuſpended, as having equal, or near equal Arguments on both ſides: In ſuch a Caſe as this, though if we were left to our own Choice, we ſhould generally forbear the Action for the Reaſons I before gave; yet being Commanded by our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, who by the Law of God have Authority over us; it is not only <hi>reaſonable,</hi> but our <hi>Duty</hi> to do it.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, even in point of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,</hi> though there was no other conſideration; one would think that a Subject owes as much deference to the Judgment and Diſcretion of his Superiours as this comes to.</p>
                        <p>So much influence as this, even a <hi>Confeſſor</hi> or a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friend</hi> hath over our Conſciences. In a Caſe where we are altogether uncertain on both ſides, we uſually ſo far ſubmit our ſelves to them, as to be ſwayed and over-ruled by what they adviſe; and that oftentimes not ſo much upon Conſideration of the weight and force of their Reaſons, as meerly upon this account, that we take them to be abler to guide us in theſe Affairs than we our ſelves are, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving better conſidered them, and ſeeing farther into them than we do.</p>
                        <p>I dare ſay there are few of thoſe we are now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing with, if a Doubt ſhould happen to ariſe in their Conſcience about the Lawfulneſs of any Practice in their <hi>Trade,</hi> or their other civil Concernments, and they ſhould upon this apply to ſome Friend of theirs,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:264"/> of whoſe <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> they have a good Opinion, and put their Caſe to him: But would (if the <hi>Doubt</hi> was ſo <hi>equal</hi> on both ſides as in our Caſe we ſuppoſe it) without any great difficulty be concluded and determined by the Judgment of the man they thus apply to; eſpecially if that Judgment be ſeconded by the ſuffrage of ſome other Learned Pious men, whom they have thought fit upon this occaſion to conſult likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>If now the Opinions of one or two <hi>Private</hi> men be of ſo much weight as to over-rule a <hi>Doubt</hi> about the Lawfulneſs of an Action, when the Reaſons on both ſides are equal: Is it not very hard if the joynt Reſolution and Determination of our <hi>Publick Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> whoſe Office and Buſineſs it is to Conſult and Command for the Beſt, ſhould not in ſuch a Caſe have the ſame Influence upon the Minds of their own <hi>Subjects?</hi> Or would it not argue much <hi>Self-conceit</hi> and <hi>Arrogance,</hi> and a very <hi>mean Opinion</hi> of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and a great <hi>Contempt</hi> of their Authority, to refuſe that reſpect to them which we give to every <hi>private</hi> Man almoſt that we think wiſer than our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> I deſire that may be taken notice of, which the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and in particular our Excellent Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> have urged in this affair, <hi>viz.</hi> It is a known Rule in Law, <hi>That in all diſputed Caſes, he that is in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the thing contended for, hath the advantage of the other that contends with him, ſuppoſing all other things be equal.</hi> In controverted Matters, the Right is always preſumed to be on the ſide of the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> unleſs there be a good Reaſon ſhewn to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                        <p>Thus for Inſtance, If I be in poſſeſſion of an <hi>Eſtate</hi> which another man makes a claim to: And it is equally
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52190:264"/> doubtful whether that <hi>Eſtate</hi> belongs to him or me, yet ſo long as I have the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of it, I have a good Title to it by the Laws of God and Man; nor can I without injuſtice be diſpoſſeſſed of it, till my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary hath made it appear that he hath a better Title to it than I.</p>
                        <p>Let us now apply this Rule to our preſent Caſe. Here is a Conteſt or Diſpute between the <hi>Superiour</hi> and the <hi>Subject,</hi> about a matter of <hi>Right</hi> as to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Action. The <hi>Superiour</hi> ſaith it is his <hi>Right</hi> to Command his Subject in this Inſtance, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth Command him. The <hi>Subject</hi> ſaith that he doubts whether his Superiour hath <hi>Right</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him in this Inſtance, becauſe he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Command be not againſt the Law of God.</p>
                        <p>But in the mean time the Superiour is in actual poſſeſſion of the Power and Authority to Command, though it be uncertain and doubtful whether as to this Inſtance he do not exceed the juſt Limits of his Power.</p>
                        <p>Why, certainly by the former Rule, ſo long as the Caſe is thus doubtful, the Subject muſt yield; and at no hand by his diſobedience <hi>diſpoſſeſs</hi> his Superiour of that Authority he is poſſeſſed of, till he be convinced in his own Conſcience that he hath greater reaſon to <hi>diſobey</hi> in this Inſtance than to <hi>obey;</hi> which in our Caſe it is impoſſible he ſhould have, becauſe we here ſuppoſe that the Reaſons on both ſides are equal.</p>
                        <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If this Argument appear too ſubtile; let the Queſtion before us be decided by the <hi>Common Rule, viz.</hi> That in all <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſide is to be choſen.</p>
                        <p>Now putting the Point upon this Iſſue, I ask which is <hi>ſafeſt,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Conſcience,</hi> for a man to <hi>obey</hi> his Superiours in ſuch a <hi>purely Doubtful</hi> Caſe as we here
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52190:265"/> ſpeak of: Or to <hi>diſobey</hi> them? I think this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſoon be anſwered by any Man that will attend to what I am going to repreſent, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a <hi>Plain</hi> Law of God, and acknowledged by us to be ſo, that <hi>Commands</hi> us to <hi>obey</hi> our Superiours in all <hi>Lawful</hi> things: But as to the particular Caſe about which we are now ſuppoſed to <hi>Doubt,</hi> it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain</hi> and <hi>Queſtionable</hi> to us, (even after our beſt endeavours to ſatisfie our ſelves) whether there be any Law of God which <hi>forbiddeth</hi> that thing which our Superiours have enjoyned us.</p>
                        <p>This now being ſo, we thus argue. If it ſhould prove that our Superiours do in this Inſtance command an <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> thing; yet the <hi>hazard</hi> we run in <hi>obeying</hi> them is very ſmall and inconſiderable, in compariſon with <hi>that</hi> we run in <hi>diſobeying</hi> them, ſuppoſing it ſhould indeed prove that they command nothing but what is <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> and conducing to the <hi>Publick Good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For by doing the former, by <hi>obeying</hi> our Superiours, the only <hi>hazard</hi> we run, is of tranſgreſſing ſome <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi> Law of God; ſome Law which doth no way <hi>appear</hi> to us; all that we can pronounce after our beſt enquiry being no more than this, that it may be there is ſuch a Law, and it may be there is not: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may reaſonably preſume that if there ſhould indeed be ſuch a Law of God; it is either not of ſuch conſequence that we in our Circumſtances were bound to <hi>know</hi> it, or if it was, that we had no ſufficient <hi>means</hi> to cometo the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of it: in each of which Caſes, as I ſaid, a Mans <hi>Ignorance</hi> doth excuſe the violation of the Law.</p>
                        <p>But now, on the other ſide, if in ſuch an Inſtance as this we <hi>diſobey</hi> Authority when it hath <hi>peremptorly</hi> laid its Commands upon us; we venture upon a much greater <hi>danger.</hi> For in that Caſe we run the <hi>hazard</hi> of tranſgreſſing a <hi>Plain</hi> Law of God; a Law of which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52190:265"/> no man can or ought to be ſuppoſed Ignorant; and withal, a Law it is of ſuch <hi>Importance</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> to Mankind, that we may truly ſay, the very <hi>being,</hi> as well as the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of all Societies depend upon it.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſing now this to be a true Account of the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard</hi> we run in Acting on one ſide or the other in our preſent Queſtion, I leave it to any indifferent perſon to judge, whether it be not much ſafer in ſuch Circumſtances as we here ſpeak of to <hi>obey</hi> our Lawful Superiours with a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience, than to <hi>diſobey</hi> them with a <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If there yet remain any diſpute in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let, if you pleaſe, our Saviour's <hi>Rule</hi> determine it, <hi>As ye would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do ye unto them.</hi> We deſire no more favour for our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, than this eternal Law of <hi>Equity</hi> will oblige us to.</p>
                        <p>If a man will but be ſo impartial, as to paſs the ſame Judgment in the Cauſe of Authority when he is a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> as he doth in his own Cauſe when he is a <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> we believe there would be preſently an end of this Controverſie.</p>
                        <p>For let men talk as gravely as they pleaſe about the <hi>danger</hi> of obeying the <hi>Publick</hi> Laws with a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience: Yet I dare appeal to themſelves, whether they would not think it very unreaſonable for any Domeſtick of theirs, over whom they have Lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to live in Contradiction to the <hi>Private</hi> Rules and Orders of their Family, upon a pretence of <hi>doubting</hi> whether thoſe Orders were Lawful or no.</p>
                        <p>If a <hi>Parent,</hi> for Inſtance, ſhould command his <hi>Son</hi> to ſit <hi>uncovered</hi> before him; He would not take it for a good Anſwer from the young man, to ſay, Sir, I am doubtful whether it be not unlawful to uſe any ſuch Ceremonies to Men, and therefore I pray excuſe me, if I do not pay you that Reſpect you require.</p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52190:266"/>
                        <p>If a <hi>Maſter</hi> ſhould order his <hi>Servant</hi> to provide Dinner for him on the Lords Day; and he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; I would do it with all my heart, but that I am in <hi>doubt</hi> whether it be not forbidden by Gods Word to do any Work on the Sabbath. I am not indeed <hi>perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> that it is forbidden, but in the mean time I am not ſatisfied that it is Lawful, and therefore till I be reſolved in this Point, I pray Sir, be pleaſed to Pardon me.</p>
                        <p>Would now a <hi>Parent</hi> or a <hi>Maſter</hi> think theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers Reaſonable? would he take them in ſuch good part as to think his <hi>Son</hi> or his <hi>Servant</hi> had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they were bound to do in thus refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to obey his Commands? No, I dare ſay he would not, but on the contrary would tell them; you are my <hi>Son</hi> or my <hi>Servant,</hi> and you muſt leave it to me to judge what is fit for <hi>me</hi> to command and for <hi>you</hi> to do. I will take care to command you nothing but what is lawful and juſtifiable: But in the mean time, you muſt not think by your fooliſh <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> (ſo long as you confeſs you <hi>know</hi> nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in what I bid you do) to control my Orders and Commands, that I think neither becomes <hi>you</hi> to do, nor <hi>me</hi> to ſuffer.</p>
                        <p>I dare ſay moſt men would judge this a very fitting and juſt Reply in ſuch a Caſe. And if ſo, it is a ſtrong Argument, that we are all naturally apt to think that in purely <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, our Superiour is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed notwithſtanding our <hi>Doubt,</hi> and that if in any Caſe we think otherwiſe, it is where our own <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> are concerned, and where conſequently we may be juſtly preſumed unequal Judges, as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in favour of our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let me add this one Conſideration more, and I have done. If in meerly <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, our Superiours have not a Power of Determining us;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52190:266"/> what will their <hi>Authority</hi> ſignifie? If it be not of weight enough when the Scales hang even to turn the Ballance; it is truly the lighteſt thing in the World. Indeed it is worth nothing; and there will not be left Power enough in thoſe that are to govern us, for the ſecuring in any tolerable degree the Peace and Happineſs of the Society they are to govern.</p>
                        <p>For I pray conſider, What can there be ſo wiſely Commanded, or Provided for, either in a <hi>Family,</hi> in a <hi>City,</hi> or in a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but may be liable to exception, and become a matter of <hi>Doubt</hi> to ſome Perſon or other?</p>
                        <p>There is nothing in the whole compaſs of <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> things (and ſuch chiefly are the Matters of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Laws) but ſome Perſon or other will be found to <hi>doubt</hi> whether it be <hi>fit</hi> or <hi>lawful.</hi> And if ſuch a <hi>Doubt</hi> be a juſt Reaſon to deny Obedience to the Law or the Command, in what a condition are all <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and <hi>Corporations,</hi> and <hi>Societies</hi> in the World? What will be the Conſequence of ſuch a Principle? Why certainly nothing but perpetual Jars, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, and Confuſions.</p>
                        <p>For Inſtance, If whenever a Prince declares War againſt his Enemies, it ſhould be ſuppoſed Lawful for any Subject to withdraw his Aſſiſtance from his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign in Caſe he <hi>doubts</hi> whether that War be a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful War or no; in what a ſad caſe would that Prince or that Kingdom be, that is to be ſupported and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected upon theſe Terms? Every man is hereby made a Judge of the Merits of a <hi>War;</hi> and though he be never ſo Ignorant, never ſo Unexperienced, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Ignorant, never ſo Unexperienced, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unable to make a Judgment of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Affairs of the Kingdom; yet if ſome Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or uncertain Stories have reached his Ears, that make him doubt whether this War was lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun or no: Why he is upon this Principle warranted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52190:267"/> to deny not only his <hi>Perſonal</hi> Service, but his <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions</hi> towards the Charge of that War. But theſe <hi>Conſequences</hi> are <hi>intolerable;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> from whence they flow, muſt needs be thought <hi>intolerable</hi> alſo.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Having thus given the reaſons of our Aſſertion, I come now in the <hi>Third</hi> place to anſwer the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are brought on the other ſide.</p>
                        <p>All the Arguments I have met with againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we have been eſtabliſhing, may be reduced to <hi>Three;</hi> and of thoſe three, the <hi>Firſt</hi> I have prevented by my ſtating the Queſtion; the <hi>Second</hi> I have already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in my Proofs of our Aſſertion: ſo that the <hi>Third</hi> only remains to be ſpoken to. However I will name the <hi>two firſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Argument is drawn from the miſchievous Conſequences of our Doctrine. For, ſay they, If a man ſhould think himſelf obliged in every doubtful Caſe to be determined by the Command of his Superiours, it would be the ready way to involve him often times in moſt grievous ſins. As for inſtance, if a man ſhould ſo <hi>halt between two opinions,</hi> as to doubt whether <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi> was the true God, as the <hi>Iſralites</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did; and at the ſame time (as it then happened among them) the Chief Ruler ſhould command that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> ſhould be worſhipped: Why now in this Caſe (ſay they) according to your way of <hi>reſolving Doubts,</hi> the man muſt be obliged to worſhip an <hi>Idol,</hi> and to renounce the true God.</p>
                        <p>This is the Argument. But it is no Argument againſt us: Becauſe in the ſtating of our Queſtion, we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all ſuch <hi>Doubts</hi> out of it, as do proceed from a mans <hi>Groſs</hi> and <hi>Criminal</hi> Ignorance of his Duty (as it is Apparent and Notorious that the <hi>Doubt</hi> in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance doth). On the contrary, we are as forward to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52190:267"/> acknowledge as they, that if any man do an Action that is plainly contradictory to the Laws of God, it is not his <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> and much leſs his <hi>Doubtfulneſs,</hi> that will excuſe him, though he do it in obedience to his Governours. So that though this Argument would fall heavy enough upon thoſe that plead for an <hi>Abſolute Blind</hi> Obedience to Authority in all things <hi>indiſcriminately,</hi> (which no man of the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth): Yet it doth not at all touch us, who only aſſert, That where we doubt <hi>equally,</hi> whether an Action be Lawful or no, and have uſed our beſt endeavours to ſatisfie our ſelves how the Law of God ſtands as to that matter, there the Command of our Superiours is to over-rule our <hi>Doubt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But further, to ſhew what little force there is in this Argument, which indeed hath made a great deal of noiſe; we will try whether it will not make as much againſt our Adverſaries, if they will give <hi>us</hi> leave to put the Caſe, as it ſeems to make againſt us, when <hi>they</hi> put the Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Let us ſuppoſe therefore, as before, that an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was very <hi>Doubtful</hi> whether <hi>Jehovah</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi> was the true God: And let us ſuppoſe likewiſe (as we reaſonably may) that the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made a Law, that all the <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> ſhould be demoliſhed, and that <hi>Jehovah</hi> only ſhould be worſhipped. What advice now would they give to the <hi>doubting</hi> Man in this Caſe? Will they ſay that he muſt comply with the Kings Laws, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>Jehovah</hi> only, while yet he is doubtful in his own mind whether <hi>Baal</hi> be not the true God? Why this is againſt their own Principle, and gives away the Cauſe to us. But, will they then ſay, that while this <hi>Doubt</hi> remains, the Man muſt not <hi>obey</hi> Authority in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Jehovah</hi> only; but he muſt either worſhip <hi>Baal</hi> and not <hi>Jehovah;</hi> or both <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Jehovah</hi> together;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52190:268"/> Why, this is indeed agreeable to their Principle; but then I appeal to my Reader, whether according to their way of <hi>reſolving</hi> of <hi>Doubts,</hi> a man is not as neceſſarily ingaged in <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and other grievous ſins, as he is by our way.</p>
                        <p>So that you ſee this Argument concludes as ſtrongly againſt them, as againſt us. But in Truth it concludes nothing either one way or other, but is wholly For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the Queſtion, as I ſhewed in my ſtating of it, whither I refer the Reader.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Argument is drawn from the Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God himſelf hath put to the Obedience we are to pay to our Governours, and it may be formed thus. God hath not commanded us to obey our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and in <hi>all</hi> things; but only in all ſuch things as are not contrary to <hi>his Law:</hi> So that where ever we are <hi>uncertain</hi> whether the Commands of our Superiour be <hi>Lawful</hi> or no, we muſt at the ſame time be as much <hi>uncertain</hi> whether we be bound to <hi>obey:</hi> And if ſo, how can you ſay that it is any more our Duty to <hi>obey</hi> them, than to <hi>diſobey</hi> them in a <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Caſe?</p>
                        <p>To this we anſwer, That though we acknowledge that no Man is bound to obey his Superiours any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they command <hi>Lawful</hi> things: Yet when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it happens that they command ſuch things as we <hi>equally</hi> doubt whether they be <hi>Lawful</hi> or no; there are ſo many weighty Reaſons to be given, why a man ſhould <hi>obey</hi> rather than <hi>diſobey</hi> in that Caſe, as will perſwade any Wiſe and Good Man to think it his Duty to <hi>obey.</hi> And for thoſe Reaſons I refer my Reader to the <hi>Five</hi> Particulars I before inſiſted on.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and indeed the Principal Argument, is drawn from the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>14th</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the laſt verſe, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if</hi>
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52190:268"/> 
                           <hi>he eat, beauſe he eateth not of Faith; and whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin.</hi> From whence they thus Argue, If it was a ſin in thoſe Chriſtians that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of to eat any Food, though in it ſelf <hi>Lawful</hi> to be eaten, ſo long as they <hi>Doubted</hi> whether it was <hi>Lawful</hi> or no: Then, by parity of Reaſon, it muſt be a ſin to do any other Action, ſo long as we have a Doubt in our minds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lawfulneſs of it; and if ſo, it is not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates commanding that Action, that will make it ceaſe to be a ſin in us to do it.</p>
                        <p>This is the great Argument that is brought againſt our Point, and I ſhall give it a full and a juſt diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Becauſe, in truth, if we come clearly off from this Text of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> not only all that is ſaid againſt <hi>Obeying Authority</hi> with a <hi>Doubting Conſcience</hi> will fall to the ground: But likewiſe moſt of the difficulties which entangle and perplex the Caſe of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience</hi> in other matters, will be in a great meaſure removed.</p>
                        <p>But before I enter upon a particular diſcuſſion of this Text, with reference to our preſent Controverſie, it will be needful to premiſe ſome general Account of it, for the ſake of ordinary Readers, that ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding before hand the <hi>Caſe</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks to, and the meaning of the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> he here uſeth, they may be the better able to go along with us.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, therefore, I ſhall give an Account of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe in this Chapter. II. Of what is meant by <hi>Doubting</hi> in this Text. III. What is meant by <hi>eating not of Faith.</hi> IV. What is meant by being <hi>Damned</hi> or <hi>Condemned</hi> for ſo doing.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, As to the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe in this <hi>Chapter;</hi> it is undoubtedly the Caſe of thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians that were not ſo fully inſtructed in their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> but that they ſtill believed all the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> concerning the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52190:269"/> of <hi>Days,</hi> and the <hi>Difference</hi> of <hi>Meats,</hi> to be ſtill in force, and to oblige their Conſcience: Or at leaſt they mightily doubted whether they did or not. So that whereas other Chriſtians, who were better inſtructed, made no ſcruple of eating any kind of Food, though forbidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Theſe men had great Reaſon to forbear ſuch kind of Meats, becauſe they were <hi>Perſwaded,</hi> or at leaſt it appeared more <hi>probable</hi> to them, than otherwiſe, that they were bound ſo to do.</p>
                        <p>That this was the Caſe of thoſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſtyles the <hi>weak Chriſtians,</hi> appears from ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this Chapter, nor I think is it much queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any. As for what is intimated in the ſecond Verſe, concerning their abſtaining from <hi>Fleſh</hi> altogether, and only eating <hi>Herbs;</hi> which would make one think that it was not purely their reſpect to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but ſome other thing, which made them thus to put a <hi>difference</hi> between Meats; becauſe by that Law, they were no more tyed from <hi>Fleſh</hi> (excepting only <hi>Swines-Fleſh</hi> and a few other ſorts) than they were from <hi>Herbs:</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath well obviated this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, in the Account he gives of the Caſe of thoſe Chriſtians. <q>There were (ſaith he) ſeveral of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who taking themſelves to be obliged in Conſcience by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> even after their Chriſtianity, did ſtill retain the Obſervation of Meats, not daring wholly to throw off the Yoak of the Law: Theſe now, leſt they ſhould be found out, and reproached by the other Chriſtians for thus abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Swines-Fleſh,</hi> and the like, upon account of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> choſe to eat no <hi>Fleſh</hi> at all, but to feed altogether upon <hi>Herbs;</hi> that ſo this way of living of theirs, might paſs rather for a kind of <hi>Faſt</hi> or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> than for a <hi>Legal Obſervance.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52190:269"/>
                        <p>But if any one be not ſatisfied with this Account of that Buſineſs; but will further contend, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here doth not only ſpeak to the Caſe of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who were zealous for <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: But alſo takes in the Caſe of ſome <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians at that time, who (upon a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Principle they might have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) were <hi>Averſe</hi> to the eating any kind of <hi>Fleſh;</hi> as thinking all ſuch Food to be <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean:</hi> They may, notwithſtanding what I have ſaid, enjoy their own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. For it is indifferent to our Controverſie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Perſons whoſe Caſe is here ſpoken to, were <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Only thus much appears plainly, that the moſt of them were <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, who, together with their <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> had a Conſcientious regard to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] the very word in the Text.</p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52190:270"/>
                        <p>Now conſidering the Apoſtles Argument in this Chapter is the Caſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, who were divided in their Perſwaſions about the <hi>Legal</hi> Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome making a difference between <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi> Meats, and ſuch like things; and others ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king none: It ſeems every whit as proper and natural, and more ſuitable to the ſcope of the Place, to take the Word in this Senſe in this place, rather than in that other, according to which it is uſually tranſlated. So that the Text is thus to be rendered, <hi>He that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a difference</hi> between clean and unclean Meats; <hi>If he do eat</hi> any thing which he judgeth to be unclean, <hi>he is damned or condemned</hi> for ſo doing, <hi>becauſe he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſo probable is this rendring, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlators took care to put it in the Margin of our Bibles, as may be ſeen by every one. Nor doth it want good Authority, for the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgar Latine</hi> thus tranſlates the place, and not only ſo, but <hi>Eraſmus Hentenius,</hi> and generally all the Latine Expoſitors, if we may believe <hi>Eſtius,</hi> who yet himſelf interprets it the Common way.</p>
                        <p>Indeed I doubt not but this is the true Verſion of this Word in this Text, However I do not ſo much ſtand upon it, as to preclude any man from the liberty of taking the other if he likes it better. For though this way of rendering doth better ſerve our Purpoſe, (as quite putting an end to the Controverſie): Yet our Cauſe doth not ſo abſolutely depend upon it, but that we may very well allow of the common Tranſlation; as will appear hereafter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for the Word <hi>Faith,</hi> which is here uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; let it be taken notice of, that when in the verſe before the Text, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>having Faith;</hi> and in the Text, of <hi>eating</hi> without <hi>Faith,</hi> or not of <hi>Faith;</hi> and that, <hi>whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin;</hi> We are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52190:270"/> not to take <hi>Faith</hi> here in the large ſenſe, as it ſignifies a Belief in Jeſus Chriſt, or an Aſſent to Gods Revelations, particularly thoſe of the Goſpel; which is the uſual No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Faith</hi> in the New Teſtament: But only for a mans <hi>Aſſent</hi> to the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Action</hi> that he takes in hand.</p>
                        <p>So that to <hi>have Faith</hi> about an Action, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that that Action may be Lawfully done in the preſent Circumſtances, or at leaſt not to be Conſcious of any Reaſon that ſhould make it unlawful. And, on the other ſide, to do an Action <hi>without Faith,</hi> or <hi>not of Faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle here expreſſeth it, is to do an Action of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of which we are no way ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but, on the contrary, think we have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that it is an unlawful Action.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he that doubteth</hi> or <hi>differenceth, is damned</hi> or condemned, <hi>if he eat;</hi> we are to take notice, that that expreſſion is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of his eating in the other World, (which is that which in common ſpeech we call <hi>Damnation):</hi> But only of the <hi>guilt</hi> of his eating as to his own <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Indeed there is no colour why our Tranſlators ſhould here uſe the Word [Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned], ſince [Condemned] is the natural Word, whether we conſider the Propriety of the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh Language.:</hi> So that this is the meaning of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>He that doubteth</hi> (with ſuch a Doubt as is here ſpoken of) <hi>and yet eateth;</hi> ſuch a Man is <hi>condemned</hi> for ſo doing. Condemned, how? why <hi>condemned</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (as the Apoſtle had expreſſed it in the verſe before), <hi>condemned</hi> of his own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> becauſe without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, having free power over his own Actions, he doth that which he apprehends to be ſinful.</p>
                        <p>I dare ſay, the Reader will be ſatisfied of the Truth of our Interpretation, as to both the laſt named Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52190:271"/> if he will carefully read the foregoing verſe together with the Text (as indeed they do but both make one compleat Sentence) and judge of one by the other.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath for a good while been addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>ſtronger</hi> Chriſtians, in order to the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them ſo to uſe their Knowledge and their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty, that they might edifie the <hi>Weak</hi> Brethren among them, but in no ways give Scandal to any of them, and he thus concludes his Advice in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Haſt thou Faith? have it to thy ſelfe before God. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that condemneth not himſelf in that thing which he alloweth: But he that doubteth</hi> (or maketh a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) <hi>is condemned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith, and whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I dare appeal to any indifferent perſon, that hath read St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s foregoing Diſcourſe in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> whether the meaning of this whole Paſſage be not to this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                        <p>Art thou ſo well inſtructed in thy Religion, as to be perſwaded that the Goſpel hath taken away all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Meats, and that thou mayeſt Lawfully eat of any Food that is ſet before thee? why, it is very well for thee; but then, be content that thou art thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and do not upon every occaſion make ſuch an oſtentation of thy Faith in this matter, nor deſpiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have it not; as to lay a Snare before thy Weak and Un-inſtructed Brethren, who are of another perſwaſion, to ſin againſt their Conſcience, by Acting as thou doſt. It is ſufficient for thee that God ſeeth thy <hi>Faith,</hi> and that thou canſt juſtifie thy eating to thy own Conſcience. For I can aſſure thee, it is no ſmall Happineſs for a Man to be able to ſatisfie his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that Action which he takes in hand.</p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:52190:271"/>
                        <p>[This is undoubtedly the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>Happy is he that condemneth not himſelf in that thing which he approveth.</hi> That is, it is a great Comfort to a Man that his Conſcience doth not condemn him in that Action which he thinks fit to do. <hi>In ea re quam agendam ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius; In eo quod agendum elegit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſtius; En ce qu'il veut faire,</hi> ſaith the late excellent <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation. And it is juſt the ſame thing that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith in other words. <hi>Eph.</hi> I. 3, 21. <hi>My Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, if our own hearts</hi> (i. e. our Conſcience) <hi>condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But then, (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> goes on) as to thoſe that are ſo uninſtructed in the Nature of Chriſtianity, as ſtill to make a difference between clean and unclean Meats; as it infinitely concerns <hi>them</hi> to have a care what they do; ſo it concerns <hi>thee</hi> likewiſe to have a care how thou layeſt a ſtumbling block before them. For in what a Condition would any of them be, if being tempted by thy Inſolent Carriage, and Unreaſonable Example, he ſhould through <hi>Fear</hi> or baſe <hi>Compliance</hi> venture to eat ſuch things as he judgeth to be <hi>unclean?</hi> Why, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is both an ill and a miſerable man for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe he is <hi>condemned</hi> of his own <hi>Conſcience.</hi> For he eats not only without being convinced of the Lawfulneſs of his eating, but preſuming the contrary, and whatever is thus done againſt Conſcience, muſt needs be a ſin. This I take to be the true meaning of this whole Paſſage, for which, if need was, we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſeveral Authorities, particularly that of St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> who gives much the ſame account of it.</p>
                        <p>Having thus given an account of the Text as it lies in the Chapter, and with relation to the Buſineſs that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had there in hand. I now come to conſider it with reference to our preſent Controverſie with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and to take off the Argument they bring from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52190:272"/> it, againſt the Poſition we are now contending for.</p>
                        <p>Their Argument, as I ſaid, is this.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> here affirms, That whoſoever <hi>Doubteth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lawfulneſs of any particular <hi>Meat,</hi> and while that Doubt remaineth, eateth of that Meat, ſuch a man <hi>Sins,</hi> and is <hi>Condemned</hi> for ſo doing; becauſe he eateth not of <hi>Faith.</hi> If now it be ſo in this particular Caſe, it muſt be ſo in all other <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Caſe of <hi>Obeying Authority,</hi> where a Man <hi>Doubts</hi> of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of the thing enjoyned. That is to ſay. Whoſoever, in any Caſe whatſoever, doth an Action of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of which he <hi>Doubts;</hi> he <hi>ſins,</hi> and is <hi>Condemned</hi> for ſo doing, becauſe he acteth not of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the Argument fairly put, and I ſhall now endeavour as fairly to anſwer it.</p>
                        <p>And firſt of all, I ſay, This Argument proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a falſe Ground. For it ſuppoſeth St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Text to ſpeak to the Caſe of a <hi>purely Doubting Conſcience,</hi> (which is the Subject of our preſent Controverſie): Whereas it may be made to appear with good Evidence, that it is the Caſe of a <hi>reſolved Conſcience</hi> only, that he here Treats of. So that this Text is wholly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied by the Diſſenters, and makes nothing at all to the Buſineſs. For though there be indeed in this Text a very ſevere Cenſure of all thoſe that Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any kind of <hi>Perſwaſion;</hi> yet there is nothing here ſaid that toucheth a mans Acting <hi>Doubtingly,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one way or other.</p>
                        <p>That this is true, appears from the Account I have before given of the <hi>Subject matter</hi> of the Apoſtles Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in this Chapter; which is, the Caſe of thoſe Chriſtians who were not barely <hi>Doubtful</hi> and <hi>Waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in their own Minds, whether they might Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully eat of ſuch <hi>Meats</hi> as were then Diſputed: But
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52190:272"/> were <hi>Perſwaded</hi> they ought not; as believing that the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which had declared them <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> was ſtill in force; or elſe believing them to be <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean</hi> in themſelves.</p>
                        <p>That this was indeed the Caſe here diſcuſſed, ſeems very clear from the 2<hi>d</hi> and <hi>5th</hi> Verſes of this Chapter, where the Apoſtle <hi>ſtates it;</hi> and more particularly from the <hi>14th</hi> Verſe, where he gives a ſummary <hi>Reſolution</hi> of it; and in my Judgment the very ſame Reſolution that he doth in the <hi>Text. I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and am perſwaded that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf, but to him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi> So that it ſeems the Perſon whoſe Caſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to, was not <hi>uncertain</hi> or <hi>unreſolved</hi> whether the Meats under Deliberation were <hi>clean</hi> or <hi>unclean;</hi> but he was <hi>perſwaded</hi> they were unclean, he <hi>eſteemed</hi> them to be ſuch, and he muſt of neceſſity do ſo, ſo long as he believed the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be in force, as by all that appears in this Chapter he did believe.</p>
                        <p>But may ſome ſay, If this was the Caſe, why then doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſe the word <hi>Doubting</hi> in the Text? To <hi>Doubt</hi> of the unlawfulneſs of an Action, is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, than to be <hi>Perſwaded</hi> of the unlawfulneſs of it.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to this, I refer my Reader to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have before given of the Word [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] which may as properly be rendred, <hi>He that maketh a difference</hi> between Meats; as <hi>he that Doubteth</hi> about Meats. Now if this <hi>Verſion</hi> be admited, the ground of this Objection is quite taken away. And I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould not be admitted, ſince (as I ſaid) it is as natural as the other, and withal, it makes the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> Senſe to run more coherently with what he had ſaid before.</p>
                        <p>But further, Let if you pleaſe the common Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52190:273"/> be retained; let the Text be interpreted of one that <hi>Doubteth,</hi> and not of one that <hi>maketh a difference:</hi> Yet ſtill this will make nothing againſt what we have now ſaid. For it is undeniably plain, that what St. <hi>Paul</hi> here calls <hi>Doubting,</hi> is in our way of ſpeaking a degree of <hi>Perſwaſion.</hi> My meaning is this. The <hi>Doubting</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, is not that where a mans Judgment is ſuſpended, upon account of the equal Probabilities on both ſides of the Queſtion, which is the proper Notion of <hi>Doubting,</hi> and that which we are now concerned with: But he ſpeaks of a <hi>Doubt</hi> ſtrengthned with ſo many <hi>Probabilities,</hi> that it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but very little of a <hi>Perſwaſion;</hi> or, to ſpeak more properly, it was a real <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> though with ſome mixture of <hi>Doubtfulneſs</hi> in it. That is to ſay, the man had ſo ſtrong Convictions of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs</hi> of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one hand; and ſo little ſatisfaction about the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of it on the other; That if he was not fully perſwaded that it was a ſin to eat; yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by many degrees more probable to him that it was a ſin, than that it was not.</p>
                        <p>That this now was the Caſe, is evident beyond all exception, from the words that follow. <hi>He that doubteth</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Text) is condemned if he eat,</hi> that is, <hi>Condemned</hi> of his own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as I ſhewed before. Now how could that be, if the man was not in ſome degree <hi>perſwaded</hi> that his eating was unlawful? It is certain no man can be further <hi>Condemned</hi> of his own <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> for doing any Action, than he doth <hi>believe</hi> that Action to be <hi>forbidden</hi> by ſome Law of God. To ſay therefore, that a man is <hi>Condemned of his own Conſcience</hi> for <hi>eating,</hi> muſt of neceſſity imply, that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his <hi>eating</hi> to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> and if ſo, it is certain he doth more than ſimply <hi>douht</hi> whether it be lawful or no.</p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52190:273"/>
                        <p>Well, But doth not the Apoſtle ſay in this very Chapter, <hi>Let every one be fully perſwaded in his own mind?</hi> What is the meaning of That, but that every one ſhould aſſure himſelf that the Action he takes in hand is a lawful Action, or elſe he doth not act with a ſafe Conſcience? And is not that the very ſame thing that is here ſaid, <hi>He that doubteth is condemned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith,</hi> or with a full perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? There is therefore good Reaſon why we ſhould interpret this <hi>Text</hi> in the proper Senſe of <hi>Doubting,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf directing us ſo to do by this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                        <p>This is the moſt conſiderable Objection that can be made againſt our way of expounding this <hi>Text,</hi> and probably it was with a reſpect to that paſſage that ſo many Interpreters have Tranſlated it as they have done; but whether they had any juſt reaſon from thence ſo to do, is the Queſtion. Or rather I think it will be no Queſtion with any one who attends either to the deſign, or the words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                        <p>The paſſage is in the <hi>5th Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is giving an Account of the ſtate of the preſent Controverſie. <hi>One man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one day above another, another man eſteemeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day alike: Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</hi> So we render it, but how truly, I ſhall now examine.</p>
                        <p>It cannot well be conceived by the coming in of theſe words, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had any ſuch thing in his mind when he writ them, as we would now make them to expreſs. It was certainly none of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this place to oblige the contending Parties to get <hi>full perſwaſions</hi> in their ſeveral ways, and then all would be right, for there was too much of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52190:274"/> amongſt them. Neither was it his meaning here to tell them, that if in any Caſe they acted without a <hi>full perſuaſion</hi> of the Lawfulneſs of the Action, they ſinned againſt Conſcience; for beſides that this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe, it was nothing at all to his purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>But this was that which he deſign'd in this paſſage, to perſwade both the contending Parties quietly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit each other to enjoy their ſeveral <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Perſuaſions</hi> (in thoſe little matters, which did no way concern their Duty,) without <hi>Cenſuring</hi> or <hi>Judging</hi> one another.</p>
                        <p>This now is a meaning that perfectly ſuits with all the other good advice he gives them in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and this meaning he doth expreſs in as apt words as can be thought on. <hi>One man eſteemeth one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, another man eſteemeth every day alike. Let every man be filled with his own mind.</hi> Or, <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his own Perſwaſion.</hi> The Original words are [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52190:274"/> of the Apoſtle doth neceſſarily require this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>For, in truth, If this paſſage be rendred the common way, ſo as that it ſhall import that every Man, in every Caſe, is to be <hi>fully perſwaded in his own mind,</hi> I do not know how the Precept here given, can be ſuppoſed to be either <hi>Reaſonable</hi> or <hi>Poſſible.</hi> It is certainly no more in every Mans Power to be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> about all his <hi>Doubts;</hi> than it is to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>disbelieve</hi> what he pleaſes. When there appears Reaſon of <hi>Doubting,</hi> it is in vain to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Man not to <hi>Doubt.</hi> Nay, it is as much a Mans Duty to <hi>Doubt,</hi> and to keep his Judgment in ſuſpence, when the weight of <hi>Probability</hi> is on both ſides equal, as it is to <hi>believe</hi> or to <hi>disbelieve</hi> upon clear Evidence. Or rather in that Caſe a Man cannot chuſe but Doubt. He cannot <hi>reaſonably,</hi> nay, he cannot <hi>poſſibly</hi> do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                        <p>I think, by what hath been ſaid, it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> we are upon, <hi>[viz. He that Doubteth is condemned if he eat]</hi> hath nothing to do with a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience in our Senſe; but only with a <hi>reſolved</hi> one; and conſequently, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which is brought from hence againſt our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, is nothing at all to the purpoſe, becauſe it is grounded upon a falſe Expoſition of the Text.</p>
                        <p>But though this is (as I think) the true Anſwer to this Argument; and the Anſwer indeed which I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand upon: Yet there is another Anſwer given to it by the Caſuiſts; which, becauſe it is the Anſwer that our Learned Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> thought fit to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ought not to paſs it by without mention, nor, if I can, without ſome improvement.</p>
                        <p>I muſt confeſs, if we do admit this Anſwer, the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> of a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience will be ſet higher than I do in this Diſcourſe ſuppoſe it:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52190:275"/> But however, it may be a good Anſwer to the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; becauſe it unties the difficulty upon their own Principles: The Anſwer is this.</p>
                        <p>2. In the <hi>Second</hi> place, Allowing that the Man whoſe Caſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to in this Text, was really a <hi>Doubting</hi> Perſon, and not one that was <hi>Perſwaded</hi> (as we have hitherto ſuppoſed): Yet it doth by no means follow, that, becauſe this Man was guilty of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Condemned</hi> for <hi>eating</hi> thoſe Meats, of the Lawfulneſs of which he <hi>Doubted:</hi> Therefore a Man that <hi>Obeys</hi> Authority in an Inſtance where he <hi>Doubts</hi> of the Lawfulneſs of the Command; that ſuch a Man <hi>Sins</hi> and is <hi>Condemned</hi> for ſo doing. This, I ſay, doth not at all follow.</p>
                        <p>For there is a vaſt Diſparity in the Caſes; and to argue from one to the other, is to argue from a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> to an <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> or from <hi>one</hi> Particular to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> without reſpect to the different Circumſtances of each Caſe; which is againſt all the Rules of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, [He that Doubteth is Damned if he <hi>Act]</hi> there had been ſome pretence for making his Sentence an <hi>univerſal</hi> Propoſition, ſo as to extend to all <hi>Doubting</hi> Men in all Caſes: But now only ſaying, [He that Doubteth is Damned if he <hi>eat]</hi> it ſhews that he only ſpoke to the <hi>Particular</hi> Caſe that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and that other Caſes are no farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in his Propoſition, than as they do agree in <hi>Circumſtances</hi> with the Caſe he there ſpeaks to.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Caſe</hi> the Apoſtle there treats of, and <hi>That</hi> which we are now concerned about, are ſo far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way agreeing in the main <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> by which a Man is to meaſure the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or the <hi>Badneſs</hi> of an Action, that there cannot be two <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes put, that are more <hi>different,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:52190:275"/>
                        <p>If St. <hi>Paul</hi> do at all here ſpeak to the Caſe of a <hi>Doubting</hi> Man; he ſpeaks of one that Acted <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> in a matter where it was in his own Power to Act without a <hi>Doubt:</hi> That is, He was in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that he knew he might certainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin refuſe to eat thoſe Meats concerning which he doubted; for there was no colour of obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to eat them: But yet in this Caſe, where he was perfectly at Liberty to let alone; for the ſerving ſome evil unwarrantable ends, he would not chuſe that ſide which was <hi>ſafe,</hi> and where he need fear no ſin, which was to <hi>forbear;</hi> but would chuſe that ſide that was <hi>Doubtful;</hi> that is, would run a needleſs hazard of tranſgreſſing ſome Law of God. It is of ſuch a Man, and in ſuch a Caſe as this, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, when he ſaith, <hi>He that Doubteth is condemned if he eat:</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing indeed that his words are at all to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Senſe.</p>
                        <p>But now becauſe it is thus in this Caſe (and in all ſuch like, if you pleaſe): Doth it therefore follow from theſe words, that a Man that is in other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; that is not at Liberty to chuſe his own way; as not being at his own diſpoſal, but under the Direction and Government of Authority: That this man <hi>ſins</hi> and is <hi>condemned</hi> if he obey the Orders of his Superiours, when he is Doubtful of the Lawfulneſs of the thing in which he expreſſeth his Obedience? No, by no means. For this Caſe hath a quite different Conſideration.</p>
                        <p>In the former Caſe there was only <hi>danger</hi> on <hi>one ſide,</hi> and that was in <hi>Acting,</hi> and the Man might <hi>forbear</hi> if he pleaſed, and that without any <hi>danger:</hi> But in the other Caſe there is <hi>danger</hi> on <hi>both</hi> ſides, and the man runs at leaſt as great a <hi>hazard</hi> in <hi>forbearing</hi> the Action, (nay, we ſay, a much greater,) as if he ſhould do it.</p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:52190:276"/>
                        <p>So that undeniably (unleſs we will make one Rule to ſerve for all Caſes, though never ſo different, which is the abſurdeſt thing in the World): For any thing that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath here ſaid to the contrary; this latter man <hi>may</hi> not only without ſin do the thing he doubts of; but is <hi>bound</hi> to do it. Whereas, if the other man ſpoken of in the Text, ſhould do the Action he <hi>doubts</hi> of, it might be a ſin in him.</p>
                        <p>But further, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant not to extend his Propoſition to all <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, but only to ſuch Caſes as he here treats of; is pretty evident from the Reaſon that he gives, why he that <hi>eateth</hi> Doubtingly <hi>ſins</hi> in ſo doing; <hi>viz. Becauſe he eateth not of Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He doth not ſay, <hi>He that Doubteth is Condemned if he eat, becauſe he eateth</hi> with a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience. If he had ſaid ſo, I grant the Reaſon of his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition would have reached all <hi>Doubting</hi> men in all <hi>Caſes;</hi> but this is that which he ſaith, <hi>He that Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is condemned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that if there be any <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes wherein a Man may <hi>Act</hi> with <hi>Faith</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>Doubt:</hi> I hope it will be allowed, that thoſe Caſes are excepted out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Propoſition.</p>
                        <p>Now, that there are ſuch Caſes; and that our Caſe of <hi>Obeying Authority</hi> is one of them, I thus prove.</p>
                        <p>Whoſoever ſo Acts, as that he is ſatisfied in his own mind, that what he doth is according to his Duty in the preſent Circumſtances: Such a Man Acts with <hi>Faith</hi> in reference to that Action. This is evident from the very Notion of <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is here ſpoken of, of which I have before given an Account.</p>
                        <p>But now it is very poſſible, that a Man may have a <hi>Doubt</hi> concerning the Lawfulneſs of an Action, and yet be in ſuch Circumſtances, as that he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52190:276"/> that is very <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to his <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> nay, (as the Caſe may be) that he is really <hi>bound</hi> to do that Action concerning which he thus <hi>Doubts,</hi> rather than not to do it: Becauſe the not doing that Action, all things conſidered, appears to him more <hi>dangerous,</hi> or attended with worſe <hi>Conſequences.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This now being granted, it undeniably follows: That wherever a man lights into theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he is not a <hi>Sinner,</hi> even according to the ſtricteſt Senſe of theſe words, though he Act with ſome kind of Doubt, becauſe he Acts in <hi>Faith;</hi> That is, he is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved</hi> in his own Conſcience, that thus it behoveth him to act in the preſent Caſe, and that it would be <hi>unreaſonable</hi> or <hi>ſinful</hi> to act otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>So that let our Adverſaries make the moſt of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words that they can, it is a very <hi>Illogical</hi> Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſay, That whoever Acts with a <hi>Doubt</hi> upon his Conſcience in any Caſe, is guilty of Sin; and much more is it ſo, to affirm it in our preſent Caſe of <hi>Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authority.</hi> For it is certain, that many Men are (and I believe all Men may be) ſatisfied, that in a pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>doubtful</hi> Caſe, it is not only more <hi>reaſonable,</hi> but their <hi>Duty</hi> to Obey their Superiours.</p>
                        <p>Well, But it will be ſaid, Do not we here talk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions? Can a Man have <hi>Faith</hi> about an Action, that is, be <hi>reſolved</hi> in his own Conſcience that ſuch an Action is to be done, or may lawfully be done, and yet <hi>Doubt</hi> concerning it at the ſame time?</p>
                        <p>I Anſwer, This is ſo far from being a Contradiction, that it is a Caſe that every day happens, where a Man hath a <hi>Doubt</hi> on both ſides, as it is in the Inſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. A man often hath very great Doubts of the Lawfulneſs of this or the other Action, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Action in general: But yet when he comes to weigh the Circumſtances he is in, and the Reaſons
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52190:277"/> he hath in thoſe Circumſtances for the doing the Action; he may be perſwaded, that it is better for him to do the Action, than to let it alone, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Doubts he hath about it. That is, Though he doubt of the Lawfulneſs of the Action it ſelf, conſidered without his preſent Circumſtances; yet as it comes Circumſtantiated to him, he doth not doubt but it may be lawfully done by him. But of this I have ſpoke largly before, in my Explication of the Rule of a Doubting Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>But is not all <hi>Doubting</hi> contrary to <hi>Faith?</hi> I anſwer, No, it is not: For ſuch kind of <hi>Doubting</hi> as we here ſpeak of, doth, we ſee, very well conſiſt with <hi>Faith.</hi> My meaning is, it is not neceſſary, in order to a Mans having <hi>Faith</hi> about an Action, that all his <hi>Doubts</hi> concerning that Action ſhould be <hi>deſtroyed;</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſufficient that they be <hi>over-ballanced.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That which I would ſay, is this. Whereever a man hath ſuch a degree of <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> touching any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is deliberating about, that he believes it more adviſable to a reaſonable man, all things conſidered, to <hi>do</hi> than Action, than to <hi>forbear</hi> it; ſuch a man hath all the <hi>Faith</hi> that is needful to the doing that Action with a ſafe Conſcience; though in the mean time he may have ſuch <hi>Doubts</hi> concerning that Action, as will perhaps be too hard for him to <hi>reſolve,</hi> and will create him likewiſe ſome trouble and uneaſineſs in the doing of it. Though indeed, to ſpeak properly, I think theſe ought not any longer to be called <hi>Doubts,</hi> after they are thus <hi>over-ruled</hi> or <hi>over-ballanced;</hi> but rather to go under the Name and Notion of pure <hi>Scruples,</hi> which the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> of all Perſwaſions do not only allow, but adviſe that a man ſhould act againſt.</p>
                        <p>In plain Engliſh, That Doubtfulneſs about an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, and which he Cenſures
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52190:277"/> as a ſin; was ſuch a <hi>Doubtfulneſs,</hi> as after the Action was done, rendred the man <hi>Self-condemned;</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience could not but reproach him for doing as he did: But now in our Caſe, the Man is not at all <hi>Self-condemned,</hi> becauſe he hath the Teſtimony of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that he hath acted according to the beſt of his Judgment and Diſcretion. Though he acts with a <hi>Doubt,</hi> yet he is ſatisfied he hath made the moſt <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> Choice that he could in his Circumſtances. And whereever a man doth ſo, he both acts in <hi>Faith,</hi> and without any danger of Condemnation from his own Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>So that after all the Buſtle that is made about <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>forbearing</hi> an Action with a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience; you ſee there is no great intricacy in the Caſe, nor any neceſſity of <hi>ſinning</hi> on both hands, always ſuppoſing a man to be Sincere and Honeſt. For if he be really ſo, he will always do that which he judges moſt according to his Duty, or at leaſt, that which he judges to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it; and whereever a man doth thus, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he Acts with a ſafe Conſcience, notwithſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Doubt</hi> he may have about the Action. Becauſe more than the former a man <hi>cannot</hi> do, and more than the latter he is not <hi>bound</hi> to do.</p>
                        <p>As for what ſins an <hi>Erroneous Conſcience</hi> may ingage a man in; or what troubleſome Reflections a <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Imagination</hi> may occaſion to him in theſe Caſes; I am not to anſwer for them, they are of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Having thus largly treated of the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> and of the <hi>Rules</hi> by which a man is to Act, whenever it happens; and that, both when he is left at his own <hi>Liberty,</hi> and when he is under the the <hi>Commands</hi> of others: All that remains to be done, is to ſpeak ſomething about the <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Obligation</hi>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:52190:278"/> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience;</hi> which is our <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt general Head.</p>
                        <p>But in truth the Diſcuſſion of this might very well be ſpared, after what I have ſaid relating to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſeveral places of the foregoing Diſcourſe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly under my laſt Head. However I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give ſome Account of this Point; though I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it a very ſhort one, becauſe, indeed what I have to offer is not ſo much any new matter, as an Application of the Principles I have before laid down to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>The Point in queſtion is concerning the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience:</hi> Or, Whether a <hi>Doubting Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> doth bind at all, and how far?</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to this, I ſay in general; It is certain that a <hi>Doubting</hi> Conſcience of it ſelf lays no Obligation at all upon a man any way: Indeed it is a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to ſuppoſe that it ſhould.</p>
                        <p>For, I pray, What is the Notion of a <hi>Doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> but this, That a man is uncertain or unreſolved in his mind, whether as to this particular Action he be <hi>bound</hi> or not <hi>bound?</hi> To ſuppoſe now, that a man is obliged in Conſcience either way, by vertue of this <hi>Doubt;</hi> is plainly to ſuppoſe, that a man takes himſelf to be <hi>bound,</hi> while yet at the ſame time he is diſputing with himſelf whether he be <hi>bound</hi> or no.</p>
                        <p>To ſpeak this plainer if I can. Since Conſcience, as I have often ſaid, is nothing elſe but a mans <hi>Judgment concerning Actions, whether they be Duties or Sins, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:</hi> And ſince the Law of God <hi>Commanding</hi> or <hi>Forbidding</hi> Actions, or neither <hi>Commanding</hi> or <hi>Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> them; is the only Rule by which a man can judge what Actions are <hi>Duties,</hi> and what are <hi>Sins,</hi> and what are <hi>Indifferent:</hi> It plainly follows, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bound in Conſcience to <hi>do</hi> any Action, which it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52190:278"/> doth not appear to him, that Gods Law hath ſome way or other <hi>Commanded,</hi> and made a <hi>Duty;</hi> or to <hi>Forbear</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Action which he is not convinced in his Judgment, that Gods Law hath ſome where or other <hi>Forbidden,</hi> and ſo made a <hi>Sin.</hi> And therefore, ſince in a Caſe where a Man is purely <hi>Doubtful,</hi> he cannot be ſuppoſed to have any ſuch Convictions that the Law of God doth either <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Forbid</hi> the Action <hi>Doubted</hi> of (for if he had, he would no longer Doubt:) It follows likewiſe by undeniable Conſequence, that a Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not <hi>bound</hi> on either ſide of the Action, but he may either <hi>do</hi> it or <hi>forbear</hi> it with a ſafe Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>So that if there be any Obligation at all upon a man to Act thus, rather than otherwiſe in a Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſe; that Obligation muſt ariſe upon one of theſe two Accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> Either there is ſome <hi>Law</hi> of God concerning a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> which hath tied a man up to ſuch preciſe meaſures of Acting: Or, at leaſt a man hath a <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> that there is ſome ſuch Law of God.</p>
                        <p>Now I grant, That in both theſe Caſes, there doth a direct Obligation paſs upon the mans Conſcience: But then it is to be remembred, that this Obligation doth not ariſe from the mans being <hi>Doubtful</hi> in his <hi>Conſcience;</hi> but from his being <hi>reſolved</hi> in his <hi>Conſcience.</hi> That is to ſay, if there be really any ſuch <hi>Law</hi> of God; it is the Obligation of a <hi>Right Conſcience.</hi> Or if there be not, but the man only judges that there is; it is then the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of an <hi>Erroneous Conſcience:</hi> But as for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience</hi> there is no ſuch thing.</p>
                        <p>The great, therefore, or indeed the only Point that is to be inquired into, in order to the Reſolution of our preſent Queſtion, is this. Whether there be any Law of God which doth determine our Actions one way or other, in the Caſe of a <hi>Doubt;</hi> and what that Law is?</p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52190:279"/>
                        <p>Now in anſwer to this Inquiry, I ſay, That it doth not appear that there is any expreſs Law of God in Holy Scripture, that hath laid any Obligation upon us as to this particular of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> either one way or other.</p>
                        <p>The only Texts that I know of, which are thought to make for this purpoſe, are the two paſſages in the <hi>14th</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which I have before largely given an account of, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the <hi>5th</hi> Verſe, <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</hi> And that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the laſt Verſe, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith.</hi> But now I think I have made it plain, by ſeveral Arguments, that theſe Texts do not at all concern our preſent Caſe of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> properly ſo called.</p>
                        <p>So that there being no expreſs <hi>Particular</hi> Law of God in Scripture, about acting with a <hi>Doubting Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> we ſeem to be left as to that Affair, to the <hi>General</hi> Laws of God, as they are declared, whether by <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the moſt that any Man can be Obliged to by the <hi>General</hi> Laws of God, whether <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Revealed,</hi> in the Caſe of a Doubt, is only theſe two things. Firſt, to uſe his Endeavour to get himſelf as well inſtructed in his Duty as his Circumſtances and Opportunities will allow him. And Secondly, where he is at a loſs for Information in that Caſe, to Act as reaſonably as he can.</p>
                        <p>I do not ſay, that a Man in every Doubtful Caſe that happens, is ſtrictly <hi>obliged</hi> to thus much. But I ſay, it is impoſſible he ſhould be obliged to more. Becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more than this he cannot do; and no man can be obliged to more than is in his Power.</p>
                        <p>Where-ever therefore a Man in a <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſe takes care to obſerve theſe two things, he Acts with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52190:279"/> a <hi>ſafe</hi> Conſcience, however he may act <hi>Doubtingly</hi> in that Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Thus far I think we are clear beyond Exception. But it may be, ſome will not be ſatisfied with this Account of our Point, but will be putting a farther Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>We have before laid down ſeveral <hi>Rules</hi> about a Mans Acting in a <hi>Doubtful Caſe,</hi> the ſum of all which comes to no more than what we have now ſaid, <hi>viz. That in every doubtful Caſe a man is to act as reaſonably as he can.</hi> The Queſtion now is, Whether a man is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>bound</hi> in Conſcience always to follow this Rule? Or, which is to the ſame effect, Whether a man in a matter concerning which he hath only a <hi>pure Doubt,</hi> may not without ſin indifferently chuſe either ſide of the Action, though yet perhaps one ſide doth appear to him more <hi>reaſonable</hi> or more <hi>ſafe</hi> than the other?</p>
                        <p>This Queſtion is indeed more <hi>curious</hi> than <hi>uſeful.</hi> But however, ſince it properly falls under the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are now treating of, and tends ſomewhat to the clearing of it: I ſhall venture to ſay ſomething to it. Only I declare before-hand, that I mean not in what I ſhall ſay, to aſſert any thing <hi>Dogmatically,</hi> but only to propoſe, in order to further Examination: And withal, that whether that which we ſay be true or falſe; it doth not at all affect the Merits of the main Cauſe we have undertaken.</p>
                        <p>That now which I have to ſay to this Queſtion, is this. That though it be eternally <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> and conducing to a mans <hi>Happineſs</hi> both in this World and the other, that he ſhould in all Caſes, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſes, govern his Actions by the beſt Reaſon that he hath, (and certainly the <hi>Wiſer</hi> and the <hi>Better</hi> any man is, the more ſteadily will he purſue this Rule): Yet, on the other hand, I dare not ſay, that a man is ſtrictly bound in Conſcience ſo to do; ſo as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52190:280"/> that he is properly guilty of ſin if he do not.</p>
                        <p>My Reaſon is this. Becauſe there is no Law of God which doth oblige us in all Caſes, to do that which is <hi>Beſt:</hi> And if we be not bound to do always that which is <hi>Beſt,</hi> we are not bound to do always that which is moſt <hi>Reaſonable;</hi> for certainly, that which is <hi>Beſt,</hi> is always moſt <hi>Reaſonable:</hi> And if we be not bound to do that which is moſt <hi>Reaſonable</hi> much leſs are we bound to do that which is <hi>Safeſt,</hi> becauſe that which is <hi>Safeſt,</hi> is not always either <hi>Beſt</hi> or moſt <hi>Reaſonable</hi> And if there be no Law of God that doth oblige us to any of theſe things; then it is certain we do not <hi>ſin</hi> if we Act otherwiſe, For <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, That the firſt of theſe Principles is true, we have as good Proof as can be deſired, <hi>viz.</hi> the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath in the <hi>7th.</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> thus determined: And if that be true, the other two muſt needs be ſo likewiſe, becauſe they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from it by unavoidable Conſequence.</p>
                        <p>Taking now this for granted. I ask what Law doth a man Tranſgreſs, that in a purely Doubtful Caſe chuſeth either ſide indifferently, without reſpect to what is <hi>Safeſt</hi> or moſt <hi>Reaſonable.</hi> Always ſuppoſing that the ſide he chuſeth, be not in it ſelf <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> by God. I ſay, according to theſe Principles he tranſgreſſeth no Law at all, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be ſaid to ſin at all.</p>
                        <p>If the man be at all guilty, it is upon one of theſe accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> either becauſe he Acteth againſt the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate</hi> of his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or becauſe he Acteth againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of God, in preferring that which is leſs <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>ſafe,</hi> before that which is more ſo.</p>
                        <p>Now, Upon the former account he is not at all guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for his Conſcience hath paſſed no <hi>Dictate,</hi> no <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> in this matter, and therefore he cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52190:280"/> to act againſt any ſuch <hi>Dictate</hi> or <hi>Verdict:</hi> The man is in ſuch a ſtate that he either believes he may act as he doth, without violation of his Duty: Or, at leaſt he hath no belief to the contrary; ſo that his <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth not any way <hi>Condemn</hi> him.</p>
                        <p>And as for the other thing, of his not chuſing that ſide of the Doubtful Caſe which appeared to him moſt <hi>reaſonable;</hi> it is true, if there was any Law of God which obliged him to make ſuch a Choice, he would be guilty of ſin if he choſe otherwiſe. But now it doth not appear, that there is any ſuch Law of God. Nay, ſo far from that, that it appears from St. <hi>Paul</hi> that there is no ſuch Law, but that every man is left to his own liberty in this matter; always ſuppoſing that he take care not to chuſe, or do any thing that he judgeth to be inconſiſtent with his Duty; which in our Caſe we do lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>wiſe ſuppoſe.</p>
                        <p>But then having ſaid this, we muſt add further. That though we here have concluded, that no man in a Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Caſe properly ſo called, is ſtrictly obliged by any Law of God under the penalty of <hi>ſin,</hi> to chuſe one ſide more than another, but may indifferently chuſe either.</p>
                        <p>Yet in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, Whoever doth <hi>believe,</hi> or is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi> in his own Mind, either that he ought not at all to Act againſt a <hi>Doubt,</hi> or that in every Doubtful Caſe he is bound to follow the <hi>ſafer</hi> ſide ſuch a man, ſo long as he ſo believes, cannot without ſin Act according to the Principles we have now laid down.</p>
                        <p>And Secondly, We are far from encouraging any man to act thus hand over head in a Doubtful Caſe; much leſs from commending him for ſo doing. For though we ſay, that, ſtrictly ſpeaking, a man doth not ſin which way ſoever he Act in a purely <hi>doubtful</hi> Caſe; yet on the other hand, I think he is but in a low Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation as to <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> that never looks fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52190:281"/> into his Actions, nor takes more care about them, than only that they be not directly <hi>ſinful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He that is heartily Good, will with St. <hi>Paul</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider what things are <hi>Lawful,</hi> but what things are <hi>Expedient</hi> and do <hi>Edifie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It will not ordinarily be ſufficient to ingage ſuch a man in an Action, to ſatisfie him, that he may do that Action without tranſgreſſing any Law of God: But he will examine whether the <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>forbearing</hi> the Action doth more ſerve the ends of Vertue and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And accordingly as that appears to him, ſo will he determine his Choice.</p>
                        <p>In a word, The Better and the more Vertuous any man is, the more delicate and tender ſenſe will he have, not only of that which the Law of God hath preciſely made his Duty, and ſo in a proper Senſe doth <hi>oblige</hi> his Conſcience; but alſo of every thing that is <hi>Reaſonable</hi> and <hi>Excellent,</hi> and <hi>Praiſe-worthy:</hi> So that it will really grate upon his mind, to do many things which, in ſtrict ſpeaking, cannot be accounted unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or forbidden.</p>
                        <p>And thus it is in our preſent Caſe. If we ſuppoſe a man to be a Devout Chriſtian, and a ſincere Lover of God, he will not be able to prevail with himſelf, in a Caſe where he <hi>Doubteth,</hi> to chuſe either ſide indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately (though if he ſhould, I do not know, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what Law of God he tranſgreſſeth): but he will weigh and conſider the Reaſons on both ſides, and that which appears to him after ſuch Conſideration, to be moſt reaſonable, and conducing to Gods Glory, and his own and the Worlds good, that ſhall have the preference.</p>
                        <p>To come to a concluſion. The ſum of what I have now ſaid is this. As Conſcience is the immediate <hi>Guide</hi> of our Actions: So the <hi>Rule</hi> by which Conſcience it ſelf is to be guided, is the Law of God, and nothing elſe.</p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:52190:281"/>
                        <p>Though therefore we cannot be ſafe in following our Conſcience, where our Conſcience is not guided by the Law of God, (becauſe, as I have often ſaid, our falſe Judgment of things doth not cancel our Obligation to act according to what the Laws of God require of us; unleſs we can juſtly plead unblameable Ignorance of thoſe Laws):</p>
                        <p>Yet, on the other hand, where-ever Conſcience tells us, that we muſt <hi>do</hi> this Action, becauſe the Law of God hath commanded it; we muſt <hi>do</hi> it, or we <hi>ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And again, Where-ever Conſcience tells us that we muſt <hi>avoid</hi> this Action, becauſe the Law of God hath <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> it, we muſt <hi>forbear</hi> that Action, or we <hi>ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if Conſcience cannot ſay that this Action is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> or <hi>forbidden;</hi> there we are not tyed under the penalty of <hi>ſinning,</hi> either to <hi>do</hi> or to <hi>forbear</hi> that Action.</p>
                        <p>But yet if a Mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſhould thus ſuggeſt to him; Though I cannot ſay directly that this Action is a <hi>Duty,</hi> or that it is a <hi>ſin,</hi> becauſe I am at a loſs how the Law of God ſtands as to this matter, and conſequently, I cannot lay any direct Obligation upon you either way; yet my advice is, that you would chuſe this way, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the other: For this way, all things conſidered, appears moſt <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> to be choſen, for there is more <hi>Probability</hi> that this is the right way than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or there is leſs <hi>harm,</hi> though you ſhould be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, in going this way than the other: Now in this Caſe, though a man be not properly obliged under the Guilt of <hi>Sin</hi> to obey his Conſcience, becauſe Conſcience doth not propoſe the Choice to him under that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet if he be a Wiſe and a Good man, he will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly chuſe that ſide which Conſcience, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, hath repreſented to him to be the moſt <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> to be choſen.</p>
                        <p>And thus much concerning our <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Head.</p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:52190:282"/>
                        <p>Thus have I largely diſcuſſed the Caſe of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience</hi> in general, and anſwered all the Conſiderable Enquiries that can be made about it. I am not ſenſible that I have left any material difficulty in this Argument untouched; though I am very ſenſible I have ſaid a great deal more than needed, in order to the Reſolution of that Caſe, for the ſake of which, I undertook this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But I intended ſuch a diſcuſſion of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as would ſerve for all other Caſes as well as that.</p>
                        <p>I do not know whether it be needful to make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Application of what I have ſaid upon a Doubting Conſcience to the Caſe of our preſent Diſſenters. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it will not be amiſs if I offer ſomething towards it; if it be but to ſave the Reader who is concerned in that Caſe the Labour and Trouble of doing it.</p>
                        <p>The Caſe which I am to ſpeak to is briefly this. There are ſeveral Perſons that are unſatisfied about the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our Communion, as it is eſtabliſhed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; and that, upon ſeveral Accounts. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Doubt of the Lawfulneſs of all <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer. Others about the Lawfulneſs of <hi>our Form.</hi> Others Doubt about the Lawfulneſs of our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or our way of Adminiſtring the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> And others it may be about other things. None of them can indeed ſay, that any of theſe things do go againſt their Conſcience, or that they believe the uſe of them to be unlawful: For that is the Caſe of a <hi>Reſolved</hi> Conſcience, with which we have nothing here to do: But they are <hi>undetermined</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi> whether they be Lawful or no; and ſo long as they continue under this Suſpence of Judgment, they dare not joyn in our Worſhip; fearing they would ſin againſt God if they ſhould.</p>
                        <p>Now of thoſe that thus Doubt there may be two ſorts.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome perhaps that have only a <hi>Single Doubt</hi>
                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52190:282"/> in this matter. That is to ſay, They make a Doubt whether they may Lawfully <hi>joyn</hi> with us, ſo long as thoſe ſuſpected Conditions are required of them: But they make no Doubt, but are very well ſatisfied that they may Lawfully <hi>Separate</hi> from us.</p>
                        <p>Again there are others that Doubt on <hi>both ſides,</hi> as they have good Reaſon to do. That is, As they Doubt on one hand, whether the Terms of our Communion be not <hi>ſinful:</hi> So they Doubt on the other hand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not <hi>ſinful</hi> to Separate upon account of thoſe Terms.</p>
                        <p>Now of theſe likewiſe, there may be two ſorts.</p>
                        <p>Some perhaps are <hi>equally</hi> Doubtful whether the Terms of our Communion be lawful or no.</p>
                        <p>Others Doubt <hi>unequally;</hi> that is, are more inclined to believe that they are <hi>Sinful</hi> than that they are <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That now which is to be enquired into is; What is moſt Reaſonable and Adviſeable in Point of Conſcience to be done in each of theſe Caſes.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the firſt of theſe Caſes where a man hath only a Doubt on <hi>one</hi> ſide, and that is, Whether he may Lawfully Communicate with us; but he hath no Doubt that he may lawfully Separate. To this I ſay <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the mans Doubting only on <hi>one</hi> ſide in this matter, doth not make it more ſafe for him to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, than if he had Doubted on <hi>both</hi> ſides. Becauſe indeed if he muſt Doubt at all, it is his Duty, he is bound to Doubt on <hi>both</hi> ſides; and he is guilty of groſs and criminal Ignorance of the Laws of God, if he do not. And if ſo, then his Doubting only on <hi>one</hi> ſide, doth not alter the Caſe, but it muſt have the ſame Reſolution as if it was a <hi>Double Doubt</hi> properly ſo called.</p>
                        <p>If it be ſaid that it is a conſtant Rule of a Doubting Conſcience, and we have allowed it as ſuch; that in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52190:283"/> Caſes where a man hath only a Doubt on one ſide of an Action, it is more ſafe to chuſe that ſide on which he hath no Doubt, than that other concerning which he Doubts: I do readily grant it. But then it is to be remembred, that that Rule is always intended, and doth only obtain in ſuch Caſes where a man may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly without danger of ſinning <hi>forbear</hi> that Action of the Lawfulneſs of which he Doubts; though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without danger of ſinning <hi>do</hi> the Action ſo long as he Doubts about it. But now in our Caſe here, it is evident to all men that are not wilfully blind, that as there may be a <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Sinning,</hi> if a man ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with a Doubting Conſcience: So there is certainly a <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Sinning</hi> (nay, and we ſay a much greater <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)</hi> if a man do not conform. So that that Rule hath here no place at all.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, Our Caſe if it be rightly put, is this. A man is here ſuppoſed to reaſon thus with himſelf. <q>I am very well ſatisfied in my own mind, and I make no Doubt at all, that I may Lawfully and without <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of Sin, cut my ſelf off from the Communion of the Church [which yet by his Chriſtianity he is bound to maintain and preſerve as far as he can] And I may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lawfully and without danger of ſinning, live in a conſtant Diſobedience and Refractarineſs to all that Authority that God hath ſet over me [to which yet by as plain Laws as any are in Nature, or the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he is bound to be ſubject:] I ſay I am <hi>ſatisfied</hi> in my own mind, that I may lawfully do both theſe things. But I am very <hi>unſatisfied</hi> and <hi>doubtful</hi> whether in my preſent Circumſtances, it is not my <hi>Duty</hi> thus to do ſo as that I ſhall <hi>Sin</hi> if I do not.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>What now would any Prudent man ſay to this Caſe? Why certainly he would ſay this? That he who can Doubt after this faſhion, is either a very <hi>Ill</hi> man, or a very
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52190:283"/> 
                           <hi>Ignorant</hi> one. And that ſuch a man doth a great deal more ſtand in need of good <hi>Advice,</hi> and wholſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions</hi> about the plain Duties of Chriſtianity; than of <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> how to behave himſelf in <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Caſes. Becauſe indeed the beſt Rules of that kind are not to his Caſe, ſo long as he continues thus Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And if he ſhould obſerve them, yet that would not juſtifie his Acting, if it ſhould indeed prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God, becauſe it was both in his power; and it was his Duty to know better. A mans Right proceeding according to the <hi>Rules</hi> of a <hi>Doubting Conſcience,</hi> in a Caſe where he is entangled by a wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Eroneous</hi> one; will no more diſcharge him from <hi>Sin</hi> as to his <hi>Soul,</hi> if he do an evil Action; than the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Concoction though never ſo regular, can rectifie the Errors of the <hi>Firſt</hi> as to his <hi>Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though that which I have now offered be the proper Anſwer to the Caſe before us: Yet there is this further to be ſaid to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Though we ſhould ſuppoſe that the Law of God had not obliged us to keep the Unity of the Church, or to obey our lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; but had left it as an indifferent matter, and that there was no danger at all in <hi>forbearing</hi> theſe things; but the only danger was in <hi>doing</hi> them: So that the Doubt about Conformity, ſhould have perfectly the Nature of a <hi>Single Doubt</hi> as it is put in the Caſe. I ſay, now even upon this Suppoſition it will bear a juſt Diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Conformity</hi> or <hi>Non-conformity</hi> be the more eligible ſide; Nay, I ſay further, that if the Rule I laid down about a <hi>Single Doubt</hi> be true, it will appear, that as things now ſtand, it is more <hi>reaſonable</hi> for a man to <hi>Obey</hi> the Laws, and <hi>Communicate</hi> with the Church, ſo long as he hath only a bare <hi>Doubt</hi> about the Lawfulneſs of theſe things, than to <hi>Diſobey</hi> and <hi>Separate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For thus I argue. Though in a <hi>Single</hi> Doubt the Rule
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52190:284"/> be, That a man ſhould chuſe that ſide of an Action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he hath <hi>no Doubt;</hi> rather than that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he <hi>Doubts:</hi> Yet as was ſaid before, that Rule is always to be underſtood with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that all other Conſiderations in the Caſe be equal. If it ſhould happen that a very great <hi>Good</hi> may be compaſſed, or a very great <hi>Evil</hi> may be avoided, by Acting on the Doubtful ſide: That very Conſideration hath weight enough with a Wiſe man to turn the Ballance on that ſide; and to make that which abſtractedly conſidered, was a <hi>Doubtful</hi> Caſe, to be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> when it comes clothed with ſuch Circumſtances. As I gave Inſtances in the Caſe of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury</hi> and <hi>Law Suits.</hi> And twenty more might be added to them, if it was to any purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>If this now be admitted for Truth, we have a plain Reſolution of the Caſe before us, and that is this. There are ſo many great Advantages both to the Kingdom, and to a mans ſelf, to be obtained by Worſhiping God in the way of the Church; and likewiſe ſo many both <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> and <hi>Private</hi> Miſchiefs and Inconveniences that are conſequent upon Separation: That if in any Caſe theſe Conſiderations have weight enough to Over-ballance a ſimple Doubt about the Lawfulneſs of an Action, they will certainly have ſufficient weight in this Caſe. And that man who is not ſwayed by them, doth not Act ſo reaſonably as he might do.</p>
                        <p>For my part, I ſhould think it very fooliſhly done of any man, that ſo long as he is utterly uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in the right or in the wrong (as every one that Doubteth is) ſhould be ſo confident of his Point; as to venture upon it no leſs a ſtake than the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> where he lives, and the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> Eſtabliſhed; and withal his own <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>Fortunes</hi> alſo of his Poſterity. And yet ſuch a wiſe Venture as this doth every one among us
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52190:284"/> make, that upon the account of a bare <hi>Doubt</hi> about the Lawfuleſs of the things enjoyned in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, doth perſiſt in diſobedience to the Government, and Separation from the Church.</p>
                        <p>I wiſh this was well conſidered by our Doubting Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: They are wiſe enough as to the World in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; it is to be deſired that they would be as wiſe in this. And if they were, I dare ſay it would not at all prejudice their Wiſdom as to the other World. It will be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle either to their Comfort or their Reputation at the long run, to have it ſaid of them; that beſides the Diſturbance they have all along occaſioned to the Publick <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> they have alſo brought their <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> into danger of Ruine, by the juſt Proſecutions of Law they have drawn upon themſelves; and all this for the ſake of a Cauſe which they themſelves muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, they are altogether uncertain and unreſolved about.</p>
                        <p>But this will appear much clearer, when we have ſet the <hi>Doubt</hi> about <hi>Conformity</hi> upon the right Foot, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſidered it as a <hi>Double Doubt,</hi> as indeed it is, in its own Nature: Which I come now to do.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> place, There are other Diſſenters who (as they have good reaſon) do <hi>Doubt</hi> on <hi>both</hi> ſides of this Queſtion. As they Doubt on one hand, whether it be not a <hi>ſin</hi> to Conform to our Worſhip; becauſe there are ſeveral things in it which they ſuſpect to be unlawful: So on the other hand, they Doubt whether it be not their <hi>Duty</hi> to Conform to it; becauſe the Laws of the Church and of the Land, do require them ſo to do. And of theſe, as I ſaid, there are likewiſe <hi>two</hi> ſorts. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are <hi>equally</hi> Doubtful whether the Terms of our Communion are Lawful or no, and conſequently muſt Doubt <hi>equally</hi> whether they be bound to Conform or no. Others Doubt <hi>unequally.</hi> That is to ſay, of the Two, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more <hi>probable</hi> to them, that our Communion is <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> than that it is a <hi>Duty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52190:285"/>
                        <p>Now as to the firſt of theſe Caſes, The Anſwer is very ſhort, and it is this. <q>We have before proved by many Arguments, that in a Caſe of a <hi>Pure</hi> Doubt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lawfulneſs of an Action where the <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> on both ſides are pretty <hi>equal:</hi> In that Caſe the Command of Authority doth always turn the Ballance on its own ſide; ſo, as that it is not only reaſonable for the man to do that in Obedience to Authority, of the Lawfulneſs of which he Doubteth; but it is his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do it; he ſins if he do not. For this I refer my Reader to the <hi>Third</hi> General Head of this Diſcourſe.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The only difficulty therefore is in the other Caſe, where the Doubt is <hi>unequal.</hi> And here the Caſe is this. As the man apprehends himſelf in danger of ſinning if he do not come to Church, and obey the Laws: So he apprehends himſelf in a <hi>greater</hi> danger of ſinning if he do. Becauſe it doth appear more <hi>probable</hi> to him, that our Communion is <hi>Sinful,</hi> than that it is a <hi>Duty:</hi> And a greater Probobility, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> is always to be choſen before a leſs.</p>
                        <p>But to this likewiſe we are ready provided of an Anſwer from the foregoing Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                           <q>That though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that in ſuch a Caſe as this, where the Ballance is ſo far inclined one way; the Authority of our Superiors alone will not have weight enough to caſt it on its own ſide: Yet in this Particular Caſe of Church Communion, there are ſo many other Arguments to be drawn from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>greater Sin,</hi> and the more <hi>dreadful Conſequences,</hi> of diſobeying the Laws than of obeying them; as will with any Impartial Conſcientious Man out-weigh all the <hi>Probabilities</hi> on the other ſide, ſo long as they are not ſo great as to create a <hi>Perſwaſion;</hi> and make it reaſonable for him rather to <hi>Conform,</hi> how ſtrong ſoever his <hi>Doubt</hi> be about the Lawfulneſs of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> (ſo long as it is but a <hi>Doubt;)</hi> than to continue in <hi>Separation. Vide</hi> Third Propoſition about a <hi>Double Doubt.</hi> pag. 27.</q>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:52190:285"/>
                        <p>This is the Iſſue upon which we will try the Point before us, and I refuſe no indifferent Man, that will but have the Patience to hear what we have to ſay, to be <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire</hi> between us and our Diſſenting Brethren, as to this Controverſie.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, let us ſuppoſe and admit, that the man who hath theſe Doubts and Suſpicions about the Lawfulneſs of our Eſtabliſhed Worſhip, doth really Doubt on the true ſide; and that he would indeed be a Tranſgreſſor of the Law of God, if he ſhould Conform to it. But then it muſt be admitted likewiſe, that That Law of God which forbids theſe things in diſpute, is wonderfully obſcurely declared.</p>
                        <p>There are no direct Prohibitions, either in the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> or the Book of <hi>God</hi> about thoſe things that are now Conteſted; ſo that the unlawfulneſs of them is only to be concluded from Conſequences.</p>
                        <p>And thoſe Conſequences likewiſe are ſo obſcure, that the Catholick Church from Chriſts time till our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was wholly ignorant of them. For though it doth appear, that either theſe, or the like Uſages, have always been in the Church: Yet it doth not appear, in all that compaſs of Time, either that any Particular Church ever condemned them as ſinful: Or indeed, that any Particular Chriſtian did ever Separate from the Church upon the Account of them.</p>
                        <p>And even at this Day, theſe Conſequences by which they are proved unlawful, are not diſcovered by our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> No, nor by as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Religious <hi>Divines</hi> of all Perſwaſions as any in the World.</p>
                        <p>The moſt Divines, by far the moſt; and thoſe as Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and as Able as any, are clearly of Opinion, that there is nothing <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> in our Worſhip; but that, on the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52190:286"/> contrary, all things therein preſcribed are at leaſt Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and free from ſin, if not Pure and Apoſtolical.</p>
                        <p>So that if it ſhould at laſt prove, that they are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken: Yet the Law of God, which forbids theſe things, being ſo very obſcure, and the Senſe of it ſo hardly to be found out; it is a great Preſumption that a man may very innocently and inculpably be Ignorant of it. And if ſo, it will be a very little, or no ſin at all in him to act againſt it. Becauſe if it was not his Duty to know this Law, it cannot be his Sin that his Practice is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. And if it was his Duty to know it, yet it being ſo obſcurely delivered, and only to be gathered by ſuch remote Conſequences; it can at moſt be but a <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> in an ordinary Perſon, where ſo many of the beſt Guides are miſtaken, if he ſhould tranſgreſs it.</p>
                        <p>And then farther, This muſt likewiſe be conſidered. That if Conformity to our Liturgy and Worſhip ſhould prove a ſin in any Inſtance: Yet the Evil Conſequences of it extend no farther than the Mans Perſon that is guilty of it. There is no damage ariſeth either to the Chriſtian Religion, or to the Publick Intereſt of the Kingdom, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans being a Conformiſt. But on the contrary, as things ſtand with us; <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed way, ſeem to bring a great advantage to both (as I hinted before) and to be a probable means to ſecure us from many Dangers, with which our Reformed Religion, and the Peace of the Kingdom is threatned.</p>
                        <p>Well, but now on the other hand. Let us ſuppoſe the contrary ſide of the Queſtion to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Governours in this matter are in the <hi>Right,</hi> and we are in the <hi>Wrong.</hi> That there is nothing required of us in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a Term of Communion, but what is very Innocent and Lawful; however it be our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to Doubt that there is, and in a zealous Indulgence
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52190:286"/> to theſe Doubts, we take the liberty to live in open diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to our Lawful Governous, and to break the Unity of the Church into which we were Baptized.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, admitting the thing to be thus; what kind of <hi>Sin</hi> ſhall we be guilty of then? Why certainly we are guilty of no leſs a Sin than cauſleſly <hi>dividing</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> againſt which we are ſo ſeverely cautioned in the New Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>We are guilty of the Breach of as plain Laws as any are in the Bible, <hi>viz.</hi> Of all thoſe that oblige us to <hi>keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace:</hi> that Command us to <hi>Obey thoſe that are over us in the Lord; to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higher Powers; to ſubmit to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake; to be ſubject not only for Wrath. but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> I ſay, theſe plain Laws we <hi>diſobey</hi> for <hi>Conſcience ſake;</hi> and we diſobey them too in ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, where we have the whole Catholick Church of old, and far the greateſt and the beſt part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church, of a different Perſwaſion from us.</p>
                        <p>Well, but as if this was not enough. What are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this our Sin? (For by the Conſequences of a ſin, the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of it is always to be eſtimated, I ſpeak as to the <hi>Material</hi> part of it, with which we are here concerned.) Why, they are moſt Terrible and Dreadful, both with reſpect to our ſelves and others.</p>
                        <p>By this unnatual Separation, we do, for any thing we know, put our ſelves out of the Communion of the Catholick Church; and conſequently out of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ordinary means of Salvation.</p>
                        <p>We maintain and keep up Diviſions and Diſorders in the Church, and lend a helping hand to all thoſe Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Hatreds, all that bitter Contention and Strife, and Uncharitableneſs, which hath long torn the very Bowels of Chriſts Church, and given occaſion to that Deluge of Atheiſm, and Profaneneſs, and Impiety which hath over-ſpread the Face of it.</p>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:52190:287"/>
                        <p>We put Affronts upon our Lawful Governours, who ſhould be in the place of God to us. We give Scandal to all our Brethren that make a Conſcience of living Peaceably and Piouſly. And laſtly, as we offer a very fair Handle and Pretence to all Diſcontented and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men to Practice againſt the Beſt of <hi>Governments:</hi> So we take the moſt effectual courſe to Ruine the Beſt Conſtituted <hi>Church</hi> in the World, and with it the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>This now being the Nature, and theſe being the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of our <hi>Separation</hi> from the Eſtabliſhed Church among us: I leave it to any indifferent man to Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether any <hi>Doubt</hi> about the Lawfulneſs of our Communion, though that Doubt be backed with greater <hi>Probabilities</hi> than do appear on the other ſide; nay, if you will, with all the <hi>Probabilities</hi> that can conſiſt with the nature of a Doubt; can have weight enough to Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt ſuch a <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſuch Conſequences as Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in our Caſe doth involve a man in? I think there is no unconcerned Perſon but will pronounce, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing where there are Doubts on both ſides, a man is to chuſe that ſide on which there is the leaſt <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>Sin;</hi> he is in this Caſe certainly bound to chuſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with the Eſtabliſhed Church, rather than <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from it. And that is all I Contend for.</p>
                        <p>But now, after all this is ſaid; it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that if there be any man who hath other apprehenſions of theſe matters, and that after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all things that are to be ſaid for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conformity, it doth appear to him upon the whole matter, both more <hi>probable</hi> that our Communion is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than that it is a Duty; and withal, that to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with us, will involve him in a <hi>greater ſin,</hi> and in worſe <hi>Conſequences,</hi> than to continue in Separation: I ſay, if any man have ſo unfortunate an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52190:287"/> as to make ſuch an eſtimate of things; we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that according to all the Rules of a Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcience, ſuch a man is rather to continue a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt, than to obey the Laws of the King and the Church. But then let him look to it; for his acting in this Caſe according to the beſt Rules of a Doubting Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will not (as I ſaid before) at all acquit him either of the Guilt or Conſequences of Criminal Schiſm and Diſobedience: Suppoſing that indeed he is all along un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a miſtake as (we ſay) he certainly is; and that there is nothing required in our Communion, that he might not honeſtly and lawfully comply with, as there certainly is not. Unleſs in the mean time, the man fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe miſtakes without any fault of his, and God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who is the Judge of all mens Hearts and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, doth know he had not means and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to underſtand better.</p>

                        <head>A DISCOURSE ABOUT A Scrupulous Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IT is not my Deſign in the following Diſcourſe, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or upbraid the Weakneſs of any of our Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren; but rather charitably to contribute what I can towards the healing and curing of it: and this I take for granted, That we cannot do greater Service ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Church of Chriſt, or Souls of Men, than by all prudent Means to root thoſe needleſs Scruples out of their Minds, which have been the Occaſion of ſuch unchriſtian Separations and dangerous Diviſions amongſt us; at firſt begun, and ſtill maintained, generally, upon the Account of ſuch Things, as I verily believe, a well-inſtructed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience need not be concerned or diſturbed about.</p>
                        <p>Here I ſhall firſt ſhew what I underſtand by a Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſcience, then obſerve ſome few things concerning it; and laſtly, offer ſome plain Rules and Means by which we may beſt get rid of it.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, What is a Scrupulous Conſcience? Now Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as it is a Rule of our Actions, is nothing elſe but a Man's Mind or Judgment concerning the moral Goodneſs or Evil, Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of Things; and as this Judgment is either true or falſe, ſo is our Conſcience
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:290"/> either good and well-grounded, or erroneous. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law made known to us either by the light of Nature, or plain Scripture, or direct conſequence from it, ſuch as any honeſt man may underſtand, is the Rule of Conſcience, or of that Judgment we make of the lawfulneſs or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of things: ſo that our Conſcience is a ſafe Rule and Guide of Actions no further, than as it ſelf is directed and warranted by the Law of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A good and well grounded Conſcience is, when we carefully abſtain from whatever God hath forbidden, don't neglect doing any thing which he hath commanded, and as for other Mattes left indifferent and at liberty, we do them or forbea doing of them, according as the Rules of obedience to Superiours, Prudence, and Charity, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. This is the Health and ſound State of the Mind.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An erroneous Conſcience is, when we judge that to be evil or unneceſſary which God hath expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is our Duty; or that to be good and neceſſary which he hath plainly forbid, and is really ſinful. Now our Conſciences cannot alter the nature of things: that which is our Duty remaineth ſo, and we ſin by omitting it, notwithſtanding we in our Conſciences think it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done; and what is really Evil continueth ſuch, and is Sin in us, however our Conſciences tell us it is our duty to do it: and the fault is more or leſs compaſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pardonable, as the cauſes of the Error are more or leſs voluntary and avoidable. This is a grievous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and deadly Sickneſs of the Mind, when we thus groſly err in our Judgments, and act according to our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Opinion of Things.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A ſcrupulous Conſcience is converſant about things in their own Nature indifferent, and it conſiſts</p>
                        <p>Either in ſtrictly tying up our ſelves to ſome things which God hath no where commanded; as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made great conſcience of waſhing before they did eat, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:290"/> abundance of other unneceſſary Rites and Uſages they had of Mens own inventing and deviſing, which they as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, nay more carefully obſerved than the indiſputable Commands of God himſelf:</p>
                        <p>Or in a conſcientious abſtaining from ſomethings which are not forbid, nor any ways unlawful. <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not,</hi> doubting and fearing where no Fear is, thinking that they ſhould as much offend God by eating ſome kind of Meats, wearing ſome Garments, as they ſhould do were they guilty of Murder and Adultery. Which is the Caſe of many amongſt us, who by ſuch Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity about little matters, ſeem more preciſe and auſtere than other good and honeſt Chriſtians are, or themſelves need or ought to be.</p>
                        <p>Far be it from me, by any thing I ſhall now ſay, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the greateſt and tendereſt care any Chriſtian can take, to keep himſelf from all Sin, from all Occaſions and Temptations to it, from the leaſt appearance of Evil, of what is really ſuch: and to do any thing that is in it ſelf ſinful, out of confidence that it is lawful, is far worſe and a more grievous Offence than to abſtain from many things which are truly lawful, out of an Opinion that they are ſinful. Notwithſtanding this, I cannot but reckon it the chief Policy of the Devil, the grand Enemy of all that is good, when he cannot perſuade us that there is nothing at all ſinful or unlawful, than to make us ſuſpect every thing for ſuch, or at leaſt, that there is great danger of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God by the moſt indifferent and innocent Actions; by theſe means enſnaring and entangling Mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and rendring Religion a moſt troubleſome Burden to them.</p>
                        <p>A ſcrupulous Conſcience therefore ſtarts and boggles, where there is no real Evil or Miſchief; is afraid of omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or doing what may be omitted or done without Sin. Which I know not how better to illuſtrate than by thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:291"/> unaccountable Antipathies or Prejudices that ſome men have againſt ſome ſort of Meats, or living Creatures, which have not the leaſt harm or hurt in them, yet are ſo offenſive and dreadful to ſuch Perſons, that they fly from them as they would from a Tyger or Bear, and avoid them as they would do the Plague or Poyſon. Juſt thus do ſome Men run out of the Church at the ſight of a Surplice, as if they had been ſcared by the Apparition of a Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p>I proceed to the ſecond thing I propounded, to obſerve to you ſome few general things concerning this ſcrupulous Conſcience; as,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That this is a very ſickly, crazy temper of Mind, a great Indiſpoſition, a ſtate of Weakneſs and Infirmity, It ariſeth from Ignorance and want of right Underſtanding our Religion, from undue timerouſneſs or unſetledneſs of Mind, from Melancholy, or unreaſonable Prejudices and Miſtakes about the Nature of things. Such ſcrupulous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are like fearful Women, that wander in the Dark, who ſeeing nothing to affright them, yet fancy many things, which make them tremble every ſtep they take: or like thoſe who ſee only by an uncertain glimmering twilight, their Imagination once abus'd and prepoſſeſs'd, transforms every Object into a Monſter or Gyant.</p>
                        <p>Thus this Scrupulous is the ſame with what in other Words ſome call a tender Conſcience, ſo tender that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hurts and wounds it, like a tender Eye which the leaſt Duſt or Smoke greviouſly offends, or a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Body, which the leaſt Air or Wind mightily diſorders and diſcompoſes. Now this is far from being any Vertue or Commendation in us, this is no deſirable Qualification, nor a matter of Ambition to be thought Men of ſuch tender Conſciences, no more than it is for a Man's Reputation to be ſickly and often indiſpos'd. A good Conſcience is firm and ſteady, well ſetled and reſolved, and ſuch needleſs Scruples about things lawful are at the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:291"/> beſt a ſign of an ungovern'd Fancy, and a weak Judgment. As the niceneſs and ſqueamiſhneſs of a mans Stomach that diſtaſts wholſom Food is a ſymptom of an unſound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy Body. This doth not argue any extraordinary holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or purity above others, as the Phariſee conceited of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Stand off, come not nigh me, touch me not, for I am holier than thou,</hi> becauſe he waſhed himſelf ſo often. No, we are yet in a childiſh ſtate, and whilſt we are frighted with ſuch Bug-bears and Phantaſms, we have not yet arrived to the Underſtanding or Reſolution of a Man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This Scrupuloſity about little matters may be, and is often a ſign of Hypocriſie. I take not upon my ſelf to judge any Perſons. Let every man look to himſelf; but thus certainly it was with the Scribes and Phariſees of old; They ſtrained at every Gnat, ſtumbled at every Straw, would ſtarve ſooner than eat their Meat with defiled hands, would not for the World wrong a Man of a Cummin-ſeed, or a ſpear of Mint, and by this wonderful exactneſs and ſtrictneſs in ſome inſtances, they eaſily gained the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greateſt Saints; ſo that it is ſaid to have been an ordinary Proverb among the Jews, <hi>That if but two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World went to Heaven, one of them would be a Scribe the other a Phariſee.</hi> Yet for all this, if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Saviour's account of them, they made nothing of ſwallowing Camels, living in the greateſt and moſt known Wickedneſs.</p>
                        <p>Alas! their Conſciences would not give them leave to enter into the Governours Hall to go amongſt the Heathens, for fear of being polluted by them, yet at the ſame time they ſtuck not at ſuborning falſe Witneſſes againſt the beſt and moſt innocent Perſon that ever lived. They blamed the Diſciples for plucking the ears of Corn on the Sabbath-day, as if they, poor tender-hearted men, were offended and grieved to the Soul at ſuch Prophaneneſs, and yet they thought it nothing to deny relief and ſuccour to their own
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:292"/> Parents, when in Want or Diſtreſs; they made no Bones of Rapine and Extortion, oppreſſing the Poor, or devouring Widows Houſes. By their curioſity about ſome external Obſervances, they hoped to make amends for their groſs Tranſgreſſions in other Caſes of far greater weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Since they denied themſelves many things which God had allow'd them, they hop'd he would readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, tho in ſome other things they took a greater Liberty than he had permitted them.</p>
                        <p>Had any of us been preſent when <hi>Mary,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> 12. 3. took the Ointment of Spikenard, very coſtly, and anointed the Feet of Jeſus, and had heard <hi>Judas</hi>'s Rebuke, <hi>Why was not this Ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the Poor?</hi> (He ſcrupled ſuch a profuſe expence, tho about our Saviour himſelf. He thought it might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employ'd, to more uſeful purpoſes.) Should we not from this have ſtrait concluded him the moſt charitable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious of all Chriſt's Diſciples, and yet this over-great care for the Poor was only a pretence and covering for his theeviſh Intention.</p>
                        <p>They therefore who are ſo ſcrupulous about little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different matters, ought to approve their Honeſty and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity by the moſt accurate Diligence in the Practiſe of all other Duties of Religion, which are plainly and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſuch. They who pretend to ſuch a tender Conſcience above other Men muſt know, that the World will watch them as to the fairneſs and juſtice of their Dealings, the calmneſs of their Tempers, their behaviour in their ſeveral Relations, their Modeſty, Humility, Charity, Peaceableneſs, and the like. If in all theſe things they keep the ſame Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, uſe the ſame caution and circumſpection, and be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly conſcientious, then it muſt be acknowledged, that it is only Weakneſs or Ignorance that raiſeth their Scruples, not any vicious Principle; and the condition of thoſe who are under the Power of ſuch Scruples, is much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerated.</p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:292"/>
                        <p>But, when I ſee a Man ſcrupling praying by a Book or Form, and yet living without any ſenſe of God or fear of him, afraid of a Ceremony in God's Worſhip, and not afraid of a plain damnable Sin, of Covetouſneſs, raſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring his Brethren, of Hatred and Strife, Faction and Schiſm, and Diſobedience to Superiours; when I ſee one that out of Conſcience refuſeth to kneel at the Sacrament, and yet dares totally neglect the Communion; who takes great care not to give offence to his weak Brother, but can freely ſpeak evil of Dignities, and deſpiſeth his lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; it is not then uncharitable to ſay, That it is not dread of diſpleaſing God, but ſome other bye end or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that acts and moves ſuch a Perſon, and in pleading the Tenderneſs of his Conſcience he is no other than a downright Hypocrite.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, Let a Man be never ſo punctual and critical in his Conformity to all the appointed Ceremonies and Uſages in our Church, let him conſtantly attend God's ſolemn Worſhip, and behave himſelf moſt reverently and decently at the Publick Prayers; yet if this Man be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and intemperate, a Derider of true Piety and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if he lives looſly and at Random, all his regular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, all his bowing and kneeling to the Honour of our Saviour, all his niceneſs about his Worſhip to perform it in the moſt orderly manner, all his Zeal for the Church ſhall avail him nothing. He is no better than the Phariſee, waſhing the out-ſide, whilſt he is within full of all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Uncleanneſs. To be ſo concerned about little things, whilſt we make no Conſcience of the greater, is the moſt evident ſign that can be given of a falſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. And hath it not often hapned in the World, that ſuch a mighty Scrupuloſity about our Duty hath proved a very ſucceſsful way of growing great or raiſing an Eſtate, by giving Men ſo fair an opportunity of impoſing upon the credulous and unwary? So that I have known it adviſed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:293"/> as an uſeful Caution to thoſe who would live in the World, always to ſtand upon your Guard and look to your Pockets, when you deal with thoſe who pretend to greater Tenderneſs and Exactneſs than other undoubtedly ſober and honeſt Chriſtians generally do.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Where Perſons are truly honeſt and mean well, there is nothing more troubleſome and vexatious than ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Scruples about things lawful. This muſt needs be an intolerable diſturbance to a man's Mind, and breed great Anxiety and Inquietude, when Perſons are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhivering and trembling leſt by every thing they do they incur the Divine Diſpleaſure; and it certainly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a man from performing his neceſſary Duty. He is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make but a ſlow Progreſs in his Journey, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going on cheerfully in his way, is frequently at a ſtand, doubting which foot he ſhould ſet forward, or what particular Path he ſhould chooſe. This robs men, in a great meaſure, of that Peace and Satisfaction which they might otherwiſe find in Religion, whilſt they are daily perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with untying Knots which themſelves only have faſtned. Scruples about things indifferent, when once we attend to and entertain them, like the Plague of Flies amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> will be conſtantly buzzing in our Ears, and tormenting us with their Impertinency; till at length we come to diſtruſt every thing, and there is nothing that belongs to ordinary Civility, no recreation we can uſe, no cloaths we can wear, no diſcourſe we can hold with others, no converſation we can maintain, or buſineſs which we tranſact in the World, but we ſhall raiſe ſome trifling Objections or Scruples about it, which will make our Condition continually uneaſie and reſtleſs. For,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Theſe Scruples are infinite and endleſs: for, being grounded upon ſome very little and inconſiderable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is hardly any thing to be done but ſome ſmall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:293"/> Exceptions may be ſtarted againſt it, which may ſoon puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle and confound the more ignorant ſort of Chriſtians. Thus he that ſcruples a Miniſter's officiating in a white Garment, may eaſily be brought to doubt of the fitneſs of his doing it in Black, and then he proceeds againſt any ſolemn diſtinct Habit, and at laſt againſt the Office of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters it ſelf, and tells you all Gods People are holy, and that all Chriſtians are a Royal Prieſthood, and we have no need of Teachers, for we are all taught of God. From ſcrupling the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> after Baptiſm, Men have ſoon come to queſtion Infant Baptiſm it ſelf: they have at firſt perchance diſliked only ſome ſignificant Ceremonies in God's Worſhip, of Humane Appointment, but thence they have gone on to deny all outward bodily Reverence, and thought it not expedient to pull off their Hats in Churches, then not to do it before Magiſtrates, at laſt not at all: and thus by giving place to ſuch little Scruples, they become afraid of ſpeaking, looking, or doing any thing like other Men.</p>
                        <p>This is notorious amongſt us. Thoſe who have taken Offence at ſome things in our Church, and have thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeparated from us, and aſſocited themſelves with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Congregation, have ſoon diſliked ſomething amongſt them alſo; and then they would reform themſelves far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after that refine themſelves more ſtill, till at laſt they have ſunk down either into Quakeriſm, Popery, or Atheiſm. This doth not only now and then happen in the World, but is the probable effect of embracing and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſuch Scruples, that men go on ſcrupling one thing after another, till at length they doubt of every thing.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Laſtly, This needleſs ſcrupling of lawful things hath done unſpeakable miſchief to the Church of Chriſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Reformed <hi>Church of England;</hi> a Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to the moſt Primitive and Apoſtolical Pattern, by the beſt and wiſeſt Rules, in which, even by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:294"/> the Confeſſion of the ſobereſt and moſt conſiderable of our Diſſenters nothing is required, as a condition of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is ſinful; yet how is ſhe rent and torn, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and divided, how hath ſhe been aſſaulted, undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in danger to be the ſecond time overthrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account only of Habits and Geſtures, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Forms, Rites, and Modes of Diſcipline and Worſhip, with which ſome Men are not well ſatisfied or pleaſed, which they judge might be better done and ordered ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, or which they rather would have left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that every man may do therein according to his own Diſcretion or Opinion.</p>
                        <p>In the great and neceſſary Truths of Religion we all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be agreed. We all worſhip the ſame God, believe in the ſame Lord and Saviour, have the ſame Baptiſm, the ſame Faith, the ſame Hope, the ſame common Intereſt, our Sacraments, as to the main, are rightly adminiſtred accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Saviour's Inſtitution, our Churches are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be true Churches of <hi>Jeſus Christ:</hi> but there are ſome Conſtitutions, which reſpect chiefly outward Order and the decent Performance of Divine Worſhip, againſt which men have received ſtrange Prejudices, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them have raiſed a mighty noiſe and clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, and have openly ſeparated from its Communion, as if by renouncing of Popery we had only exchanged one idolatrous Service for another. About theſe skirts and Borders, the dreſs and circumſtances of Religion hath been all our quarelling and contention; and theſe Differences have proceeded to ſuch an height, as to beget immortal Feuds and Animoſities, to break and crumble us into little Parties and Fractions, whereby mutual Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is hindred, our common Religion ſuffers Reproach, the Enemies of it are ſtrengthned and encouraged, publick Peace endangered, and brotherly Love, the Badge of Chriſt's Diſciples, quite loſt amongſt us: and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:294"/> of theſe miſerable Diſtractions amongſt us upon ſuch frivolous Accounts (if compared with the Intereſts of Peace and Charity) is a matter of ſad conſideration to all lively Members of Chriſt's Body, and forebodes great evils impendent over our Church and State. I doubt not to ſay, that the Devil hath fought more ſucceſsfully againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under the Mask of a zealous Reformer, than under any other diſguiſe whatever.</p>
                        <p>The grand Enemy of Mankind hath by various ways and means all along contriv'd and endeavoured to defeat the deſigns of Heaven for the Good and Happineſs of Men: and as the Divine Wiſdom hath in ſeveral Ages of the World manifeſted it ſelf for the encouraging and promoting of true Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, ſo hath the Devil always been at work to oppoſe what he could find moſt proper for the hindring the good effect of God's Kindneſs towards us. When the fullneſs of Time came, by the appearance of the Son of God in the World, he was in a great meaſure dethroned, his Kingdom overthrown, and the laſt and moſt effectual means were uſed for the recovery of Men out of his Snare and Power. When therefore he perceived that by all the grievous Perſecutions he raiſed againſt the Church it ſpread only ſo much the faſter, that at laſt the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatry fell down before the Croſs of Chriſt; when he was ſhamefully expelled out of his Temples, and from his Altars, his Oracles ſilenced, and the Religion of Jeſus prevailed every where; he then betook himſelf to his old Serpentine Arts of diſſimulation. Since he could no longer oppoſe Chriſt's Kingdom by open War, he reſolved to turn Chriſtian, and to ſet up for Chriſt's Deputy, and ſubſtitute here on Earth, to fight againſt Chriſtians under Chriſt's Banner, and by adulterating and corrupting the Chriſtian Doctrine, to ſpoil it of all its Efficacy, to introduce his old Heathen Rites and Idolatrous Ceremonies, as unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions from Chriſt himſelf or his Apoſtles, and ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:295"/> under his Name and pretended Authority to exerciſe all that cruelty, oppreſſion, and fraud, which is ſo pleaſing to his own infernal Nature, hoping to burn, deſtroy, root out all true Chriſtians from the face of the Earth, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of propagating the Catholick Faith, and enlarging Chriſt's Kingdom in the World.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> had long groaned under this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tyranny, it pleaſed God in many places of <hi>Europe,</hi> but eſpecially here in <hi>England,</hi> to ſet on foot a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, which was happily and peaceably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed among us by the favour and countenance of publick Authority and the wiſe Counſel and Advice of our Reverend Biſhops and other Miniſters. To nip this in the Bud, the Devil raiſed that ſharp Perſecution in Qu. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, in which our firſt Reformers gloriouſly ſealed what they had done with their Blood: but this proving ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, that he might the better fruſtrate the ends of our Reformation, himſelf would turn Reformer too; A great Cry was ſoon raiſed againſt our Church, as not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged from Popery, our Biſhops, our Prayers, our Ceremonies were all Antichriſtian, and it was not long before all Miniſters, Tythes, Temples, and the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties too, were condemned as ſuch; and God knows they had well nigh reformed away all Learning, true Religion, and Worſhip of God, and under the ſpecious Pretence of paring off all Superfluities, had grievouſly ſhaken the Foundations of Chriſtianity it ſelf; inſomuch, that it came to paſs, as ſome of thoſe who now diſſent from us did then complain, That <hi>Profeſſors of Religion did openly oppoſe and deride almost all that Service of God out of Conſcience, which other Men uſed to do out of Prophaneneſs.</hi> And what infinite miſchief this raſh and intemperate Zeal for reforming Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Corruptions hath done to our Church and Nation, if the Experience of this laſt Age will not ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men, it is not to be hoped that any Diſcourſe ſhould.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:295"/> We little conſider whoſe Intereſt we thus ſerve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote: we do his work who is moſt delighted with Strife and Confuſion, and every one can tell who that is, and where he reigns. To be ſure by theſe uncharitable Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations we highly gratifie the common Enemy, whoſe great Deſign and Policy it hath all along been, by the Follies and invincible Scruples of Proteſtant Diſſenters to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and by degrees pull down the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and then we all become an eaſie Prey to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If any now tell me, that to prevent this great Miſchief and Danger that ariſeth from our Diviſions, it is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the People ſhould lay down their Scruples, (which they cannot well do, ſince no one can at any time think or believe as he will) as it is that the Impoſitions themſelves, the Matters ſcrupled at, ſhould be removed and taken away, and then Peace and Unity may be better ſecured. To this I only anſwer theſe two things:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I now conſider things as they at preſent ſtand amongſt us. We have a Church ſetled and eſtabliſhed by Law, in which nothing that is ſinful is enjoyned. What the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Governours and Superiours is, how far they may or ought to condeſcend to the Weakneſs or Scruples of others, I ſhall not take upon me to determine; that is another Queſtion which belongs not to us. But I conſider now only what private Members of ſuch a Church are to do, and then I ſay, ſcrupling the Uſe of ſome things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Church, will not juſtifie our leaving it; nay, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards, it is our beſt and ſafeſt courſe to ſubmit and comply with ſuch Orders, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our Scruples. But I add,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If this were a ſufficient Reaſon why the Conſtitution of any Church ſhould be altered, becauſe ſome things are ſcrupled in it, there never could be a ſetled Church as long as the World ſtands; for, ſince there will be always a difference in Mens Underſtandings and Tempers, ſome
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:296"/> weak and injudicious, others peeviſh and proud, there will conſequently be many that ſhall ſcruple and be offended at the beſt and moſt innocnt Conſtitutions. And if the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies now in uſe amongſt us had not been retained at our firſt Reformation, thoſe very Perſons, who are now ſo much diſſatisfied with the Impoſition of them, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been the firſt that ſhould have then complained of the want of them. Of which we have this notorious and undeniable Evidence in the late times, when our Church was laid in the Duſt, when none of thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Forms which are now objected againſt were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or commonly uſed, yet even then were men gathering Congregations out of Congregations, purifying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſtill further; Scruples encreaſed, Sects and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon them multiplied, and never ſuch Diſtractions and Confuſions in Religion as in thoſe days; and without the gift of Prophecy one may foretell, that if what is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally found fault with in our Church was now aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet thoſe that are given to Scruples would at leaſt in time find cavelling Objections againſt any Conſtitution that can be made. They are like Men given to ſue and go to Law. They never want ſome Pretence to diſturb them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Neighbours.</p>
                        <p>Men may talk of reconciling our Differences, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up our Breaches to their Lives end, and propound their ſeveral Projects, and frame their Models, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fine deſigns of Union and Accommodation, yet none of theſe will have any effect, or do any good, till Men learn Humility and Modeſty, and be contented to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by others in things indifferent, till Self-conceit and Pride be in ſome meaſure rooted out; and when this is effectually done, there will then be found but little need of any Alteration in the preſent Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>The foundation of our Peace and Agreement muſt be laid in the reforming our ſelves and our own Tempers.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:296"/> The way to unite us lieth not ſo much in amending the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eſtabliſhment, Government, Liturgy, endeavouring to add to it, or leave out of it, till all Parties amongſt us are ſatisfied, (which indeed can never be effected) as it doth conſiſt in our becoming more truly Chriſtian in our Lives and Tempers. They are our vicious Diſpoſitions, more than our different Apprehenſions, that keep us at ſuch a diſtance. Let the terms of Communion with the Church be what they will, yet as long as Men retain the ſame quarrelſom Mind, and induſtriouſly ſeek for Doubts and Scruples, and are glad to find them, and prefer their own private Opinion and Judgment before the Wiſdom and Authority of all their Governours, whether Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, it is plain our Diviſions and Animoſities will not, cannot ceaſe.</p>
                        <p>But this leads me to the laſt thing I deſign'd to diſcourſe of; which was, to propound to you the beſt ways and means by which men may get rid of and eaſe their Minds of ſuch Scruples; where I ſhall eſpecially conſider thoſe that relate to our communicating with our Pariſh-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. You muſt not expect that I ſhould deſcend to, and anſwer the particular Exceptions which hinder men from conſtant Communion with us; but only in general I ſhall crave leave to adviſe ſome few things, which would mightily tend to the removing thoſe Doubts and Scruples that yet detain ſo many in a ſtate of utter Separation from us, or at leaſt diſcourage their total and hearty joyning with us. Which charitable Deſign and Attempt, however unſucceſsful I may be in it, yet cannot, I hope, be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to any, whoſe Conſciences are peſter'd with ſuch Scruples, ſince I endeavour only to deliver them from thoſe Miſtakes, which beſide the diſſervice they do to Religion and the Proteſtant Intereſt, do alſo expoſe them to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and danger from the Publick Laws and Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Of many Rules that might be given in this caſe, I ſhall inſiſt only on theſe following.</p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:297"/>
                        <p n="1">1. We ſhould take great care to beget and cheriſh in our Minds the moſt high, and worthy, and honourable Thoughts of God Almighty. This is the Foundation of all Religion; and as our Apprehenſions of God are, ſuch for the moſt part will be his Worſhip and Service. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as we conceive of his Nature, ſo ſhall we judge what things are moſt pleaſing to him, as alſo what they are that are moſt offenſive and diſtaſtful to him.</p>
                        <p>Now conſider, I beſeech you, Can that Man have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and excellent Thoughts of the Divine Nature, who imagines that God regards any particular Geſtures, Habits, and Poſtures ſo far, as that the acceptance of our Service and Worſhip ſhould depend upon ſuch Circumſtances of our Religious Actions? When with all Humility and true devotion of Heart a ſincere Chriſtian proſtrates himſelf at the Throne of God's Grace, and with earneſt Deſire and Affections begs thoſe good things that are according to Gods Mind and Will, can we believe that the Father of our Spirits ſhall refuſe and reject his Petition becauſe it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a certain preſcribed form of Words? Shall his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate renewed Requeſts fail of Succeſs becauſe he ſtill uſeth the ſame Expreſſions, and reads his Prayers out of a Book? Is God pleaſed with variety of Words? or the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our Invention, or the elegancy of our Phraſe and Stile? Is it not the Heart and inward frame of Spirit that God principally reſpects in all our Prayers? Or can we think ſo meanly of God, that he ſhould ſhut his ears againſt the united Prayers of his People, becauſe offended at the colour of the Garment in which the Miniſter officiates?</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe two Perſons, both with equal Preparation, with true Repentance and Faith to approach the Lord's Table; one of them, out of a deep ſenſe of his Unworthineſs to receive ſo great Bleſſings, and out of a grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Benefits therein conferr'd upon him, takes the Sacrament upon his Knees, in the humbleſt Poſture; the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:297"/> other ſitting or ſtanding: can you think that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is effectual or beneficial, or that God bleſſes it only to him that ſits, or that it would not have been of the ſame advantage to him if he alſo had received it kneeling? To ſurmiſe any ſuch thing, is ſurely to diſhonour God, as if he were a low, poor, humourſome Being, like a Father that ſhould diſinherit his Child, tho in all Reſpects moſt duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and every way deſerving his greateſt Kindneſs, only becauſe he did not like his Complexion, or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his Hair. The wiſer and greater any Perſon is to whom we addreſs our ſelves, the leſs he will ſtand upon little Punctilio's.</p>
                        <p>Under the Jewiſh Law the minuteſt circumſtances of Worſhip were exactly deſcribed and determined by God himſelf, and it was not ordinarily lawful for the Prieſts at all to vary from them. But it was neceſſary then that it ſhould be thus; becauſe the Jewiſh Worſhip was typical of what was to come hereafter, and thoſe many nice Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances that were appointed were not commanded for themſelves, as if there were any Excellency in them, but they were ſhadows of things to come, which are all now done away by the Goſpel, and the bringing in of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs, the only thing always pleaſing to God, and agreeable to his Nature: It is a ſpiritual rational Service God now expects from us, and delights in; and he muſt look upon God as a very fond and captious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who can perſwade himſelf that our Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and other Acts of Worſhip, tho we be moſt hearty and devout in them, yet ſhall be rejected by him only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome particular Habits or Geſtures we uſed, which were neither diſhonourable to God, nor unſutable to the nature of thoſe religious Performances.</p>
                        <p>Such mean Thoughts of God are the true ground of all Superſtition, when we think to court and pleaſe him by making great Conſcience about little things; and ſo it hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:298"/> been truly obſerved, that there is far more Superſtition in conſcientious abſtaining from that which God hath no where forbid, than there is in doing that which God hath not commanded. A man may certainly do what God hath not commanded, and yet never think to flatter God by it, nor place any Religion in it, but he may do it only out of obedience to his Superiours, for outward Order and Decency, for which end our Ceremonies are appointed, and ſo there is no Superſtition in them. But now a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not out of Conſcience refuſe to do what God hath not forbid, and is by lawful Authority required of him, but he muſt think to pleaſe God by ſuch abſtaining: and in this conceit of pleaſing or humouring God by indifferent things, conſiſts the true Spirit of Superſtition.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Lay out your great care and zeal about the neceſſary and ſubſtantial duties of Religion, and this will make you leſs concerned about things of an inferiour and indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As on the one hand our fierce Diſputes and Debates about little things and circumſtances are apt to eat out the Heart and Life of Religion, ſo on the other ſide, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things moſt, in which the Power of Religion doth conſiſt, is the beſt way to cure our Scrupulouſneſs about little things. This was the Apoſtle's Advice to the <hi>Romans, cap.</hi> 14. amongſt whom eating or not eating ſome Meats, obſerving or not obſerving ſome days, had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as much Trouble and Scruple as Forms of Prayer and Ceremonies do now amongſt us, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is not Meat or Drink, but Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> What needs all this Stir and Buſtle? This cenſuring, diſputing, and dividing about Standing or Kneeling, theſe are not the great matters of our Faith; they are not worth ſo much Noiſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The great ſtreſs and weight in our Religion is laid upon the Duties of a righteous and holy Life, and a peaceable Spirit and Converſation, and then he adds,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:298"/> 
                           <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>For he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God and approved of Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus when you betake your ſelves to your Prayers, let it be your greateſt care to fix in your Minds a due ſenſe of God's Infinite Majeſty, of your own Vileneſs and Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, of your manifold Wants and Neceſſities, and the greatneſs and goodneſs of the things you petition for, and his readineſs to grant them upon your humble Requeſt; and the more you do this, the leſs ſollicitous you will be about the form or words of your Prayers. He that minds thoſe things moſt on which the efficacy of his Prayers for Chriſt's ſake doth depend, will not ſtand in need of, nor require new Phraſes every time to ſtir his Attention or to raiſe his Affection. Thus let Men be very diligent and conſcientious in preparing themſelves for the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; let them come thereunto with lively Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Chriſt's Love in dying for us, with hearty Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Amendment, and true Charity towards all Men; the more concerned they are about theſe neceſſary things, the leſs afraid will they be of offending God by kneeling at the Adminiſtration, or coming up to receive it in one part of the Church rather than another: for, they will find that they are quite other things in which true Religion conſiſts, in a new Nature, in a divine temper of Mind, in the conſtant Practiſe of Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; which make a Man really better, and more like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
                        <p>He that places any Religion in not putting off his Hat, or ſitting at the Sacrament, or not ſtanding up at the Creed or Goſpel, as I before ſhew'd you, hath no worthy Thoughts of God; ſo neither hath he any right Notion of Chriſtianity, which conſiſts only in unfeigned Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and ſincere Love to our Brother, not in any external Rites or Obſervances, which are in their own Nature variable and mutable, and are different in ſeveral Churches.</p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:299"/>
                        <p n="3">3. It would greatly contribute to the removing theſe Scruples which hinder the bleſſed Union of Chriſtians amongſt us, if men were but really willing to receive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. This alone would go half way towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering them. But when they are grown fond of and nouriſh their Doubts and Prejudices, and converſe only with thoſe Men, read only thoſe Books, and hear thoſe Diſcourſes which are made of their ſide, which ſerve to heighten and ſtrengthen their Jealouſies and Suſpicions, when they avoid the means of Conviction as dangerous Snares and Temptations, and look upon this tenderneſs or aptneſs to be offended, as a ſign of Grace and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſcientiouſneſs, there can be but little hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſuch Perſons to a right apprehenſion of things. Whereas would they come once to diſtruſt their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſuppoſe that they may perhaps be all this while miſtaken, would they calmly and patiently hear, faithfully and impartially conſider what is ſaid or wrote againſt them, as eagerly deſire and ſeek for ſatisfaction, as Men do for cure of any Diſeaſe they are ſubject unto; would they, I ſay, thus diligently uſe all fit means and helps for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of their Scruples, before they troubled the Church of Chriſt with them, it would not prove ſo very difficult a Task to convince and ſettle ſuch teachable Minds.</p>
                        <p>If therefore any Man be poſſeſſed with Doubts or Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt any thing practiſed or required in our Church, let him firſt read ſome of thoſe excellent Books, that are written with all the fairneſs and evidence imaginable, on purpoſe to explain and juſtifie thoſe things that are moſt uſually excepted againſt; let him conſult with ſome of our Church before he leaves it. Let him honeſtly repair to the Miniſter of his Pariſh, or ſome other whom he hath in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtimation, and ingenuouſly open his Mind to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what it is he moſt ſtumbles at, and hear what can be offered for the Reſolution of his Doubts. If conſulting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:299"/> with one Perſon will not do it, let him adviſe with others, and try this often, before he condemns us, and divides from us. Would Men do this ſeriouſly, with earneſt deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, without doubt we ſhould have far fewer Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and they who after this did ſtill diſſent from us, would be far more excuſable in it, than otherwiſe they are, and this is no other than what men ordinarily do in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affairs. When they have any fear or ſuſpition about their worldly concerns, they preſently repair to thoſe who are beſt skill'd, and moſt able to reſolve them, and in their judgment and determination they commonly acquieſce and ſatisfie themſelves. Hath any man a ſcruple about his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, whether it be firmly ſetled, or he hath a true legal Title to it? The way he takes for ſatisfaction is to adviſe with Lawyers, the moſt eminent for Knowledge and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in their Profeſſion. If they agree in the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is the greateſt aſſurance he can have that it is right and ſafe. Thus is it with one that doubts whether ſuch a cuſtom or practiſe be for his Health, the opinion of known and experienced Phyſicians is the only proper means to determine him in ſuch a Caſe. The reaſon is the ſame here. When any private Chriſtian is troubled and perplexed with fears and ſcruples that concern his Duty, or the Worſhip of God, he ought in the firſt place to have recourſe to the Publick Guides and Miniſters of Religion, who are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and are beſt fitted to direct and conduct him; I ſay, to come to them, not only to diſpute and argue with them, and pertly to oppoſe them, but with all modeſty to propound their doubts, meekly to hearken to and receive Inſtruction, humbly begging of God to open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings that they may ſee and embrace the truth, taking great care that no evil affection, love of a Party, or carnal intereſt influence or byaſs their Judgments.</p>
                        <p>We do not by this deſire men to pin their faith upon the Prieſts Sleeve, or to put out their own Eyes that they might
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:300"/> be better guided and managed by them; but only diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend to their Reaſons and Arguments, and to give ſome due regard and deference to their Authority: for it is not ſo abſurd, as may by ſome be imagined, for the Common People to take upon truſt from their lawful Teachers, what they are not competent Judges of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>But the difficulty here is, how ſhall a private Chriſtian govern himſelf, when the very Guides and Miniſters of Religion determine differently concerning theſe matters in queſtion amongſt us? Some warranting and allowing them, others as much diſapproving and condemning them: by what Rule ſhall he chooſe his Guide? To which I briefly reply;</p>
                        <p>1. As for thoſe who ſcruple at Conformity, and are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably able to judge for themſelves, let not ſuch relye barely upon the Authority either of the one or the other. All we deſire of them is, that they would equally hear both ſides, that they would think that the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have ſome Senſe and Conſcience too as well as other Men, and are able to ſay ſomewhat for what they do themſelves, or require of others; that laying aſide all Prejudices, Favour to or admiration of Mens Perſons, they would weigh and conſider the Arguments that may be propounded to them, being diffident of their own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and indifferent to either part of the Queſtion; that they would think it no ſhame to change their Mind when they ſee good reaſon for it. Could we thus prevail with the People diligently to examine the Merits of the cauſe, our Church would every day gain more Ground amongſt all wiſe Men: for we care not how much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding our People have, ſo they be but humble and modeſt with it, nor do we deſire Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Proſelytes any further than we give them good Scripture and Reaſon for it.</p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:300"/>
                        <p>2. But as for thoſe who are not ſo capable of examining or judging for themſelves (as few of the common People who ſeparate from us really are; they not being able to give any tolerable account of their diſſent from us, only in general Words declaiming againſt Popery, Superſtition, Antichriſtian and Unſcriptural Ceremonies, Humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> ſuch had better truſt to and depend on thoſe Miniſters, of known Sufficiency for their Office, who are regularly and by the Laws of the Land ſet over them, than any other Guides or Teachers that they can chooſe for themſelves. This to be ſure is the ſafer courſe, which in doubtful caſes is always to be taken. I ſpeak now of theſe preſent Controverſies about Forms and Ceremonies ſo hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated amongſt us, which are above the Sphere of common People, out of their profeſſion; not of ſuch things as concern the Salvation of all men, which are plain and evident to the meaneſt Capacities. When therefore in ſuch caſes, about which we cannot eaſily ſatisfie our ſelves, we follow the Advice of the publickly authorized Guides and Preachers of Religion, if they chance to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead us, we have ſomething to ſay or apologize for our ſelves. Our Error is more excuſable and pardonable, as being occaſion'd by thoſe, to whoſe Judgment, by God's Command, we did owe a great Reſpect and Submiſſion. But when we chooſe Inſtructors and Counſellors to our ſelves according to our own Fancy and liking, and they teach us contrary to the Doctrine of our lawful Miniſters, if then we prove to be in the wrong, and are betray'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin, we may thank our own Wantonneſs for it, and are more ſeverely accomptable for ſuch Miſtakes.</p>
                        <p>Thus let a Man that is troubled with any threatning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, apply himſelf rather to the Licenſed Phyſicians or Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions, of approved Skill and Honeſty; and if he chance to miſcarry under them, yet he hath this contentment, that he uſed the beſt and wiſeſt means for his Health and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:301"/> But if he leaves them all, and will hearken only to <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Empiricks,</hi> tho they adviſe him quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what the others preſcribed, if under their hands he grows worſe and worſe, he muſt then charge his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Folly or idle Humour, as the cauſe of his Ruine.</p>
                        <p>4. In order to the curing of our Scruples, we ſhould thoroughly underſtand and conſider, what is the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lawful, and how it differs from what is neceſſary, and from what is ſinful. That is neceſſary or our Duty which God hath expreſly commanded, that is ſinful which God hath forbid; that is lawful which God hath not by any Law obliging us either commanded or forbid: for, <hi>Where there is no Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, Rom.</hi> 4. 15. There can be no Tranſgreſſion, but either omitting what the Law commands, or doing what the Law forbids. For inſtance, If any Man can ſhew where kneeling at the Sacrament is forbid in Scripture, where fitting is required; where praying by a Form is forbid, and extemporary Prayers are enjoyned, then indeed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute would ſoon be at an end: but if neither the one nor the other can be found, as moſt certainly they cannot, then kneeling at the Sacrament, and reading Prayers out of a Book, muſt be reckon'd amongſt things lawful. And then there is no need of ſcrupling them, becauſe they may be done without Sin: nay, where they are required by our Superiours, it is our Duty to ſubmit to them, becauſe it is our Duty to obey them in all lawful things.</p>
                        <p>This way of arguing is very plain and convincing, and cannot be evaded but by giving another Notion of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And therefore it is commonly ſaid, that nothing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, eſpecially in the Worſhip of God, which God himſelf hath not preſcribed and appointed, or that hath been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to evil Purpoſes. And on theſe two Miſtakes are chiefly grounded Mens Scruples about indifferent Rites and Ceremonies in God's Worſhip.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:301"/>
                        <p>1. That only is ſaid to be lawful in God's Worſhip which he himſelf hath preſcribed and appointed; ſo that this is thought Exception ſufficient againſt the Forms and Uſages of our Church, that though they are not forbid, yet they are no where commanded in Scripture. <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now here I only ask, Where our Saviour or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have forbid us doing any thing in God's Worſhip, which is not by himſelf commanded, or where in the New Teſtament we are told, that God will be angry with us for doing any thing which he hath no where forbid, either by general or particular Laws? For unleſs this can be ſhewn, there can be no colour for this Pretence, and we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſure, that no ſuch Place can be produced out of the Bible. It is acknowledged by all, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to all that is neceſſary to be believed or done in order to Salvation, as to all the eſſential and ſubſtantial Parts of Divine Worſhip, is a plain and perfect Rule; but it is as certain, that the outward Circumſtances of Time, Place, Habit, and Geſture, are not determined in the New Teſtament, as they were in many caſes by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: and yet God cannot be, at leaſt viſibly and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, worſhipped without them. If therefore theſe be not determined in Scripture, and it is unlawful to do any thing in God's Worſhip but what is ſo determined, it follows that God cannot be worſhipped at all, unleſs we could worſhip him in no Time, Place, Habit, or Geſture: nor indeed can I learn how a Chriſtian can, with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, perform any part of God's Worſhip, if this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple be admitted for true, that whatſoever is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is forbid, ſince the external Circumſtances of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Actions, without which they cannot be performed, are not preſcribed or determined in Scripture; and ſo he muſt commit a Sin every time he prays or receives the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament.</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:302"/>
                        <p>Beſides, this Reaſon would oblige us to ſeparate from all the Churches that ever were or are in the World, there being no conſtituted Church in which there are not ſome Orders and Injunctions for the regulating the publick Worſhip of God no where commanded in Scripture. We could never, upon this Principle, have held Communion with the Primitive Churches, which undoubtedly had their inſtituted ſignificant Ceremonies; nor is there any Church at this day, that hath not by its own Authority determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome of the Circumſtances of Divine Service for the more decent and orderly Performance thereof. Nay, thoſe very Perſons that make this Exception, do themſelves practiſe many things in the Worſhip of God, without the leaſt ſhadow of a Divine Command, to which they oblige their Hearers and Communicants: for, conceived Prayers, ſitting at the Euchariſt, ſprinkling the Infant at Baptiſm, the Miniſter's officiating in a black Cloak or Coat, are full out as unſcriptural, humane, uncommanded, as any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, Habit, or Form uſed in our Church.</p>
                        <p>2. That is ſaid to be unlawful which hath been abuſed to ſinful Purpoſes, to Idolatry or Superſtition; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be retained in our Worſhip, tho it be not forbid by God, which was uſed in times of Popery. Hence the ordinary Objection againſt our Pariſh Churches is, that they are not ſufficiently purged from Popery; that our firſt Reformers were indeed excellent and worthy Perſons for the Times they lived in; that what they did was very commendable and a good Beginning, but they were forced to comply with the neceſſities of the Age, which would not bear a compleat Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They left a great deal of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Traſh in the Church, hoping by degrees to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Papiſts to it, or at leaſt, that they might not make the Breach too wide, and too much prejudice or eſtrange them from it. But we now live under better means, have greater Light and Knowledge, and ſo a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:302"/> and more perfect Amendment is now neceſſary. Thus the Order of Biſhops is decried as Popiſh and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, our Liturgy as taken out of the Maſs Book, and our Ceremonies as Relicks of Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>But the truth of the caſe is this. We muſt conſider, that thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do hold and maintain all the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, but then by degrees, as they found Opportunity, they have added a number of impious and pernicious Doctrines to the Chriſtian Faith, the Belief and Profeſſion of which they equally require of all that are in their Communion. Beſides this, they have introduced ſeveral idolatrous, and ſuperſtitious Rites and Practiſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Service of their Church, never heard of for the firſt four hundred Years, by which they have miſerably defaced and corrupted the Worſhip of God, and made it neceſſary for all thoſe that love their own Salvation, to ſeparate from them. Now our firſt Reformers here in <hi>England</hi> did not go about to invent a new Species of Government, to deviſe new Rites and Ceremonies and a new form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuch as ſhould be leaſt excepted againſt, and then obtrude it upon this Nation, as was done at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſome other places; but they wiſely conſidered, that if they did but reject what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> had added to the Faith and Worſhip of Chriſtians, lay aſide their novel Inventions, Uſurpations, and unwritten Traditions, there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the pure, ſimple, Primitive Chriſtianity, ſuch as it was before the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was thus degenerated: nor have we any thing of Popery left amongſt us, but what the Papiſts had left amongſt them of Primitive Religion and Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>As we muſt not receive the evil for the ſake of the good, ſo neither muſt we reject the good for the ſake of the evil. In our Church we pray neither to Saints nor Angels, nor the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> our Liturgy is in a known Tongue, we deny the Laity no part of the Sacrament, nor the reading of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:303"/> the Scriptures, we offer no Maſs Sacrifice, nor Worſhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or the conſecrated Bread. We have not one Doctrine or Ceremony in uſe amongſt us, that is purely Popiſh. But we muſt be obliged to part with the moſt ſacred, venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uſefulleſt things in our Religion, if this be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon of our forbearing any thing, becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts abuſe it.</p>
                        <p>This therefore I conclude to be the beſt and plaineſt rule for the governing of our Conſciences, not wilfully to omit any thing that God hath commanded, to avoid to the utmoſt of our Power what God hath forbid; and what ever elſe we have no particular Divine Law about, to guide our ſelves by the general Rules of Scripture, the commands of our Superiours, and by the meaſures of Prudence, Peace, and Charity. This one rule (and it cannot but ſeem a very reaſonable one) would ſoon put an end to our ſquabbles and janglings about Forms and Ceremonies and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things.</p>
                        <p>5. In order to the bringing men to a complyance with the Laws of our Church, we muſt deſire them to conſider that there never was nor ever will be any publick Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that will be every way unexceptionable. The beſt policy, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, that can be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed will have ſome flaws and defects, which muſt be borne and tolerated. Some Inconveniences will in proceſs of time ariſe, that never could be foreſeen or provided againſt; and to make alteration upon every emergent diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty may be often of worſe conſequence, than the evil we pretend to cure by it. Let the Rules and Modes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſcipline, publick Worſhip, be moſt exact and blameleſs, yet there will be faults in Governours and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as long as they are but men. We muſt not expect in this World a Church without Spot or Wrinkle, that conſiſts only of Saints, in which nothing can be found amiſs; eſpecially by thoſe who lye at the catch and wait for an advantage againſt it.</p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:303"/>
                        <p>If men will ſcruple and reform, as long as any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth which they can object againſt, they muſt e'en come at laſt, as a Reverend Perſon of our Church hath obſerved, to the ſtate of that miſerable Man who left all humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that he might not be defiled with other Mens Sins, and at laſt cut out the Contents of Chapters and Titles of Books out of the Bible, becauſe they were humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions added to the pure Word of God. Men muſt be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if ever they would promote Peace and Unity, to put candid Conſtructions and favourable Interpretations upon things, to take them by the beſt handle, and not ſtrain things on purpoſe that they might cavil the more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and raiſe more conſiderable Objections againſt them. We muſt not make perſonal, accidental Faults, nor any thing a pretence for our leaving the Communion of our Church, which ariſeth only from the neceſſary condition and temper of all humane Affairs, that nothing here is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect.</p>
                        <p>6. And laſtly, if you cannot by theſe, and other the like conſiderations, not now to be mentioned, get rid of, and conquer your Scruples, then be adviſed to lay them aſide, to throw them out of your Minds as dangerous Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and act poſitively againſt them.</p>
                        <p>But here I eaſily imagine ſome ready preſently to ask me, Do you perſwade us to conform to the Orders of the Church tho we are not ſatisfied in our Minds concerning them? I anſwer, That I think this the beſt Advice that can be given to ſuch ſcrupulous Perſons. It would be an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infinite thing, and Communion with any Church would be altogether unpracticable, if every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian was obliged to ſuſpend joyning himſelf to it, till he was perfectly ſatisfied about the reaſonableneſs and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of all that was required, or was in uſe in that Church: for indeed, private Perſons are by no means proper Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of what is fit and convenient in the Adminiſtration of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:304"/> Church-Government, Diſcipline, or publick Worſhip, no more than they are of matters of State, or the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all Civil Laws. Common People generally have neither Patience to conſider, nor Judgment to weigh all Circumſtances, nor Wiſdom to chooſe that which is beſt; theſe things of a Publick Nature belong only to our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours and Governours, and if they appoint what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, indecent, or inconvenient, they only are accountable for it. It is not the fault of thoſe that joyn with ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or yield to ſuch Injunctions (not plainly ſinful) for the ſake of Peace and Order.</p>
                        <p>I know therefore no better Rule for the directing and quieting Mens Conſciences than this, that as to all ſuch Matters as relate to Publick Order and decent Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Worſhip, they ſhould without any ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Fearfulneſs comply with the Cuſtoms of the Church they live in, never troubling themſelves, nor curiouſly examining what is beſt and fitteſt, as long as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing enjoyned or done, which (after due enquiry) appears to us contrary to any Law of God. Thus St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us in that often quoted place, where he tells us, <hi>He knew no better courſe for a ſerious prudent Chriſtian to take, in matters of Rites and Cuſtoms, than to follow the Churches Example where he is: for whatſoever is preſcribed neither againſt Faith or Manners, is a matter in its ſelf indifferent, and to be obſerved according to the Cuſtom of thoſe he lives among.</hi> This was agreeable to the Counſel St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> gave him when he was ſent by his Mother to enquire his Judgment about the Saturday Faſt, <hi>When I am at Rome,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop, <hi>I fast on the Sabbath, but at</hi> Milan <hi>I do not. So thou likewiſe, when thou comeſt to any Church, obſerve its Cuſtom, if thou wouldeſt neither be an offence to them, nor have them be ſo to thee.</hi> Which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> ever after looked upon as an <hi>Oracle from Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:304"/>
                        <p>I do not by this encourage Men to venture blindfold on Sin, or to neglect any reaſonable care of their Actions; but if People raiſe all the Difficulties and Objections they can ſtart, before they proceed to a Reſolution about things that have no manifeſt Impiety in them, nor are plainly nor by any eaſie conſequence, contrary to the revealed Will of God, this cannot but occaſion infinite Perplexity and Trouble to Mens Minds, and there are but few things they ſhall be able to do with a ſafe and quiet Conſcience. Should all thoſe that have ſome little Arguments againſt the Sign of the Croſs, puzzle themſelves with the Objections uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally urged againſt Infant Baptiſm, and defer baptizing their Children till they were fully ſatisfied about it, I doubt not but the baptizing of Infants would ſoon be as much ſcrupled at as the croſſing them now is. But there is no apparent Evil in it; it is the Practiſe of the Church we live in, it is no where forbid in Scripture: this ordinarily is ſufficient Warrant for what we do.</p>
                        <p>Before we ſeparate from a Church, or refuſe to comply with its Orders, we ought to be fully ſatisfied and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the Unlawfulneſs of what is required, that it is forbid by God; becauſe by leaving the Communion of any Church, we paſs Sentence upon and condemn it, which ought not to be done upon light and doubtful cauſes: but there is not the ſame neceſſity that we ſhould be thus ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied about our Conformity to all things preſcribed by the Church. We may preſume them to be innocent, unleſs they plainly appear to us otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>The Judicious and Learned Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it in his fourth Sermon <hi>Ad Clerum, The Law taketh every Man for a good Man and true, till his Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty be legally diſproved: and as our Saviour ſometimes ſaid, He that is not againſt us is for us: ſo in theſe matters (he ſpeaks of thoſe Ceremonies that for Order's ſake, and to add the greater Solemnity to ſacred Actions, are appointed in the</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:305"/> 
                           <hi>Church) we are to believe all things to be lawful for us to do, which cannot be ſhewn by good Evidence either of Scripture or Reaſon to be unlawful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If any one be afraid that this Principle once imbibed would introduce Popery, make People greedily ſwallow, and without any Examination ſubmit to every thing their Superiours pleaſe to impoſe upon them, let him only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (which we all agree in) that there are many things in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Worſhip and Religion manifeſtly evil, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the revealed Will of God, which renders our Separation from them neceſſary, and ſo conſequently juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable: whereas the things objected againſt in our Church are at worſt only doubtful and ſuſpicious, or rather not ſo good and expedient as might be deviſed: and this ſurely makes a wide difference in the caſe.</p>
                        <p>But doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>I know and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf, but to him that eſteemeth any thing unclean it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean?</hi> Doth not he expreſly tell us, <hi>That whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin?</hi> that is, Whatever we do without a full Perſuaſion of the lawfulneſs of it, tho it be not ſo in it ſelf, yet is a Sin in him that doth it againſt his Conſcience. And doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat,</hi> before he is convinced that it may be done? I deſire here therefore only to be rightly underſtood, and then theſe things are ſoon reconciled.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When I ſpeak of a Scrupulous Conſcience, I ſuppoſe the Perſon tolerably well perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of what is to be done, but yet he doth not like or approve of it, he hath ſome little Reaſons and Exceptions againſt it, it is not the beſt and fitteſt, all things conſidered. This is properly a Scruple, and is certainly the caſe of all thoſe, who do ſometimes (to ſave themſelves from the ſeverity of the Laws) joyn in our Worſhip, and communicate with us; which we preſume they would never do did they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:305"/> judge it abſolutely ſinful and forbidden by God. So that though it ſhould be granted that a man cannot innocently do that of which his Conſcience doubts whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or not, yet a Man may, and in ſome caſes is bound to do that which is not unlawful, though upon ſome other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts he ſcruples the doing of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the Queſtion be about things wherein we are left wholly to our ſelves, and at Liberty, having no very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Reaſon for the doing of them, then it may be the ſafeſt way to forbear all ſuch things we ſcruple at. Of ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the fore-mentioned Places, of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not eating ſome Meats; neither of them was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any Law. Eating was no inſtance of Duty, nor was it any ways forbid Chriſtians: where to do or not to do is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at our own choice, it is beſt for a Man to forbear doing that of which he hath ſome ſuſpicion, tho he be not ſure that it is ſinful. As ſuppoſe a man have Scruples in his Mind about playing at Cards and Dice, or going to ſee Stage-Plays, or putting out his Money to Uſury, becauſe there is no great Reaſon or Neceſſity for any of theſe things, and to be ſure they may be innocently forborn without any Detriment to our ſelves or others; though we do not judge them abſolutely ſinful, yet it is ſafeſt for him who cannot ſatisfie himſelf concerning the Goodneſs and Fitneſs of them, wholly to deny himſelf the uſe of them. But in theſe two caſes it is moſt for the quiet of our Conſciences, to act againſt or notwithſtanding our Fears and Scruples, when either our Superiours, to whom we owe Obedience, have interpoſed their Commands, or when by it we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome great Evil or Miſchief.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When our Superiours, either Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, whom by the Will of God we are bound to obey in all lawful things, have interpoſed their Commands, our Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will not excuſe or juſtifie our Diſobedience. If indeed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:306"/> we judge what is commanded to be abſolutely unlawful, tho it be a falſe erroneous Judgment, yet whilſt we are under ſuch perſuaſion we are by no means to do it upon any Inducement whatever.</p>
                        <p>If I only doubt of the lawfulneſs of any particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it be an inſtance wherein I am at liberty, I am ſtill bound not to do it. For, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin.</hi> I am certainly innocent when I forbear; I may commit a Sin, If I do it, Wiſdom would therefore, that the ſafer part be choſen. But now if I am by the command of my Superiours obliged to it, my choice is then determined, it then becomes my Duty, and it can never be ſafe or adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to neglect a plain Duty for an uncertain Offence. Thus moſt and beſt <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> do determine about a doubtful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, particularly the forenamed reverend Biſhop, in the ſame Sermon, <hi>Whatſoever is commanded us by thoſe whom God hath ſet over us, either in Church, Commonwealth, or Family</hi> (quod tamen not ſit certum diſplicere Deo, <hi>ſaith St.</hi> Bernard) <hi>which is not evidently contrary to the Law and Will of God, ought to be of us received and obeyed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as if God himſelf had commanded it, becauſe God himſelf hath commanded us to obey the Higher Powers, and to ſubmit our ſelves to their Ordinances.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But now this is more plain concerning Fears and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples only about the conveniency and expediency of things, theſe ought all to be deſpiſed when they come in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the Duty of Obedience. Would men but think themſelves in Conſcience bound to pay the ſame Duty and reſpect to the Judgment and Authority of Magiſtrates and Governours, whether in Church or State, as they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their Servants and Children ſhould to themſelves, they would ſoon ſee the reaſonableneſs of ſuch ſubmiſſion. For all Government and Subjection would be very precarious and arbitrary, if every one that did not approve of a Law
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:306"/> or was not fully ſatisfied about the reaſonableneſs of it, was thereby exempted from all Obligations to obey it. This is to give the Supreme Authority to the moſt humourſome or perverſe ſort of Chriſtians: for, according to this principle, no publick Laws and Conſtitutions can be valid and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs every ſcrupulous, tho a very ignorant Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, conſent to them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We are not to mind or ſtand upon our Scruples, when they probably occaſion a great evil, a general miſchief. They are not fit to be put in the balance with the Peace of the Church and Unity of Chriſtians. Suppoſe for once that our publick way of Worſhip is not the beſt that can be deviſed, that many things might be amended in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, that we could invent a more agreeable Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than this preſent is (which yet no man in the World can ever tell, for we cannot know all the inconveniences of any Alteration, till it comes to be tryed) yet granting all this, it cannot be thought ſo intolerable an Evil as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God's Solemn Worſhip, dividing into Sects and Parties, living in Debate, Contention, and Separation from one another. If there be ſome Rites and Cuſtoms amongſt us not wiſely choſen or determined, ſome Ceremonies againſt which juſt Exceptions may be made, yet to forſake the Communion of ſuch a true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſet up a diſtinct Altar in oppoſition to it, to combine and aſſociate into ſeparate Congregations, is (as it is ſomewhere expreſſed) <hi>like knocking a man on the head becauſe his Teeth are rotten, or his Nails too long.</hi> How much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is it to the Chriſtian Temper, to be willing to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice all ſuch Doubts and Scruples to the Intereſts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order and divine Charity; for better ſurely it is to ſerve God in a defective imperfect manner, to bear with many Diſorders and Faults, than to break the Bond of Peace and brotherly Communion.</p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:307"/>
                        <p>For this we have the Example of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour, who lived and died in Communion with a Church where there were far greater Corruptions both as to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Practiſes, than can be pretended to be in ours at this day; yet though he was the great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of Mankind, he forſook not the Jewiſh Church, but aſſembled with them in their publick Synagogues, which anſwer to our Pariſh-Churches, preached in the Temple though they had made it a Den of Thieves, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their Feſtivals, tho ſome of them of humane Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, nay commanded his Diſciples to continue to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> tho they were a moſt vile and wretched Generation of Men. Great were the Pollutions and Miſdemeanours in the Churches of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> yet no one Member of them is ever commanded to come out or ſeparate from thoſe Churches to joyn in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Congregation or to avoid mixt Communions, or for better Edification. For Men to be drunk at the Sacrament was certainly a worſe Fault than to kneel at it, or for a wicked Man to intrude himſelf; yet the Apoſtle doth not adviſe any to withdraw from that Church, but only eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to examine himſelf. We ought to do all that we can do without Sin, ſubmit to an hundred things which are againſt our Mind or we had rather let alone, for the ſake of Peace and Unity, ſo deſirable in it ſelf, ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Glory of God, the Honour of Religion, for our common Intereſt and Safety, for the Preſervation of what I may, without Vanity, call the beſt Church in the World.</p>
                        <p>I cannot ſtand now to tell you, how earneſtly this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of maintaining Unity amongſt Chriſtians is preſſed in the New Teſtament; how concerned our Bleſſed Maſter was, that all his Diſciples ſhould agree together and live as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; how ſeverely the Holy Apoſtles chid and rebuked
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:307"/> thoſe that cauſed Diviſions and Strife amongſt Chriſtians, reckoning Schiſm and Contention amongſt the moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and dangerous Sins. It ſhould make both the Ears (one would think) of ſome amongſt us to tingle, but to hear what Senſe the Primitive Chriſtians had of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſeparating from and breaking the Communion of Chriſtians, nay, what the old Non-conformiſts here in <hi>England</hi> have ſaid of it, yet remaining in Print, charging the People to be as tender of Church-Diviſion as they were of Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, or any other enormous Crime. And did Men know and conſider the evil of Schiſm, they would not be ſo ready, upon every ſlight occaſion, to ſplit upon that Rock.</p>
                        <p>Let us therefore divert our Fears and Scruples upon greater Sins. It is far more certain, that cauſleſs Separation from the Communion of Chriſtians is ſinful, than that Kneeling at the Sacrament, or Praying by a Book, is ſuch. Why then have Men ſuch invincible Scruples about one, and none at all about the other? They run headlong into the Separate Aſſemblies, which ſurely are more like to Schiſmatical Conventicles than any thing in our Church is to Idolatry. Let Men be as ſcrupulous and fearful of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt the Chriſtian Laws of Subjection, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and Charity, as they are of worſhipping God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an impure manner, and this alone will contribute much to the making up thoſe Breaches which threaten ſudden Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine to our Church and Nation. I only add here, that in all that I have now ſaid I am not conſcious to my ſelf, that I have uſed any Argument or affirmed any thing, but what many of thoſe very Miniſters, who now diſſent from us, did teach, and maintain, and print too, againſt the <hi>Independents</hi> and other Sectaries that divided from them when they preached in the Pariſh-Churches. And if this was good Doctrine againſt thoſe who ſeparated upon the account of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:308"/> Corruptions, for purer Ordinances in thoſe Days, I ſee not why it is not as good againſt themſelves, when upon the very ſame Pretences, and no other, they divide from us now.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Lord grant that we may all come at laſt to be of one Mind, to live in Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and then the God of Love and Peace ſhall be with us.</hi>

                        <head>Of giving OFFENCE TO <hi>Weak Brethren.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IT hath been often obſerved concerning our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren,</hi> that when they are urged to mention any one thing required of the People in the Publick Worſhip of God in our Pariſh Churches, judged by them abſolutely ſinful, on the account of which their ſeparation from us is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and conſequently juſtifiable, they either put us off with ſome inconveniencies, inexpediences or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (as they call them) ſome things appointed and uſed, which in their opinion render our ſervice leſs pure and ſpiritual; (the chief of which exceptions have been conſidered in ſeveral Diſcourſes, lately written with great temper and judgment for the ſatisfaction of all honeſt and teachable minds:) Or elſe ſome of them tell us, that they are indeed themſelves ſufficiently perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the lawfulneſs of all that is enjoyned, they do not ſee but a good Chriſtian may ſerve God acceptably and devoutly our way, and may go to Heaven living and dying in our Communion; but then there are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:310"/> many other Godly, but weaker Chriſtians of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, with whom they have been long joyned: And ſhould they now, at leaſt totally, forſake them, and conform, they ſhould thereby give great offence to all thoſe tender Conſciences, which are not thus convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the lawfulneſs of holding ſuch Communion with our Church, in Prayers and Sacraments, as is by Law required. Which is a ſin ſo Heinous and of ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequence, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 6. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a Milſtone were hanged about his Neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea;</hi> and in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account it is no leſs than Spiritual Murther, <hi>a deſtroying of him for whom Chriſt dyed,</hi> Rom 14. 15.</p>
                        <p>Now this Caſe of <hi>giving Offence to weak Brethren,</hi> I have undertaken briefly to conſider, where I once for all ſuppoſe (as all thoſe muſt do who make this the ground of their refuſing to Communicate with our Church) that nothing is amongſt us impoſed as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Communion, but what may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; for were any thing in it ſelf ſinful required by our Church, there could be no room for this Plea of <hi>Scandal:</hi> That alone would be ſufficient reaſon for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from us. I Diſcourſe therefore at this preſent only with ſuch, who for their own particular could well enough joyn with us, but dare not do it for fear of <hi>Offending</hi> thoſe, who yet ſcruple and are diſſatisfied at the uſe of our Prayers and Ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I deſign exactly to handle the whole Doctrine of <hi>Scandal,</hi> or Elaborately explain all the places of Scripture concerning it, or ſtate the Caſes there treated of; Nor ſhall I now meddle with the Duty of Governours and Superiours, how far they ought to condeſcend to the weakneſs, ignorance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:310"/> and miſtakes of thoſe under their care and charge; but I ſhall confine my ſelf to this one Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whether there doth lye any obligation upon any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian (as the caſe now ſtands amongſt us) to abſent from his Pariſh Church, or to forbear the uſe of the Forms of Prayer and Ceremonies by Law appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for fear of Offending or Scandalizing his weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here I ſhall Firſt of all inquire, what is the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>weak Brother.</hi> Secondly, What it is to <hi>Offend</hi> ſuch an one. Thirdly, How far and in what inſtances we are bound to conſider the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our <hi>Brother.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, For the reſolution of this Queſtion it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to know, what is the true notion of a <hi>weak Brother.</hi> Now a <hi>weak Brother</hi> or <hi>weak in Faith</hi> in Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes one newly converted to Chriſtianity; and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thorowly inſtructed in the principles, nor well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the practice of it, the ſame whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls <hi>a little one,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle a babe in Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1.</p>
                        <p>Converſion to Chriſtianity is often called our new birth, and conſequently at Mens firſt entrance into the Chriſtian Church, they were for a while reckoned as in an Infant ſtate; and accordingly were to be moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled and nurſed, and gently uſed, with all favour and indulgence, not driven faſter than they were able to go; till by degrees, by the improvement of their knowledge they came <hi>to be of full Age,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                        <p>They were at firſt to be fed with Milk, to be taught the eaſieſt and plaineſt Doctrines, againſt which leaſt exceptions could be made; (as our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf would not at firſt tell his Diſciples of the ſhame and ſufferings he was to undergo, and when he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:311"/> did ſpeak of them it was covertly and obſcurely, ſo that they did not perfectly underſtand him, leſt they ſhould by it have been preſently diſcouraged and tempted to have forſaken him;) no unneceſſary burdens were to be laid upon them, which might render their new Profeſſion grievous to them; every Stumbling-block and prejudice was to be removed out of their way, that might occaſion their falling; the grown Chriſtians and proficients were Charitably to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the capacity of theſe Novices, and make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and for a time bear with their Ignorance and many miſtakes and Childiſh humours, and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves their own Liberty, and become even as Children with them, as if themſelves were of the ſame mind and underſtood no better, than theſe raw beginners.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe freſh Diſciples, little ones or Babes are the ſame with thoſe St. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 14. calls <hi>weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> weak for want of Age or Growth, or as the Original word rather ſignifies, Sickly and Feeble; like a Man beginning to recover from a waſting Diſeaſe, his diſtemper, tho cured, yet hangs a long time upon him, the Dregs of it ſtill remain: He muſt for a while be carefully attended and watched, ſince every little thing diſcompoſes him, and hazards a relapſe. So was it with theſe firſt Converts. As ſoon as ever they were brought to acknowledg Jeſus to be the Son of God, and were willing to become his Diſciples, they were immediately Baptized, tho as yet they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but little of the Nature or deſign of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The Apoſtles and firſt Preachers of our Religion were in haſt to make more Proſelytes, and therefore preſently Baptized all that were willing to it without that previous Inſtruction and Preparation, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when Churches were ſetled, was made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary before Heathens or Jews could be admitted by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:311"/> Baptiſm. Thus the ſame day the Apoſtles Preached Chriſt to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. they Baptized about three thouſand of them, and <hi>Philip</hi> without any delay Baptized the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> as ſoon as he profeſſed to believe that Jeſus was the Son of God: and the Jaylor and his Houſehold were Baptized the ſame hour at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, at which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſpake unto them the word of the Lord. After their Baptiſm they were to be tutor'd and train'd up in their new Religion, where great care was to be taken, great prudence and caution uſed towards them, leſt they ſhould ſuddenly flie back and repent of their change; for having been bred up, and ſo long lived Jews or Gentiles, and then of a ſudden turn'd Chriſtians, they retain'd ſtill a great love and kindneſs for many of their old Cuſtoms and Opinions, they had mighty and inveterate prejudices to overcome, the Old man was by degrees to be put off, and therefore they were at firſt treated with all the tenderneſs and condeſcenſion imaginable, the ſtronger and wiſer Chriſtians would not ſtand rigidly on any little matters, would for the preſent tolerate many things, which were neceſſary afterwards to be done away, hoping that in time they might be better taught, and be brought off thoſe miſtakes they now Labour'd under.</p>
                        <p>Had the Apoſtles in the beginning plainly told all the Jews of the ceaſing of their Laws, the abrogation of their Ceremonies and Worſhip, the no neceſſity of Circumciſion, the taking in of the Gentiles, they would never have born ſuch Doctrines, they would never have become Chriſtians upon ſuch terms, nor ever endured thoſe Teachers, who ſeem'd to make ſo little account of <hi>Moſes</hi> and their Temple. Now to gain theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> became <hi>weak</hi> himſelf, tied up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf while amongſt theſe Jewiſh Converts to ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:312"/> which he was really free from, as if he had the ſame doubts and were of the ſame opinion with thoſe <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians, and adviſes all others who did underſtand their Liberty, yet to oblige their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by the ſame inoffenſive carriage.</p>
                        <p>This then was the difference between the <hi>ſtrong</hi> and the <hi>weak,</hi> the <hi>ſtrong</hi> were the well-grounded, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians, that knew it was lawful for them to Eat all kind of Meats, that Chriſt had ſet them free from the burdenſome Yoke of the Jewiſh Ceremonies, <hi>the weak,</hi> tho Brethren, that is, believers in Chriſt, yet abſtained from ſome Meats, judging them unlawful or unclean, and obſerved days, and Zealouſly retained the Moſaical rites, not being yet ſufficiently inſtructed in that Liberty our Saviour had purchaſed for them, or in the nature of his Kingdom, which <hi>conſiſted not in Meat or Drink, but in Righteouſneſs and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence I obſerve,</p>
                        <p>1. That the rules which are laid down in Scripture concerning <hi>weak Brethren</hi> principally reſpect thoſe times when our Religion made its firſt appearance in the World, and were temporary proviſions for the eaſier proſelyting men to the Faith of Chriſt, or the better ſecuring and fixing thoſe that were already come into the Church. They are not ſtanding Laws equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliging all Chriſtians in all Ages, but were ſuited to the Infant ſtate of the Church, or rather to its condition whilſt it was but an Embryo, till Churches were formed and ſetled, and our Chriſtianity had got firm Footing and Poſſeſſion in the World. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 Cor. 9. 19. <hi>For tho I be free from all Men, yet have I made my ſelf ſervant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, as under the Law, that I might gain them</hi>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:312"/> 
                           <hi>that are under the Law. To them that are without Law, as without Law (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt) that I might gain them that are without Law. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome. And this I do for the Goſpels ſake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</hi> This was the Apoſtles deſign in all theſe Compliances and Civilities to win many to the Faith of Chriſt, by theſe wiſe arts to inſinuate himſelf and his Doctrine into them: but when he had once made his way, he then taught them another leſſon, and behaved himſelf after a far different manner. Now to do as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, would always be the duty and wiſdom of one in his circumſtances, who had his office and was to propagate any Religion amongſt Heathens and Infidels; like a Maſter that dealeth not ſo ſharply with his Scholar at his firſt entrance into the School, as he thinketh fit to do afterwards. But the directions St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave, and according to which himſelf practis'd at the firſt planting of Chriſtianity, do no more agree with our times, wherein Chriſtianity is become the National Religion, countenanced by the Civil Laws and Authority, and ſo generally profeſſed by every one amongſt us, that we hardly know of any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than the ſame Cloaths we did wear in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy would ſerve us now when we are of full Age.</p>
                        <p>We ought indeed to be very careful of Children, and lead them by ſtrings, and remove every ſtraw and rub out of their way, leſt they ſtumble and fall, but it is ridiculous to uſe the ſame care towards grown men. None of us Labour under thoſe prejudices the firſt Chriſtians did, who forſook a Religion in which they had been bred, and long lived; and as to the Jews had left a way of Worſhip commanded them by God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:313"/> himſelf, confirmed to them by many Miracles and Wonders, delivered to them from their Fathers by a conſtant ſucceſſion of Prophets ſent from God. There is not now amongſt us any ſuch competition between two Religions, but every one learneth Chriſtianity as he doth his Mothers Tongue. The Apoſtles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and Governours of the Church carried themſelves towards theſe new Converts, as God Almighty did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he brought them firſt out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> He for a while led them by a Pillar of Fire and of a Cloud, gave them Water out of the Rock, and rain'd down Bread and Fleſh from Heaven. This he did for them whileſt in their paſſage, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily provide for them, and in ſome caſes even humour that People, leſt upon every little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they ſhould return back to the Garlick and Ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but after they were ſetled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he then left them in their own hands, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Common means to take care of and provide for themſelves, he did not ſhew the ſame indulgence to them, as he did whilſt they were in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not take that reward that was due to him for Preaching the Goſpel, but himſelf Laboured hard night and day, becauſe he would not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Converts, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 9. and this he did <hi>for the furtherance of the Goſpel,</hi> that all might ſee he did not ſerve his own Belly. But ſurely our Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren do not think themſelves obliged by this Example, in places where Publick maintenance is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on Miniſters by Law, to refuſe to take it, and earn their own Bread by ſome manual occupation, tho thereby they avoid giving offence to Quakers, and thoſe who call them hirelings, and ſay they propheſie only for filthy lucre.</p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:313"/>
                        <p>Thus it is uſually obſerved, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes quite after a different manner to the Romans and to the Galatians, tho upon the ſame ſubject. In his Epiſtle to the Romans amongſt whom he had never yet been, he pitieth and pleadeth for the <hi>weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> chargeth that they ſhould not be deſpiſed or caſt off, that no cauſe of offence ſhould be given them, but to the Galatians a People that had been fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the nature of their Chriſtian Liberty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom himſelf had planted the Goſpel, and had been preſent in perſon, and ſo knew that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood better; when ſome of them fell into the ſame Error, thinking Circumciſion and the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Moſaical Law neceſſary to Chriſtians, he chides them ſharply and rebukes them more ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Who hath bewitched you O fooliſh</hi> Galatians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He who would condeſcend to the Ignorant Novices amongſt the Romans, would not in the leaſt comply with the Galatians, that had or ought to have had more knowledge and light: and afterwards when the reaſon of ſuch forbearance ceaſed, when the nation of the Jews had rejected Chriſt, and the <hi>Gentile</hi> world was come into the Church, the obſervation of the Moſaical Law, and the diſtinction of meats con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, was ſo far from being tolerated in thoſe, whether Jews or Gentiles, who through miſtake thought themſelves obliged to it, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Rules and Canons of the Church. The ſum of all this is, that whatever Argument may be drawn from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> diſcourſes about <hi>weak Brethren</hi> by way of Analogy, or Similitude, or Parity of reaſon, yet there are no ſuch <hi>weak</hi> perſons now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, as thoſe were for whom the Apoſtle provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, or as thoſe <hi>little ones</hi> were, for whom our Saviour was ſo much concerned.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:314"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2ly,</hi> I would deſire our Diſſenting Brethren to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by what pretence they can challenge any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge belonging to them under the notion of <hi>weak Chriſtians,</hi> when according to their own opinion and conceit of themſelves, they are of all men furtheſt off from being ſuch in any ſenſe. This is as if a man worth a Thouſand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> ſhould Sue in <hi>formâ pauperis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They who take upon themſelves to be teachers of others, wiſer and better than their Neighbours, the only Sober and Godly party, and are too apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all other Chriſtians as Ignorant or Prophane, with what colour of reaſon can they plead for any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be ſhewn, or regard to be had to them in complyance with their <hi>weakneſs?</hi> Tho they love to argue againſt us from the example of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion to the uninſtructed Jews or Gentiles, yet it is apparent that they do not in other caſes willingly liken themſelves to thoſe <hi>weak</hi> believers, or <hi>Babes in Chriſt.</hi> They have really better thoughts of themſelves, and would be Leaders and Maſters in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and preſcribe to their Governours and give Laws to all others, and do prefer their own private opinion (which they call their Conſcience) before the Judgment of the wiſeſt men, or the determinations of their Lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. And if in all inſtances we ſhould deal with them as <hi>weak</hi> perſons, turn them back to their Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, adviſe them to learn their Catechiſm, they would think themſelves highly wrong'd and injured.</p>
                        <p>If the ſeveral Diſſenters amongſt us did in good earneſt look upon themſelves as <hi>weak,</hi> that is, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Wavering, half Chriſtians, did they think their diſlike of the Conſtitutions of our Church to be the effect of ſuch <hi>weakneſs,</hi> they would be either more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hide it, or would more diligently ſeek out for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:314"/> remedy; they would be more modeſt and humble, not ſo forward to judge and condemn what they do not underſtand; they would not encourage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hold out and perſiſt in this their <hi>weakneſs,</hi> nor breed up their Children in it, nor ſo Zealouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inſtil the ſame prejudices and miſtakes into all with whom they converſe. But the truth is, they ordinarily look upon their oppoſition to the orders of our Church as the effect of an higher illumination, greater knowledg than other Men have attained unto, they rather count us the <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians, if ſome of them will allow us ſo much; for otherwiſe if they do not take us for the weaker and worſe Chriſtians; Why do they ſeparate from us? Why do they aſſociate and combine together into diſtinct Congregations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purer, more ſelect Chriſtians than others? Now tho ſuch perſons as theſe may be in truth very <hi>weak,</hi> of little judgment or goodneſs, notwithſtanding this conceit of themſelves and their party, yet theſe are not by any means to plead for indulgence under that Character, nor to expect we ſhould forgo our juſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pleaſe and humour them.</p>
                        <p>And that this is nothing but the plain truth is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident from this one obſervation, that many amongſt them will grant our Reformation to have been very excellent and laudable for thoſe days of Darkneſs and Ignorance wherein it was firſt made: But we now, ſay they, ſee by a clearer light, have greater knowledge, and have arrived to higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſo diſcover and cannot bear thoſe faults and defects, which before were tolerable. Now who doth not ſee that theſe two pleas are utterly inconſiſtent and deſtructive of one another? to deſire abatement of the Ceremonies, and abolition or alteration of the Liturgy in complyance with their <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:315"/> the ſame becauſe of the greater knowledg and light they now enjoy, above that Age wherein this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſtitution of our Church was eſtabliſhed. This ſhews they will be either <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>ſtrong</hi> according as it beſt ſutes with the Argument they are managing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; they are contented to be reckoned as <hi>weak,</hi> only that on it they may ground a plauſible objection againſt us.</p>
                        <p>3 Thoſe who are really <hi>weak,</hi> that is, Ignorant and injudicious, are to be born withal only for a time, till they have received better inſtruction. We cannot be always <hi>Bahes in Chriſt,</hi> without our own groſs fault and neglect; he is ſomething worſe than a <hi>weak</hi> man who is fond of, and reſolutely againſt all means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction perſiſts in his Ignorance and miſtake. The caſe of young beginners and Novices is very pittiable, who have not been taught their leſſon, but the ſame conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion is not due to thoſe, who are <hi>ever learning and yet are never able to come to the knowledg of the truth,</hi> not for want of capacity to underſtand, but for want of humility and willingneſs to be inſtructed. Such who are peeviſh and ſtubborn, whoſe Ignorance and Error is Voluntary and affected, who will not yield to the cleareſt reaſon, if it be againſt their intereſt or their party, can upon no account claim the priviledges of <hi>weak</hi> perſons.</p>
                        <p>It is a great piece of inhumanity and cruelty to put a ſtumbling-block in the way of a blind man, but he walks at his own peril, who hath eyes and will not be perſuaded to open them, that he might ſee and chooſe his way. Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> anſwered his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when they told him that the <hi>Phariſees were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his Doctrine, Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch, St.</hi> Matt. 15. 14. They
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:315"/> were reſolved not to be ſatisfied with any thing our Saviour ſaid or did, they watched for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and ſought occaſion againſt him. It was their Malice, not their Ignorance, that made them ſo apt to be <hi>offended.</hi> Of theſe therefore our Saviour had no regard, who were ſo unreaſonable and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their oppoſition.</p>
                        <p>Not that I would be ſo uncharitable as to condemn all, or the generality of our Nonconforming Brethren for malicious and wilful in their diſſent from us. God forbid that I ſhould paſs ſuch an unmerciful ſentence on ſo many (as I believe) well meaning, tho miſerably abuſed perſons, to their own Maſter they ſtand or fall. But however,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I would out of charity to them beg earneſtly of them, that they would thorowly examine whether they have Conſcientiouſly uſed all due means in their power for information of their judgments concerning thoſe things they doubt of; whether they have ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured to ſatisfie themſelves, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly Pray'd to God to free their minds from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and corrupt affections, and have patiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the grounds and reaſons of their Separation from us; for unleſs it be thus really with them, their <hi>weakneſs</hi> is no more to be pitied, than that mans Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who might be cured by an eaſie remedy if he would but vouchſafe to apply it, or would ſubmit to good Counſel.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I muſt ſay that old and inveterate miſtakes, that have been a thouſand times anſwered and proteſted againſt, are not much to be heeded by us. If peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will by no means be prevailed upon, having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient light and time allowed them, to lay aſide their Childiſh apprehenſions and ſuſpicions, they can hardly be thought to deſerve that compaſſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:316"/> St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribes towards <hi>weak Brethren.</hi> I ſhall give one plain inſtance. Let us ſuppoſe that at the firſt Reformation of Religion amongſt us ſome very <hi>weak</hi> (and ſuch they muſt be if honeſt) were <hi>offended</hi> at the Church's requiring Kneeling at the receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them to imply the adoration of the Bread and Wine, and as likely to harden ſome Ignorant People in that monſtrous conceit of Tranſubſtantiation: But now after ſo many publick Declarations made by our Church, wherein ſhe avows that no ſuch thing is intended, after the conſtant profeſſion of ſo many, that have uſed that decent Ceremony, that they abhor the Doctrine of Chriſts bodily preſence, nay after the couragious ſufferings, even death it ſelf, of thoſe that firſt Eſtabliſhed this Reformation, rather than they would worſhip the <hi>Hoſt;</hi> if after all this, people ſhall ſtill clamour againſt this geſture as Popiſh, and be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with thoſe that uſe it, as if thereby they gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour to the Elements, all that I ſhall ſay is this, it is a great ſign that it is not infirmity only, to which condeſcenſion is due, but ſomething worſe that raiſeth and maintaineth ſuch exceptions and <hi>offences.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This I ſuppoſe holds true even in things where the <hi>offence</hi> ariſeth from their doubtful or ſuſpicious nature, that are capable of being miſunderſtood and abuſed, and may be apt through miſtake to provoke or tempt others to evil. Yet if there be no moral evil in them, and the doing of them is of ſome conſiderable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence or advantage to me, I am bound to forbear them no longer, than till I have taken due care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form others rightly of the matter, and warn them of the danger, till I have endeavoured to rectifie their judgments concerning the innocency of my action and intention, and given them notice of the evil that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:316"/> might poſſibly by my action happen to them. If I dig a pit, or lay a block in the way, whereby others not knowing any thing of it are hurt and wounded, here I ſtand chargeable with it, and am guilty in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to fall; but if they are plainly and often told of it, and being forewarned yet will run into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they are then only to thank themſelves, and it is purely their own fault. Now if it be thus in caſes that are liable to ſuſpicion and miſinterpretation, it holds much more in our Ceremonies and the orders of our Church, where the <hi>offence</hi> that is taken at them ariſeth not ſo much from the nature of the injunctions, as from mens groſs Ignorance, miſconceit or perverſeneſs. Thus men are no longer <hi>weak</hi> in Scripture ſenſe, than they are inculpably Ignorant, or which is all one, the Plea of <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is gone, after that ſufficient inſtruction hath been given or offered to them, and other allowances made according to mens different capacities of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This ſhall ſuffice for the firſt thing propounded, to ſhew what is the true notion of a <hi>weak Brother.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2 I proceed to give you an account what it is to <hi>offend</hi> ſuch an one. Becauſe I write for the uſe of the Common people only, I ſhall not trouble them with the ſeveral ſignifications of the <hi>Greek</hi> word which is Tranſlated <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>offence,</hi> nor diſtinctly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeveral places of Scripture where it is uſed, only ſo far as plainly to ſhew, Firſt, that people are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally miſtaken in the ſenſe they have of it. Secondly, What it is truly to <hi>offend</hi> or <hi>give offence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. That people are generally miſtaken about the ſenſe of <hi>offending</hi> or <hi>giving offence.</hi> For by it they commonly underſtand diſpleaſing or grieving another, and making him angry with them, and ſo conſequently they think themſelves in Conſcience bound to forbear all thoſe things, which godly perſons do not like or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:317"/> approve of, or is contrary to their fancy and judgment. It is notorious, that moſt of the ordinary ſort of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> who aſſign this as the reaſon of their not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by doing ſo they ſhall <hi>offend</hi> their Brethren, mean nothing elſe by it, but that they ſhall fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with, incur the diſpleaſure and provoke the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of thoſe, with whom they have held Communion for a long time in religious exerciſes. They, good men, will be mightily troubled and vexed to ſee or hear ſuch a ſad thing, and this is taken by many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them for an heinous crime, even the ſame which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Scandalizing a weak Brother,</hi> to do any thing which may chance to put any of their Godly Brethren out of humour.</p>
                        <p>The occaſion of this falſe apprehenſion is in all likelyhood the Ambiguity of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>offend,</hi> which is uſed in the Tranſlation of our Bibles. In our Language it ſignifies to diſpleaſe, or to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which another diſlikes; but the <hi>Greek</hi> word, which is ſo rendered, ſignifies to lay a ſtumbling block in the way of another, which cauſes him to fall, or to enſnare and deceive him into ſomething that is evil, as I ſhall ſhew more largely preſently. We muſt not therefore interpret the places of Scripture, where <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> or <hi>offence</hi> are found by the common importance of the words amongſt us, but by the undoubted ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Original word, which all learned men agree to have quite another ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>It muſt not be concealed that there is one place in the famous fourteenth chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> that ſeems to favour this popular conceit <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>If thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably,</hi> and it is the only one I know of that ſounds this way, but ſurely it is more reaſonable, that this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:317"/> one verſe ſhould be interpreted by all the other places of Scripture about this matter, than all the reſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained agreeably to this ſingle verſe. Nay it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears that by <hi>grieving</hi> our Brother, is not meant diſpleaſing him, or making him ſorry or ſad, but wounding or hurting him, and ſo it is uſed to denote, that which cauſes grief or ſorrow. For in the very next words it follows, <hi>deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died;</hi> and what is here expreſſed by <hi>grieving</hi> is <hi>v.</hi> 13. called, <hi>putting a ſtumbling-block or an occaſion to fall,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>it is good neither to eat Fleſh, nor drink Wine, nor any thing whereby thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak;</hi> all which ſignifie the ſame with being <hi>grieved.</hi> To be <hi>offended</hi> or <hi>grieved</hi> is not to be troubled at what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done out of pity and concern for his Soul, but to receive hurt our ſelves from it, being by it drawn or deceived into ſome ſin, and our own fall occaſioned by what our Brother hath done, is that which creates the grief and trouble. But becauſe this miſtake doth ſo generally prevail amongſt many, as I hope, well diſpoſed people, who think that they muſt not do any thing, at which good men are diſpleaſed or grieved, I ſhall offer theſe few things to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That thus to cenſure and condemn the actions, and to be diſpleaſed and angry with the perſons of thoſe that differ from them, or refuſe any longer to joyn with them in their Separate Congregations, is a great inſtance of peeviſhneſs and uncharitableneſs, and is that very ſin which St. <hi>Paul</hi> often warns his <hi>weak</hi> believers againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge thoſe who knew their duty, and underſtood their Chriſtian liberty better than themſelves. This ſeems to be the ſame with that Argument the Papiſts uſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:318"/> to perſwade men into, or to keep them in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as the ſafeſt way to Heaven; ſince they ſo confidently damn all Men, whom, tho never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, they thruſt out of their Church. Becauſe ſome of our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> are ſo froward and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in their cenſures, and ſo fond of their own way, as to brand all that return to the Church with the infamous names of Apoſtates, Time-ſervers, Men that have made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience, and have forſaken Chriſt for fear of Perſecution, and the like, therefore all thoſe, who are convinced of the lawfulneſs of Conformity, yet ought ſtill to continue with them in their Separation, leſt they provoke and irritate their anger and diſpleaſure againſt them; and thus any company of men, that ſhall joyn together and reſolve to quarrel with all that do not as they do, or that ſhall leave their ſociety, muſt oblige all for ever to remain with them, for fear of giving them <hi>offence.</hi> If what I do is not evil in it ſelf, it cannot become ſuch, becauſe another Man is cauſeleſly angry with me for doing of it. Let but thoſe, who Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from us, mortifie all pride and overweening opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themſelves, and their own way, let them lay aſide all Zeal of parties and little ſingularities, and learn to judge righteouſly and ſoberly of themſelves and others, and then the cauſe of all this <hi>offence</hi> will be ſoon removed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. they that pretend that this fear of <hi>offending,</hi> that is, diſpleaſing their <hi>weak</hi> Brethren hinders their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Church, ought ſeriouſly to examine themſelves, whether it is not really only the care of their credit, and reputation with their party, that keeps them from Conformity.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:318"/> Sanctity, by joyning with the ſtricteſt and pureſt Chriſtians. For undoubtedly Mens reputation amongſt a part is a very great temptation to detain them in Error, and is a mighty prejudice to their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving the truth, or the doing of their Duty, when it will expoſe them to reproach and opprobrious nicknames. Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> John 5. 44. <hi>How can ye believe, who receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When therefore Men tell us, it will be a <hi>Scandalous</hi> thing for them now to conform, they often mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe by it, but that it will be unhandſom, and a diſgraceful thing for them to change their mind, and confeſs their miſtake, and retract what they have ſo long, and ſo Zealouſly defended. Or elſe let them look well, that it is not ſome paltry ſecular intereſt, that lies at the bottom, they dare not <hi>Offend their weak Brethren,</hi> that is; they are afraid they ſhall loſe their trade, they ſhall diſoblige many of their good cuſtomers, they get their livelyhood by ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and therefore they muſt continue of it. But this is truly to become the ſervants of Men, ſuch as theſe are the moſt rank Men-pleaſers, and therefore it is good advice of <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>in his Cure of Church diviſions,</hi> p. 141. <hi>Pleaſe men in all things lawful for their good and Edification; and become all things to all men in a lawful way: But depart not from the principles or practice of Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Communion, Charity or Sobriety, to pleaſe a dividing hot brain'd Party, not to eſcape their ſharpeſt cenſures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. If to diſpleaſe our <hi>weak Brother</hi> were the ſinful <hi>offending</hi> him, condemned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it would prove an intolerable Yoke upon Mens Conſciences, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get endleſs perplexities and difficulties, ſo that we ſhould not be able to do any thing, tho never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:319"/> with a quiet and well aſſured mind, ſince as the World now is, ſome one or other will in this ſenſe be <hi>Scandalized</hi> at it. By doing we ſhall anger ſome, by forbearing we ſhall provoke others; and ſince thoſe, who call themſelves <hi>weak,</hi> are divided and ſhatter'd into ſeveral Sects and Factions, each condemning all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is impoſſible for us to comply with any one of them, but we ſhall thereby diſpleaſe all the reſt. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that would with a good Conſcience perform his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in whatever place he lives, or relation he ſtands in, muſt diſpleaſe both good and bad Men, as things now are amongſt us. <hi>It is a very ſmall thing, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>tells us, to be judged of Men,</hi> when they paſs their unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable cenſures upon us, and our actions; and they, who govern themſelves by the opinions and fancies of others, can never tell whither they ſhall be led by this principle. They are ſlaves to the Party they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe, and muſt run with them into all the Folly and Extravagance they can be guilty of; or if at laſt they are forced to leave them, they ſhall in the end be more hated and deſpiſed by them, than if they had never hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured them at all.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I add only, that according to this Rule, that we muſt not do any thing which may diſpleaſe or grieve our <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> we do in effect ſubmit our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Conſciences to the conduct of the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and injudicious Chriſtians, and yield to them that Power and Authority over us, which we deny to the Magiſtrate and our Lawful Superiours; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſeem a very hard caſe, that they who are ſo tender of their Chriſtian liberty, and think it ſo highly infringed and violated by the determinations of their Superiours about indifferent matters, ſhould yet ſuffer themſelves to be thus ſtraitly tied up by the wills and paſſions of their <hi>weak Brethren. If this</hi>

                           <hi>were ſo,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 134. of the forenamed Book, <hi>the moſt Childiſh and Womaniſh ſort of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have the weakeſt judgments, and the ſtrongeſt wills and paſſions muſt rule all the World; for theſe are hardlieſt pleaſed, and no man muſt diſpleaſe them.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever condeſcenſion therefore may be due to the <hi>weak</hi> and Ignorant, yet it was never intended that they ſhould govern the wiſer, and better inſtructed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in all their actions; and who can Govern more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, than they whoſe wills muſt never be croſſed, and whom none muſt diſpleaſe? From all this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this cannot be the ſenſe of <hi>Scandalizing or giving Offence, viz.</hi> doing of ſomething, which another takes ill, or is angry with us for it.</p>
                        <p>2. I am now in the Second place to ſhew, what is the true meaning of <hi>Offending</hi> or <hi>Scandalizing</hi> in Scripture. The <hi>Greek</hi> word which we Tranſlate <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>Offence</hi> ſignifies either a Trap and Snare, or elſe more commonly ſomething laid in the way of another, which occaſions his ſtumbling or falling, by which he is bruiſed and hurt, and ſo conſequently, whatever it was that hindred Men from becoming Chriſts Diſciples, or diſcouraged them in their new Profeſſion, or tempted them to forſake that Faith they had lately embraced, is called a <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>Offence.</hi> It is ſometimes rendred an <hi>occaſion to fall</hi> as Rom. 14. 13. <hi>occaſion of ſtumbling,</hi> as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>a ſtumbling-block,</hi> Revel. 2. 14. <hi>or a thing that doth Offend, as St.</hi> Matt. 13. 41. In all which places there is the ſame Original word.</p>
                        <p>Hence to <hi>Offend</hi> or <hi>Scandalize</hi> any one, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in the New Teſtament, is to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which tends to eſtrange or fright Men from the Chriſtian Profeſſion, to beget in them hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thoughts of it, or is apt, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:320"/> to turn them from it, and make them repent of their change. Of this I ſhall give ſome few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances out of the diſcourſes of our Saviour and his Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>Thus our Bleſſed Lord, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27. is ſaid to have paid tribute, leſt he ſhould <hi>Offend</hi> or Scandalize the Jews. This was more than he was bound to; for he tells us, <hi>the Children are free.</hi> But he did it, that he might not give any occaſion to his Enemies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him to the People, as a contemner of their Law, or an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> (according as you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Tribute to be paid either to the Romans or the Temple) and ſo prejudice them againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Doctrine. Thus our Saviours own Country-men, who were acquainted with his Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Kindred, who knew the meanneſs of his Birth and Education, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 3. were <hi>Offended</hi> or Scandalized at him. They were aſtoniſhed at the great things he did, and the greater things he ſpoke, and would in all probability have believed on him, had they not known his mean Original and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Is not this the Carpenter, the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the ſame manner, when our Lord, St. <hi>John</hi> 6. 61. had diſcourſed of <hi>eating the Fleſh of the Son of Man,</hi> they that heard him, taking it in a groſs carnal ſenſe, were <hi>Offended</hi> or Scandalized at him. They began to doubt of his being a true Prophet, or the Meſſiah, who would teach his Diſciples to turn Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals.</p>
                        <p>Thus again our Saviour, before the night in which he was betrayed told his Diſciples, St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 31. <hi>all of ye ſhall be Offended</hi> or Scandalized, <hi>becauſe of me this Night;</hi> that is, ſhall fly away and ſhamefully forſake me, when you behold my hard uſage, and diſmal ſufferings. So <hi>Chriſt Crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:320"/> 
                           <hi>to the Jews was a Scandal or ſtumbling-block;</hi> that is, they had ſet their minds and hearts on a temporal earthly King, and expected to be freed from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Yoke, and to be reſtored to their former Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and greatneſs, as the effect of the coming of their Meſſiah, and therefore could not be perſuaded to own him for their Prince, and Saviour, and the Son of God, who was put to ſuch a Curſed and Ignominious death. In the ſame ſenſe they who <hi>heard the Word of God,</hi> Mark 4. 17. <hi>and received it with gladneſs, but having no root in themſelves, when Affliction or Perſecution aroſe for the Words ſake, were preſently offended</hi> or Scandalized; that is, were ready to leave and renounce that Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that was likely to coſt them ſo dear.</p>
                        <p>After the publiſhing of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles, that which moſt ſtumbled the Jewiſh Converts, was the danger <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law and their Temple Worſhip, and the ſingular preeminences of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſeemed to be in of being undermined by Chriſtianity. They were ſtrangely wedded to their Legal obſervances, fond of Circumciſion and thoſe peculiarities, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed their Nation from the reſt of mankind, they were jealous of any Doctrine, that encroached upon their Priviledges, or tended to bring them down to the ſame level with the Uncircumciſed World. This mightily <hi>Offended</hi> them, and hardned them againſt Chriſtianity; whereas on the other ſide, the Gentile Converts with as much reaſon, were afraid of putting their Necks under ſo heavy a Yoke, or being brought into ſubjection to the Jewiſh Law, and there was no ſuch effectual way to ſcare them from Chriſtianity, as when it came attended with the burden of the Moſaical Ceremonies; which were an <hi>Offence</hi> to them; that is, did diſcourage them from believing in Chriſt, or continuing in his Faith. Now to prevent the miſchiefs, that might ariſe from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:321"/> theſe different apprehenſions amongſt the Chriſtian Proſelites, was the occaſion of the meeting of that firſt Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and of thoſe directions which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our behaviour towards <hi>weak Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another caſe there was concerning eating of things offered to Idols, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſeth in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 8. <hi>and</hi> 10. the ſum of which ſeems to be this, that the ſtronger and wiſer Chriſtians ought to abſtain from eating what had been offered to Idols, tho as ordinary meat, in the preſence of any one, who <hi>with, Conſcience of the Idol, did eat it as a thing offered to an Idol.</hi> For ſuch there were in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſo weak, as not yet to have quite left off their Idolatrous Worſhip, and a Chriſtians eating what had been Offered in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice before ſuch an one might ſerve to harden, and confirm him in his Error, <hi>whoſe Conſcience being weak is defiled.</hi> Of whoſe Soul St. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed himſelf to have ſo great regard, that he would <hi>eat no ſuch meat as long as the World laſted,</hi> rather than lay ſuch a ſtumbling-block before, or wound their <hi>weak</hi> Conſciences. In all theſe places and many more that might be named (for the fuller explication of which I refer you to interpreters, and thoſe that have written largely on this ſubject) no leſs than Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Faith was the ſin, into which theſe <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians were ſo apt to fall, and by an undue uſe of our Liberty to give occaſion to anothers forſaking the Chriſtian Religion, whereby our Saviour loſeth a Diſciple, and the Soul of our Brother periſheth, is the proper ſin of <hi>Offending,</hi> or <hi>giving Scandal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall mention but one place more, which is <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 14. where <hi>Balaam</hi> is ſaid to have taught <hi>Balac, to caſt a ſtumbling-block</hi> or Scandal <hi>before the Children</hi>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:321"/> 
                           <hi>of Iſrael,</hi> which relates othis inticing them by the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Moab</hi> to Fornication and Idolatry, and by that means provoking God againſt them. So that in the moſt general ſenſe to <hi>Scandalize</hi> or <hi>Offend</hi> any one, is, to give occaſion to his ſin, and conſequently his ruin and undoing; and this I ſuppoſe will be granted by all, that do not receive their opinions from the meer ſound of words. Hence I ſhall conclude theſe few things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The better Men are, the harder it is to <hi>Scandalize</hi> them: Thoſe are not ſuch Godly perſons, as they would be thought, who are ſo ready at all turns to be <hi>Offended;</hi> for how can they be reckon'd to excel others in knowledg or goodneſs, who are ſo eaſily upon every occaſion drawn or tempted to ſin? Thus Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf tells the Separatiſts in his <hi>Cure of Church Diviſions. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>men talk moſt againſt Scandalizing thoſe, whom they account to be the beſt, and the beſt are leaſt in danger of ſinning; and ſo they accuſe them to be the worſt, or elſe they know not what they ſay; for ſuppoſe a Separatiſt ſhould ſay, if you hold Communion with any Pariſh Miniſter or Church in</hi> England, <hi>it will be a Scandal to many good people: I would ask ſuch an one, Why call you thoſe good people that are eaſily drawn to ſin againſt God? Nay, that will ſin becauſe I do my duty: Therefore if you know what you ſay, you make the Separatiſts almoſt the worſt of men, that will ſin againſt God, becauſe another will not ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The great thing our <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> pretend unto above other men is tenderneſs of Conſcience, by which they muſt mean, if they mean any Vertue by it, a great fear of doing any thing that is evil; and this, where it is in truth, is the beſt ſecurity that can be deviſed againſt being <hi>Scandalized</hi> or <hi>Offended,</hi> by what other Men do; that is, againſt being drawn into ſin by it. So that they do really diſparage and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:322"/> reflect upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who are thus afraid of giving them <hi>Offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> as I have explained it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. No man can with ſenſe ſay of himſelf, that he ſhall be <hi>Scandalized</hi> at what another man does; for it is as much as to ſay, that by ſuch a perſon and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſhall be led into ſin ignorantly, and his ſaying this confutes his ignorance: If he knows it to be a ſin, he is not betrayed into it, nor doth he fall into it through ignorance and miſtake (which is the caſe of thoſe that are <hi>Scandalized)</hi> but wilfully commits it. This a great Biſhop compares with the peeviſhneſs of a little Child, who when he is commanded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the word he hath no mind to, tells you he cannot pronounce that word, at the ſame time naming the word he pretends he cannot ſpeak. Such Nonſenſe it is for a man to forbid me doing any thing upon pretence it will be a <hi>Scandal</hi> to him, or make him through miſtake fall into ſome ſin, when by this it is plain, that he knows of it beforehand, and ſo may, and ought to avoid the ſtumbling-block that is laid before him, and the danger that he is expoſed unto. <hi>Surely</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 1. 17. <hi>in vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If to <hi>Offend</hi> or <hi>Scandalize,</hi> any one is to tempt and draw him into ſome ſin, whereby his Conſcience is wounded, there then can be no fear of giving Offence by our Conformity to the orders and uſages of our Church, becauſe there is nothing appointed by or uſed in it, but what may be complyed withal without ſin: For this, as I before obſerved, is ſuppoſed in the Queſtion I at firſt propounded to diſcourſe of; that he, who abſented from his Pariſh Church for fear of <hi>Offending his weak Brethren,</hi> was convinced in his own mind of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of all that is enjoyn'd; and therefore by his own Conformity, he can only engage others to do as he hath done, which as long as he is perſwaded to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:322"/> lawful, I do not ſee how he can be afraid of <hi>Scandaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> others by it, or making them to ſin by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unleſs he will imagine his Brethren, not ſo <hi>weak,</hi> but ſo wicked, as to Worſhip the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> becauſe he Kneels at receiving of the Sacrament, and to adore the Croſs becauſe he bows at the Name of Jeſus, or that they will renounce all Religion becauſe he hath forſaken their ways of Separation: This cannot but prove a vain excuſe for me to forbear doing that, in which there is really no evil, leſt by the Authority of my example I make others ſin in doing the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent action; which in this caſe is ſo far from being to be feared, that if by my example I prevail with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to return into the Communion of our Church, they are not thereby at all <hi>Scandalized,</hi> but I have done them a moſt ſignal kindneſs and benefit.</p>
                        <p>If it be ſaid, that tho what I do is in it ſelf lawful, yet it may miniſter occaſion or provocation to others to do ſomething elſe that is unlawful, and ſo I become truly guilty of giving <hi>Offence;</hi> I Anſwer, that we are accountable only for the natural tendencies, or probable effects of our actions, which may be eaſily foreſeen and prevented. Remote probabilites and contingencies and bare poſſibilities come not into reckoning, nor are they at all to be weighed. If in every action I am bound to conſider what advantage a wicked ſenſual Man, or a weak ſilly man might take, and what Arguments he might poſſibly thence draw to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf in ſin and folly, or excuſe himſelf from the care of his Soul and Religion, this would open the door to infinite Scrupuloſity and trouble, and I ſhould hardly be able to do or ſpeak any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the incurring the guilt of giving <hi>Scandal.</hi> Now this being ſuppoſed, I dare boldly challenge any Man to name any one ſin either againſt God, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:323"/> or our ſelves, that our Conformity doth give any real probable occaſion unto; and it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable to conceit, that our Nonconforming Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will out of meer perverſeneſs, or ſpite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge run into ſin, on purpoſe to make our leaving them criminal and vicious; which if any ſhould be ſo wicked as to do, yet they would loſe the deſign of their malice, and prove the only guilty perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>The only thing I imagine can be further ſaid in this caſe is, that tho I am well ſatisfied my ſelf, yet by my Conformity I may tempt and provoke others that are not ſatisfied concerning the lawfulneſs of it, nay thoſe who judge it abſolutely ſinful, yet rather than ſtand out, or being moved by the opin on they have of my goodneſs and Wiſdom, to follow my example with a doubting or gainſaying Conſcience. Suppoſe a Maſter of Family that uſed to frequent the private Meetings, and his Wife and Children and Servants uſed to follow him thither; but afterwards, by reading of ſuch good Books as have been lately written, is himſelf ſatisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawfulneſs of going to Church, and at laſt thinks it his duty ſo to do, only he is afraid that the reſt of his Family to pleaſe and humour him, will be apt alſo to forſake the private Meetings, and go along with him to Church, tho it be altogether againſt their judgment and Conſcience: Or ſuppoſe him a man of eminency amongſt his Neighbours, on whoſe favour many do depend, of great intereſt and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by whoſe example many are ſway'd and led. Tho himſelf doth conform upon good reaſons and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yet his example may invite many others to it, tho they have received no ſatisfaction concerning the lawfulneſs of it.</p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:323"/>
                        <p>Now here I deſire theſe three things may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is certain that it is as unlawful to go to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Meetings againſt ones Conſcience, as it is to go to the publick Church againſt ones Conſcience. Why then ought not this man to be as afraid, when he leaves his Pariſh-Church and frequents the private Congregation, leſt he ſhould draw ſome to follow him thither with a doubting Conſcience; as well as he fears, if he leaves the Meetings and reſorts to his Pariſh-Church, ſome not ſatisfied concerning the lawfulneſs of it, ſhould come after him thither? The influence of his Example, intereſt, reputation, is the ſame in both inſtances; the danger of giving this <hi>Scandal</hi> is equal; that therefore wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ch ought to determine his practice muſt be his own Judgment and perſuaſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such an one, who hath been a Separatiſt, but is now himſelf ſatisfied of the lawfulneſs of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; ought to take great care and pains in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſatisfie others alſo, eſpecially thoſe, whom he hath any cauſe to think to have been led into the ways of Separation by his example: He muſt not be aſhamed to own his former miſtake, to ſet before them the reaſons on which his change is grounded, and muſt do this publickly and frequently, perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to uſe the ſame helps and means, which were ſo effectual for his own conviction. And thus he doth all that lieth in his power to prevent this ill effect and ſhall not be further anſwerable for the conſequences of what he doth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is truly obſerved by ſome that conſidering the known temper of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> it is not very likely any ſuch miſchief ſhould enſue, <hi>viz.</hi> that by the example of one or more leaving their Separate Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, others ſhould be moved to follow them againſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:324"/> their own Judgment and Conſcience. It is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notorious how they have uſed to treat thoſe that have deſerted them; with what irreconcileable enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they have proſecuted them, looking upon them as their worſt Enemies, paſſing more grievous cenſures upon them than upon thoſe who have all their lives long continued in our Communion.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I proceed in the laſt place to obſerve from what I have diſcourſed concerning <hi>giving Offence,</hi> that if to <hi>Offend</hi> any one, be to lead him into ſin, then we may <hi>Scandalize</hi> and <hi>give Offence</hi> to others, as ſoon by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them and complying with them, as by dipleaſing them and going contrary to their mind and humour.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who Circumciſed <hi>Timothy, Acts</hi> 16. 3. in favour of the <hi>weak Jews</hi> that he might inſinuate and ingratiate himſelf into them, refuſed to Circumciſe <hi>Titus, Galat.</hi> 2. 3. tho he made the <hi>Jews</hi> angry by it, yet he would <hi>not give place by ſubjection,</hi> or ſubmiſſion and condeſcenſion to them, <hi>no not for an hour:</hi> He conſidered the different ſtates and conditions of the perſons he had to deal withal. He complyed to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> leſt all the <hi>Jews</hi> with him ſhould have forſaken the Chriſtian Faith, and for the ſame reaſon he denied to Circumciſe <hi>Titus,</hi> leſt thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould think he was of opinion, that the Jewiſh Law held ſtill in force, and ſo the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould become of no effect to them. He pleaſed indeed the former for fear of driving them from Chriſtianity, and for the ſame reaſon he diſpleaſed the latter, leſt he ſhould give them occaſion to think the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law always neceſſary. He had truly <hi>Scandalized</hi> them, if he had done as they would have had him: He had <hi>Offended</hi> them in the true Scripture ſenſe, if he had pleaſed and humoured them; and this is the moſt ordinary way of <hi>Scandalizing</hi> Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:324"/> us, by not plainly telling Men of their faults and miſtakes, by not ſpeaking freely and roundly to them, nor acting couragiouſly, whereby they become hardned and confirmed in their folly and ignorance.</p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe I cannot but repeat the words of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the <hi>Book</hi> I have ſo often cited; <hi>Many a time,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have the rather gone to the Common-Prayers of the publick Aſſemblies for fear of being a Scandal to thoſe ſame men that called the going to them a Scandal: that is, for fear of hardning them in a ſinful Separation and Error; becauſe I knew that was not Scandal which they called Scandal; that is, diſpleaſing them, and croſſing their opinions; but hardning them in an Error or other ſin, is true Scandalizing. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand this, or you will diſpleaſe God under pretence of avoiding Scandal,</hi> p. 135.</p>
                        <p>Thus by complying with our Diſſenting Brethren we really do them that miſchief which we would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, and fall into the ſin of giving <hi>Scandal,</hi> whileſt we are running from it; We countenance and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their ſinful Separation and Diviſion; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in their dangerous Errors and Miſtakes; we by our practice condemn thoſe things, which yet in our Conſciences we allow and approve of, and by our Authority and influence harden others in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable prejudices and oppoſition againſt the lawful Commands of their Superiours. They think us of the ſame mind with themſelves, whilſt we do the ſame things, and that we judge as ill of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as long as we refuſe to Communicate with it, as themſelves do; and thus we give occaſion to their ſin, and thoſe infinite miſchiefs which have happened both to Church and State, upon the account of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſputes and diviſions; which ſurely ought to be well thought of and conſidered by a ſort of Men amongſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:325"/> us, who ſhall go to Church in the Morning, and to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle in the Afternoon; who halt between both, and would fain diſpleaſe neither ſide, but indeed give real <hi>Offence</hi> to both. From all this I think it is very plain, that he, who is ſatisfied in his own mind of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Conformity, but is afraid of giving <hi>Offence</hi> by it, if he be true to this principle, ought to haſten the faſter to his Pariſh-Church, that he might not <hi>Offend</hi> thoſe very Diſſenters of whom he would ſeem to be ſo tender; and thus I have done with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing I propounded to ſhew, what is meant by <hi>Offending</hi> or <hi>Scandalizing,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. It remaineth in the Third and Laſt place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; how far, and in what inſtances we are bound to conſider the ignorance or <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? In Anſwer to this, that I may proceed with all the clearneſs I can, I ſhall now ſuppoſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all I have already ſaid, that our <hi>Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> are truly <hi>weak</hi> perſons, and that there may be ſome danger of their being through their own fault <hi>Offended</hi> by our Conformity; yet taking this for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhall plainly ſhew that he, who is in his own mind convinced of the lawfulneſs of coming to his Pariſh-Church, and uſing the Forms of Prayer and Ceremonies by Law appointed, ought not to forbear doing the ſame for fear of giving ſuch <hi>Offence</hi> to his <hi>weak Brethren.</hi> There are many other things to be conſidered in this Caſe, beſides this matter of private <hi>Scandal;</hi> and if there be greater evil in, and greater miſchief to others, and a more publick <hi>Scandal</hi> doth follow our forbearing Communion with the Church and withdrawing into private Aſſemblies, than can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by our leaving them and returning to the Church, and complying with its orders, we ought then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form notwithſtanding the <hi>Offence</hi> that is imagined may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:325"/> be taken at it. For theſe two things, as I ſuppoſe, are agreed on all hands; one is, that nothing which is ſinful may be done to avoid <hi>Scandalizing</hi> others; the other is, that to avoid a leſs <hi>Scandal</hi> being taken by a few, we muſt not give a greater <hi>Scandal</hi> and of vaſtly more pernicious conſequence to a much bigger number of perſons; and by theſe two Rules I ſhall now judge of the Caſe at firſt propounded.</p>
                        <p>1. Nothing that is ſinful may be done to avoid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being <hi>Scandalized,</hi> which is directly the <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. <hi>That we muſt not do evil, that good may come;</hi> nor is any neceſſary duty to be omitted out of prudence or charity to others, leſt they through Error or Ignorance be hurt by it: We muſt not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the greateſt ſin in another, commit the leaſt ſin our ſelves, nor diſobey Gods Law, and ſo run the hazard of our own damnation, tho it be to ſave the Soul of our Brother. Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us, <hi>Inſtit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>Quae neceſſaria ſunt factu, nullius offendiculi timore omittenda ſunt. Whatever is neceſſary to be done by vertue of Gods Command is not to be omitted for fear of Offence;</hi> and again in the ſame place, <hi>Hic Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis rationem haberi decet, ſed uſque ad aras. Our charity to our Brother ought to be limited by this, that we do not for his ſake diſpleaſe God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The very beſt things and actions may be perverted by Men of ill-diſpoſed or weak minds, falſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and unjuſt inferences may be ſtrained from them; as we know the grace of God in the Goſpel was abuſed into an argument for licentiouſneſs, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is ſaid <hi>to be ſet for the fall of many,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 24. but ſtill this doth not Cancel our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to univerſal obedience to Gods Law, nor can it alter the nature of good and evil, duty and ſin; which are no ſuch uncertain contingent things, as to depend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:326"/> upon the conſtructions others ſhall make of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the concluſions they ſhall draw from them. God Almighty in the making of his Laws hath a perfect comprehenſion of all the accidental events, that may happen either through the weakneſs or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Men; and we muſt not think our ſelves to be wiſer than God, taking upon our ſelves to diſpenſe with his Commands without any allowance from him, as if himſelf had not foreſeen thoſe inconveniences which may ariſe from our doing our duty: it can therefore never be, that obedience to God ſhould give any real <hi>Scandal;</hi> and whatever <hi>Offence</hi> may be taken at my doing of my duty, it is a contradiction to imagine it imputable to me, as a ſin or fault, (for it is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one to diſobey God, in obeying him) but they alone are chargeable who are <hi>Offended</hi> by it.</p>
                        <p>Now by the expreſs Command of God, we are obliged to obey the lawful injunctions of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical; and if any are ſo hardy as to deny this, they muſt ſeek for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bible</hi> out of which to judge of Gods will; for there is hardly any one duty of Religion more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commanded, more frequently and earneſtly preſſed in the New Teſtament, than quiet and peaceable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Authority, both in Church and State, in all things lawful, and that not only to avoid puniſhment, but for Conſcience ſake; and to refuſe obedience in ſuch things, is a ſin againſt the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That the Conformity required by our Church, contains not any thing in it unlawful, muſt be granted, as I have already obſerved, by all thoſe who make uſe of this Plea of <hi>Scandal,</hi> from all which the neceſſary Concluſion is,</p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:326"/>
                        <p>Since we may not redeem a <hi>Scandal</hi> by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, ſince God hath plainly required our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to thoſe whom he hath ſet over us in all things, lawful; ſince it is acknowledged by thoſe I now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with, that Conformity to the Church is enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a competent Authority, and is lawful; I ſay the neceſſary concluſion is, that no Man can with a good Conſcience refuſe to conform only for fear of <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> when they are urged with this Argument neither do nor can deny any of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they muſt confeſs that no ſin may be committed upon any account whatſoever, and that a Man is not bound to provide for his Brothers ſafety by wounding his own Soul; they cannot deny but that God hath Commanded us to be ſubject to Lawful Authority in all things lawful, but then to evade the force of this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have endeavoured to load the concluſion with ſome ſeeming difficulties and abſurdities, which they pretend follow from this principle, that we are bound to obey, notwithſtanding the <hi>Scandal</hi> that may enſue upon it. The chief of theſe I ſhall mention, and briefly return an Anſwer to them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is pleaded that <hi>thoſe precepts, which contain only rituals, are to give place to thoſe, which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the welfare of Mens Bodies, and much more to thoſe, which do reſpect the welfare of our Brothers Soul; ſo that, when both together cannot be obſerved, we muſt neglect or violate the former, to obſerve the latter:</hi> That this is true even of ſome Commands given by God himſelf; to which purpoſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth produce that ſaying of the <hi>Prophet</hi> Hoſea, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi> Now if <hi>Sacrifices</hi> preſcribed by God himſelf, which were ſo conſiderable a part of the Divine Worſhip under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, yet were to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:327"/> give place to acts of mercy, how much more are the poſitive injunctions of Men, that concern only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals and circumſtantials of Religion to yield to the Royal and indiſpenſable Law of Charity, of which this duty of not giving <hi>Offence</hi> to others, is ſuch an Eminent part. Thus ſaith Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of <hi>Scholaſtical Divinity, What Laws of any Earthly Wight whatſoever concerning Ceremonies can be more obligatory, than the Commands of God touching the externals of his Worſhip and Service; and yet it is his will and pleaſure, that theſe externals of his Worſhip ſhould be laid aſide for the performance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works of mercy: If therefore the ſacred Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God are to give way unto works of mercy unto the bodies of Men, ſurely then much more is the traſh of human inventions to yield unto a work of mercy to the Souls of Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In anſwer to this, it is readily acknowledged that when there doth happen any ſuch interfering between two Commands of God, the one Poſitive, the other Moral, the Poſitive ought always to give place to the Moral; and by the ſame reaſon the poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our Superiours ought certainly to give way to the Moral Commands of God, which are of eternal and immutable obligation. They ceaſe to bind us either in caſe of abſolute neceſſity, or when they plainly hinder our performance of any Moral duty to God or our Neighbour; and the Church is preſumed to diſpenſe with its orders, as God Almighty doth allow the neglect of his own poſitive Inſtitutions in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. But then this is only, where the neceſſity is urgent and extream, the ſin we muſt otherwiſe commit evident and certain; and at laſt our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is diſpenſed withal only for that one time.</p>
                        <p>Thus in a caſe of neceſſity, Our <hi>Saviour St.</hi> Matth.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:327"/> 12. 5. acquits <hi>David</hi> and his followers of all blame, who being ready to periſh for hunger, <hi>did eat of the Shewbread, which otherwiſe, was not lawful for them to eat;</hi> but had they taken a particular fancy to that Bread, and refuſed to have eaten of any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that beſt agreed with their Stomacks and was moſt pleaſing to their Palate; can we think our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> would have ſo eaſily excuſed them? Or which is nearer to our Caſe; becauſe God did prefer acts of <hi>Mercy</hi> before <hi>Sacrifices</hi> where both could not be done, yet this would not have juſtified any mans wholly leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> or refuſing to do it at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting another way of Worſhip, as more expedient than Sacrificing, or chooſing another place to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in, which might be more convenient for all the <hi>Jews</hi> than that City was. We may leave our Prayers, forſake the Church to ſave the life of our Neighbour, or to quench the firing of his Houſe, but ſtill this would be but a pityful pretence for our wholly abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves from Church, and conſtant neglect of our Prayers, becauſe in the mean time our Neighbours life may be invaded, or his houſe fired by ill Men, of which there is great ſtore in the World, and ſo he may ſtand in need of our help, which is a more acceptable Service to God than any acts of Devotion. So that however this Argument may ſerve to excuſe the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome things Commanded by lawful Authority, by thoſe who otherwiſe are perfectly conformable, in extraordinary caſes which very rarely happen, and for which no proviſion could be made by Law; yet to be ſure this will not at all help thoſe, who bid open defiance to the Laws, ſtand out in manifeſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt them, live in plain diſobedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to them as if they were altogether free from them, nay ſet up a diſtinct way and form of Worſhip
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:328"/> of their own, and all this becauſe they are loth to <hi>Offend</hi> thoſe, who are not ſatisfied of the wiſdom and goodneſs of what is appointed.</p>
                        <p>Thus our Diſſenting Brethren can gain but little by this Plea if granted to them; for upon this account of exerciſing mercy and charity towards their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they can be excuſed from Obedience to their Superiours in ſuch caſes only, in which they may be excuſed alſo from the obſervation of the Sabbath, from Prayer publick or private, from Worſhipping of God either in the Church or in a Conventicle, nay from Obedience to God himſelf; had he pleaſed in the Scriptures poſitively to have required whatever is at preſent enjoyned by our Church; and let them well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether if God had plainly in his Word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed all that our Church doth Command, they would have thought it ſelfe to have refuſed compliance with ſuch divine impoſitions, becauſe they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably <hi>offenſive</hi> to ſome Godly people: If our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will but acknowledge themſelves bound to ſubmit to the determinations of their Superiours about the things in controverſie between us, ſo far, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to obey the ordinances of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his external Worſhip delivered by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that they are freed from ſuch obligation to obey the Laws of their Governours only in ſuch caſes, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were excuſed from offering their accuſtomed Sacrifices, or as they think themſelves at liberty to break the Sabbath, to omit Gods Publick Worſhip, I ſuppoſe this diſpute would ſoon be at an end, for they dare not own, that the <hi>Scandal</hi> others may take at ſuch things, which yet are to give place to moral duties, is ſufficient to void their obligation to the doing of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> (whoſe objections I ſhall the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider becauſe of his eminency amongſt the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:328"/> tho I find my ſelf ſomewhat prevented by a late Writer, who hath taken particular notice of them) thus putteth the Queſtion, <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Monarch upon the face of the Earth ſhould command the meaneſt and loweſt of his Slaves, upon ſome important affair to ride Poſt through ſuch a City, without any of the leaſt ſtay or diverſion, and then it ſhould happen that a company of little Children ſhould be playing in the Streets, can this Slave think that he is obliged to ride over them?</hi> No ſurely, he ought to uſe all means, and take all care poſſible to execute his Commiſſion without doing any hurt, or damage to any perſon whatever; but if he would have ſtated the caſe right, it ſhould have been done thus; ſuppoſe this Slave ſhould utterly refuſe to do as he was Commanded, and for his juſtification ſhould plead, that he muſt be forced to ride through many Towns and Cities, where are many little Children, who are often playing at the Doors or in the Streets; he knows not but that ſome of them may be in his way, or chance to run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Horſes legs, and therefore to avoid the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this miſchief, which might poſſibly happen, he reſolves not to ſtir one foot from his own home. Is this pretence ſufficient to excuſe his diſobedience? No more can our Nonconformity to the rules given us by our Superiours be innocent, becauſe ſome may be <hi>Scandalized</hi> at our Obedience.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is further ſaid that <hi>Scandal is in the nature of it ſpiritual murder, and if where Authority hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined our choice, we muſt hold to their determination, any Scandal to the contrary notwithſtanding, it ſeemeth then in caſe the Magiſtrate command it, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully murther the Soul of our Brother, wound his weak Conſcience, and deſtroy with our meats, our Ceremonies, the work of God, and him for whom Chriſt died. It is</hi>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:329"/> 
                           <hi>good, ſaith St.</hi> Paul, Rom. 14. 21. <hi>neither to eat Fleſh, nor to drink Wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. But our Prelatiſts, ſaith Mr.</hi> Jeans, <hi>determine quite otherwiſe. If Authority enjoyn it, it is good, ſay they, to eat Bread, drink Wine, wear a Surplice, uſe the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, tho thereby never ſo many Brethren ſtumble, or are offended, or made weak.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But all this is meer bugbear, fitted only to fright Children and ſuch weak perſons, as we are now treating of; for it can never be ſhewen, how wearing a Surplice, or Kneeling at receiving of the Sacrament, or Croſſing the Infants forehead, hath any tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſcaring Men from Chriſtianity, or making them to deny Chriſt, and forſake and grow weary of his Religion, which I have ſufficiently proved to be the only proper <hi>Scandalizing</hi> of our Brother, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo highly aggravateth, and chargeth with the guilt of deſtroying and murthering his Soul; none of theſe things do directly and immediately lead or tempt any man to any ſin: Whatever <hi>Scandal</hi> may follow is wholly accidental and the fault and miſtake of thoſe only, who are <hi>Offended,</hi> and to provide always againſt ſuch <hi>Scandals</hi> is an impoſſible undertaking; for they may follow the moſt innocent actions, nay the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duties, and this Argument concludes as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt obedience to any other Command of God, if by it my <hi>Brother may ſtumble, or be offended, or be made weak,</hi> as it doth againſt ſubmiſſion to our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in things lawful.</p>
                        <p>They that make theſe Objections do not ſufficiently conſider, that by Gods Law we are bound to obey the Lawful Commands of our Superiours; and it is not only the Law or Ordinance of Man, of which they ſeem to make ſo little account, but it is the Law of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:329"/> God alſo, that is violated by our diſobedience to our Governours in things Lawful: The Compariſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be only, as they make it, between an human Authority determining ſome indifferent things, and the divine Law of charity to the Soul of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but between the divine Command of obedience to our Superiours, and the avoiding of <hi>Scandal:</hi> Here we affirm, that we cannot be bound to tranſgreſs a plain Law of God, or which is all one in this Queſtion, a lawful command of our Superiours for fear of ſome evil that may by chance happen to ſome others through their own fault; and we prove it by this reaſon, which our Diſſenting Brethren muſt own for true and good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>every one is bound to have a greater care of his own than others Salvation, and conſequently rather to avoid ſin in himſelf, than to prevent it in his Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it be here asked, as it is by ſome, <hi>whether any human Authority can make that action ceaſe to be Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, which if done without any ſuch Command had been criminal upon the account of the Scandal that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it,</hi> I Anſwer, that no Authority, whether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or human, can ſecure that others ſhall not be <hi>Offended</hi> by what I do out of obedience to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but then it doth free me from all guilt and blame, by making that to become my duty to do, which if I had done needleſly without any great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and my Brother had been hurt and his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wounded by it, might have been juſtly charged with uncharitableneſs, greater or leſs according as the <hi>Scandal</hi> was more or leſs probable to follow.</p>
                        <p>This muſt be granted, that the Laws of God or Man, otherwiſe obligatory, do not loſe their binding force becauſe of ſome <hi>Scandal,</hi> that may poſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from our Complyance with them, or elſe all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is utterly void and inſignificant, and every Man
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:330"/> is at liberty to do all things as himſelf pleaſeth; for, to borrow the words of the excellent Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon, To allow Men under pretence that ſome offence may be taken thereat, to diſobey Laws and Conſtitutions made by thoſe that are in Authority over us, is the next way to cut the ſinews of all Authority, and to bring both Magiſtrates and Laws into contempt; for what Law ever was made, or can be made ſo juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but ſome Man or other either did or might take offence thereat.</hi> Whether ſuch a Conſtitution or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Superiours be Scandalous or no, every one muſt judge for himſelf; and ſo according to his own private opinion of the goodneſs or hurtfulneſs of what is required, he is free to obey it or not, which is directly to diſſolve all Government, and to bring in certain diſorder and everlaſting confuſion, every one doing what is good in his own Eyes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is ſaid, that <hi>Avoiding of Scandal is a main duty of charity; May Superiours therefore at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure appoint, how far I ſhall ſhew my charity towards my Brothers Soul? then ſurely an inferiour Earthly Court may croſs the determinations of the High Court of Heaven:</hi> This Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> urgeth alſo out of <hi>Ameſius; but it is eaſily replyed,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That here is no Croſſing the determinations of God, ſince it is his expreſs will, that in all lawful things we ſhould obey our Governours, and he who hath made this our duty, will not lay to our charge the miſchiefs, that may ſometimes without our fault through the folly and peeviſhneſs of Men follow from it, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is as equal and reaſonable, that our Superiours ſhould appoint how far I ſhall exerciſe my charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Brethren, as it is, that the miſtake and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of any private Chriſtians ſhould ſet bounds to their Power and Authority, Cancel the publick Laws,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:330"/> or that every ignorant and froward Brother ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, how far we ſhall be obedient to thoſe, whom God hath ſet over us either in Church or State.</p>
                        <p>But to give a more full Anſwer to this we muſt know, that, tho charity be the great duty, eſpecially of the Chriſtian Religion, yet duties of juſtice (as they are commonly called) are of ſtricter obligation than duties of charity, and we are bound to pay our debts, before we give an alms. Now obedience to Superiours is a debt we owe to them, which they have right to exact of us, ſo that they may accuſe us of injury, if we perform it not. But a great care to hinder ſin in others, or not to Scandalize them is a duty of charity, which indeed we are obliged unto as far as we can, but not till after we have given to every one what is his due and right. <hi>It is therefore no more Lawful for me,</hi> ſaith the forenamed moſt Judicious Biſhop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon, to diſobey the lawful Command of a Superiour, to prevent thereby the offence of one or a few Brethren; then it is lawful for me to do one man wrong to do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man a courteſie withal; or than it is lawful for me to rob the Exchequer to relieve an Hoſpital.</hi> According to that known ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin, Quis eſt qui dicat, ut habeamus quod demus pauperibus, faciamus furta divitibus? Who is it, that ſaith it is lawful to ſteal from the rich, what we may beſtow on the poor?</hi> or to refuſe to pay Taxes, on pretence that you know thoſe who have more need of your money?</p>
                        <p>To this Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> replies, <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the care of not giving offence be in reſpect of our Brother but a debt of charity, yet in regard of God it is a legal debt, ſince he may and doth challenge it as due, and we do him wrong if we diſobey him:</hi> Here I grant indeed, that both are required by God at our hands, that we ſhould be obedient to our Superiours, and that we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:331"/> ſhould be always ready to ſhew charity to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but then I ſay, this is not the charity which God requires, when I give to thoſe in want, what is none of mine own. This is not an inſtance or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that love and kindneſs, which by the Law of God we owe to our Brother, to do him good by wronging our Superiours. God hath obliged Servants to be merciful to the poor to their power, as well as to be true and faithful to their Maſters; but that is no part of the mercy which God requires from them, to give away their Maſters goods without his leave, tho it were to thoſe who ſtand in great need of relief. God hath Commanded all Chriſtians to have a great care of being any occaſion of their Brothers ſin or fall; but then this muſt neceſſarily be underſtood only of things ſubject to our own ordering and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In all caſes, wherein we are at our own diſpoſal, we are bound charitably to regard our Brother. But in inſtances, where our practice is determined by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, our Superiours only are to conſider the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Scandal; we muſt conſider the duty we owe to them, this being a matter wherein we cannot ſhew our charity without violating the right of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; It remains then, in the words of another great <hi>Biſhop, in what caſe ſoever we are bound to obey God or Man, in that caſe and in that conjunction of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we have nothing permitted to our choice,</hi> (and conſequently there is no place for any act of charity) <hi>and have no Authority to remit of the right of God or our Superiour; and to comply with our Neighbour in ſuch Queſtions, beſides that it cannot ſerve any purpoſes of piety, if it declines from duty in any inſtance, it is like giving Alms out of the portion of Orphans, or building Hoſpitals with the Money and ſpoils of Sacrilege.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:331"/>
                        <p n="4">4. It is further ſaid by Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> out of <hi>Ameſius, If determination by Superiours is ſufficient to take away the ſin of Scandal, then they do very ill, that they do not, ſo far as is poſſible, determine all things indifferent, that ſo no danger may be left of giving Offence by the uſe of them. Then the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is to be praiſed in that ſhe hath determined ſo many indifferent things. Then St.</hi> Paul <hi>might have ſpared all his directions about forbearance out of reſpect to weak Brethren, and fully determined the matters in debate, and ſo put an end to all fear of Scandal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This truly ſeemeth a very odd way of arguing, and all that I ſhall ſay to it is, that it ſuppoſeth nothing elſe worthy to be conſidered in the making of Laws, or in the determinations of Superiours about indifferent things, but only this one matter of Scandal; and the project it ſelf, ſhould it take, would prove very vain and unſucceſsful. For tho we truly ſay, that we are bound to comply with the Orders and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they being but few and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and ſo giving no real ground of <hi>Offence;</hi> yet we do not ſay the ſame upon ſuppoſition our Church had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined all circumſtances in Gods Worſhip ſhe poſſibly could, which would perhaps have been a yoke great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than that of the Ceremonial Law to the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor if ſhe had preſcribed as many Ceremonies as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done, which manifeſtly tend to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Scandal of our Chriſtian Religion; and as for the courſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> took, it is plain that ſome things upon good reaſons were determined by the Apoſtles, as that the Gentile Converts ſhould <hi>abſtain from blood, and things ſtrangled, and offered to Idols,</hi> which decree, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, they might not Tranſgreſs out of charity to any of their Brethren, who might take <hi>Offence</hi> at ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, and other things for great reaſon were for a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:332"/> time left at liberty, which reaſon was taken from the preſent circumſtances of thoſe the Apoſtles had to deal withal; tho afterwards, as I obſerved before, when that reaſon ceaſed, determinations were made about thoſe things which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had left at liberty, and if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had determined the diſpute about <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>days</hi> one way, they, who had followed ſo great an Authority, whatever had happened, had ſurely been free from the ſin of <hi>Scandal;</hi> but ſtill the <hi>Scandal</hi> had not been prevented, but all the contrary part had been in danger to have been utterly eſtranged from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and that was reaſon ſufficient why St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not make any determinations in that caſe. For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are not only to take care to free thoſe that obey them from the ſin of <hi>Scandal,</hi> but alſo to provide, that as little occaſion, as is poſſible, may be given to any to be <hi>Scandalized.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are other Objections offered by Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi> out of <hi>Ameſius</hi> and <hi>Rutherford,</hi> againſt this Doctrine of our obligation to obedience to Superiours in things lawful, notwithſtanding the Scandal that may follow; but they either may be Anſwered from what I have already ſaid, or elſe they chiefly concern the caſe of Governours, and are brought to prove that they act uncharitably, and give great <hi>Offence</hi> contrary to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> rules, who take upon them determinately to impoſe unneceſſary rites by which they know many good Men will be <hi>Scandalized,</hi> but this is not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſs to diſcourſe of, tho I cannot forbear ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two things, which I think very eaſie to make out.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That our Church of <hi>England</hi> hath taken all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable care not to give any juſt offence to any ſort of perſons, and the offences that have been ſince taken at ſome things in our Conſtitution could not poſſibly have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:332"/> been foreſeen by thoſe who made our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from Popery, and ſo they could not be any reaſon againſt the firſt eſtabliſhment: Nor,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Are they now a ſufficient reaſon for the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; unleſs we can imagine it reaſonable to alter publick Laws made with great wiſdom and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as often, as they are diſliked by, or prove <hi>Offenſive</hi> to private perſons. If this be admitted, there then can never be any ſetled Government and order in the Church; becauſe there never can be any eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that will not be lyable to give ſuch <hi>Offence.</hi> They who now take <hi>Offence</hi> at what the Church of <hi>England</hi> enjoyns, on the ſame or a like account will take <hi>Offence</hi> at whatever can be enjoyned, and the ſame pretences of <hi>Scandal</hi> will be good againſt any eſtabliſhment they themſelves ſhall make; for tho they will not uſe theſe reaſons againſt their own eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet in a ſhort time others will take up their weapons to fight againſt them, and what ſerved to deſtroy the preſent Church will be as effectual to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that, which ſhall be ſet up in its room: ſo that whatever alteration is made, if this be allowed for a ſufficient ground of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to avoid the <hi>Offence</hi> that ſome men take at the preſent conſtitution, yet ſtill we ſhall be but where we were, and new <hi>Offences</hi> will ariſe, and ſo there muſt be continual changing and altering, to gratifie the unreaſonable humours and fancies of Men; and ſhould any one party of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters amongſt us get their Form of Government and Worſhip eſtabliſhed by Law, I doubt not but they would Preach to us the very ſame Doctrine, we do now to them. They would tell us that private perſons muſt bend and conform to the Laws, and not the Laws to private perſons; that it was our own fault that we were <hi>Offended;</hi> that our <hi>weakneſs</hi> proceeded from our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:333"/> unwillingneſs to receive inſtruction; that the <hi>weak</hi> were to be governed, not to preſcribe to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; that we muſt not expect that what was with good reaſon appointed and ordered ſhould be preſently abrogated or changed out of complyance with Mens fooliſh prejudices and miſtakes. It is ſufficiently known how ſtrict and rigorous botht the Presbyterians and Independents are and have been where they have had any advantage, and what little conſideration or regard they have had of their <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> tho they would have us ſo tender of them.</p>
                        <p>Thus much I think ſufficient to ſhew that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Obedience to Superiours in things Lawful is more obligatory, than the Precept of avoiding <hi>Scandal;</hi> whence it follows that it is our duty to obey in ſuch inſtances, tho <hi>Offence</hi> may be taken at it, becauſe no ſin is to be committed for the avoiding <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I might from this head further argue, that if we muſt not commit any ſin to avoid giving <hi>Offence,</hi> then it is not Lawful to Separate from our Pariſh-Churches upon that account; becauſe all voluntary Separation from a Church, in which nothing that is unlawful is required as a condition of Communion, is the ſin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and that is a ſin of the blackeſt dye and greateſt guilt, noted the in <hi>Scriptures</hi> for <hi>an act of carnality, a work of the Fleſh and of the Devil;</hi> for the neceſſity of our coming to Church, and Worſhipping God in the ſame publick place with our Neighbours, and ſubmitting to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſcipline and Cuſtoms of that particular Church we live in, doth not depend only upon the Statutes of the Realm which enforce it, and the Command of the Civil Magiſtrate who requires it; but by the Law of our Religion all needleſs Separation or Diviſion amongſt Chriſtians, breaking into little Parties and Factions, <hi>from whence comes ſtrife, envying, confuſion</hi>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:333"/> 
                           <hi>and every evil work,</hi> is to be moſt carefully avoided, as the very bane of Chriſtianity, the rending of Chriſts body, and as utterly deſtructive not only of the peace, but of the being of a Church. So that ſhould all the Laws about Conformity and againſt Conventicles be reſcinded and voided, ſhould the Magiſtrate indulge or connive at the Separate Aſſemblies, yet ſtill this would not make our joyning with them not to be ſinful. Since to preſerve the unity of Chriſtians and one Communion, is the neceſſary duty of every member of the Church, and it can never be thought a juſtifiable thing, to cut off our ſelves from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church or the Body of Chriſt, out of complyance with any erring or ignorant Brethren. But the ſinfulneſs of withdrawing from the Communion of our Church, either totally or in part, hath been ſo evidently ſhewn in ſome late diſcourſes written on that ſubject, that I do deſpair of convincing thoſe of the danger of it, who can withſtand the force of all that hath been already offered to them: I only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus much, that there is far more of the ſin of uncharitableneſs in ſuch Separation and Diviſion, than there can be in all the <hi>Offence</hi> that is imagined to be given by our Conformity.</p>
                        <p>From what I have already at large diſcourſed it plainly follows, that they are things meerly <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> not only in their own nature, but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us, in the uſe of which we are obliged to conſider the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our Brethren. What is our duty muſt be done, tho <hi>Scandal</hi> follow it: What is evil and ſinful ought to be left undone upon the ſcore of a greater obligation, than that of <hi>Scandal;</hi> but now in matters, wherein our practiſe is not determined by any Command, we ought ſo to exerciſe our liberty, as if poſſible to avoid giving any <hi>Offence</hi> to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:334"/> This is an undoubted part of that charity, which one Chriſtian ought always to be ready to ſhew to another, by admonition, inſtruction, good example, and by the forbearance of things Lawful, at which he foreſeeth his Neighbour out of <hi>weakneſs</hi> will be apt to be <hi>Scandalized,</hi> to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his falling into any ſin or miſchief; and this we teach and preſs upon our People as much as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters themſelves can, in obedience to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rules about <hi>meats and days,</hi> things neither in themſelves good or evil, nor determined by any Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were every way a proper inſtance, wherein Chriſtians might exerciſe their charity and compaſſion one to the other; and in ſuch caſes St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, that he would rather wholly forego his liberty, than by theſe indifferences endanger the Soul of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in that famous place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>If meat make my Brother to offend, I will eat no Fleſh while the World ſtandeth, leſt I make my Brother to Offend;</hi> where by <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>meat</hi> is to be underſtood ſuch as had been Offered unto <hi>Idols,</hi> which tho lawful for a Chriſtian to eat at common meals, yet the Apoſtle would wholly abſtain from, rather than wound the weak Conſcience of a Brother. <hi>If I by the Law of charity</hi> (as the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Taylour</hi> ſaith, <hi>Great exemp.</hi> p. 420) <hi>muſt rather quit my own goods than ſuffer my Brother to periſh, much rather muſt I quit my priviledg.</hi> And, <hi>We ſhould ill die for our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who will not loſe a meal to prevent his ſin, or change a diſh to ſave his Soul; and if the thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to us, yet it ought not to be indifferent to us whether our Brother live or die.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this manner do we profeſs our ſelves ready to do or forbear any thing in our own power, to win and gain our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> to the Church. We
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52190:334"/> grant that thoſe, who conform, are obliged by: this Law of charity not needleſly to vex and exaſperate our <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> nor to do any thing which they are not bound to do, that may eſtrange them more from the Church; but to reſtrain themſelves in the uſe of that liberty God and the Laws have left them, for the ſake of peace and out of condeſcenſion to their Brethren. We dare not indeed omit any duty we owe to God, or our Superiours either in Church or State, nor can we think it fit and reaſonable, that our Apoſtolical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Excellent Liturgy, Orderly Worſhip of God uſed in our Church, ſhould all be preſently condemned and laid aſide, as ſoon as ſome <hi>Weak</hi> men take <hi>Offence</hi> at them; but in all other things, ſubject to our own ordering and diſpoſal, we acknowledge our ſelves bound <hi>to pleaſe our Brother for his good unto Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I only add here, that this very rule of yielding to our Brother in things indifferent and undetermined ought to have ſome reſtrictions and limitations, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of which are mentioned by Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi> whom I have ſo often named; as Firſt, That we are not to forbear theſe indifferent things, where there is only a poſſibility of <hi>Scandal,</hi> but where the <hi>Scandal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent is probable; for otherwiſe <hi>we ſhould be at an utter loſs and uncertainty in all our actions, and never know what to do.</hi> Secondly, Our <hi>weak</hi> Brethren muſt have ſome probable ground for their imagination that what we do is evil and ſinful, or elſe we muſt wear no Ribbands, nor put off our Hats, but come all to <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee;</hi> and for this exception he gives this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial reaſon, <hi>that if we are to abſtain from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, in which another without probable ground imagineth that there is ſin, the ſervitude of Chriſtians under the Goſpel would be far greater and</hi>
                           <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:335"/> 
                           <hi>more intolerable, than that of the Jews under the Moſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical adminiſtration.</hi> Thirdly, This muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of indifferent things that are of no very great importance; for if it be a matter of ſome weight and moment, as yielding me ſome great profit, I muſt only for a while forbear it, untill my Brother is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed. Laſtly, We muſt not wholly betray our Chriſtian liberty to pleaſe peeviſh and froward people, or to humour our Neighbour in an erroneous and ſuperſtitious opinion; for which he quotes Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> who in his Comment upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. tells of ſome <hi>fooliſh Interpreters, that leave to Chriſtians almoſt no uſe at all of things indifferent, upon pretence to avoid the Offence of Superſtitious perſons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now tho all this is generally true, yet I think there are no certain unalterable rules to be laid down to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our practiſe in this affair. For it being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of charity, muſt be determined by the meaſures of prudence according to circumſtances, and we may as well go about to give certain rules for Mens charity in other caſes, and fix the proportion, which every Man ought to give of his eſtate towards the relief of the poor, as poſitively to tell how far a Man muſt deny himſelf in the uſe of indifferent things, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go his own liberty for the ſake of his Brother, and ſo I end this head with thoſe words of the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his little Treatiſe of <hi>Scandal: This whole matter is to be referred to the Chriſtians pious diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or prudence, it being free to him either to abſtain, or not to abſtain, from any indifferent action (remaining ſuch) according as that piety, and that prudence ſhall repreſent it to be moſt charitable and beneficial to other Mens Souls.</hi> Thus I have done with the firſt propoſition, that nothing ſinful is to be committed to avoid <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing</hi> others.</p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52190:335"/>
                        <p>2. I proceed now to the Second, that to avoid a leſs <hi>Scandal</hi> being taken by a few we muſt not give a greater <hi>Offence,</hi> and of vaſtly more pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to a much bigger number of perſons: Not that ſuch a caſe can ever happen, wherein we muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily give <hi>juſt Offence</hi> to one ſide or other, and ſo are uncharitable, whether we do or forbear to do the ſame action; for then we ſhould be under a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which implies a contradiction, but yet it may and often doth happen, that ſome <hi>weak</hi> perſons may take <hi>Offence</hi> at my doing, and others be more <hi>Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> at my forbearing to do the ſame thing, and thus whether I do it, or not, I ſhall give <hi>Offence,</hi> tho not juſtly, nor through my own fault, to ſome one or other. In ſuch circumſtances therefore we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, which way is given the greater and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>Offence,</hi> and it can never be either prudence or charity to abſtain from that, which may <hi>Scandalize</hi> our Brother, when by forbearance a greater and more publick <hi>Scandal</hi> is miniſtred to others; for in this caſe <hi>we have greater reaſon on the account of Scandal it ſelf to do, than to forbear that action,</hi> as all that write on this ſubject do and muſt acknowledge, and for which they uſually quote that ſaying of <hi>Bernard, Prudenter advertendum eſt ſcandalum ſcandalo non emendari, &amp;c. We are prudently to mark that one Scandal is not mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another; which kind of emendation we ſhould practiſe, if to take off offence from one party, we give offence unto another.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was the occaſion of that famous Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two great Apoſtles mentioned in the ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> had freely converſed with the Gentile Chriſtians, and had eat with them all kind of meats; but afterwards when certain believing Jews from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were ſtill
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52190:336"/> Zealous for <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the diſtinction of meats, came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> out of fear of <hi>Offending</hi> them and occaſioning their falling off from the Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> he abſtained from that liberty, and withdrew from that converſation, which before he had without any ſcruple uſed; and all the believing <hi>Jews</hi> that were at <hi>Antioch</hi> followed his example, and ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Gentile Brethren. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> conſidering the greater <hi>Scandal</hi> and miſchief, that would follow this pretended tenderneſs of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his complyance with the Jewiſh Chriſtians, and that it was a likely way not only to confirm them in their error, but alſo wholly to exclude the Gentiles from the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo to hinder Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being propagated in the World, he <hi>withſtood</hi> Peter <hi>to the face,</hi> and chid him ſharply for his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent behaviour, who to avoid <hi>offending</hi> ſome of the <hi>weak</hi> Jews did give a far greater <hi>Offence,</hi> and of much more dangerous conſequence to the Gentile Converts, of whom the Chriſtian Church was chiefly to conſiſt. In this caſe therefore of <hi>Scandal</hi> we are not only to regard one ſide or party of Men, but as the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>We muſt give none offence neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It would ſwell this diſcourſe much beyond my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign to ſet forth at large the many and great <hi>Scandals,</hi> which are given by thoſe, who Separate from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and I doubt not but if this matter was rightly conſidered, and we were but impartially careful to avoid giving all <hi>Offence</hi> to others, we ſhould ſoon find our ſelves much more obliged upon this account of <hi>Scandal</hi> peaceably to communicate with our Church, than to continue divided from it. I ſhall hint at ſome few of the moſt obvious conſiderations,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52190:336"/> by which we may a little Judge which way the greater <hi>Scandal</hi> is given.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By leaving the Pariſh-Churches and joyning to the Separate Aſſemblies, we do mightily eſtabliſh and harden (as I have before obſerved) thoſe Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with whom we aſſociate, in their ſinful Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Erroneous perſuaſion of the unlawfulneſs of conformity; for it is but reaſonable with them to judge, that we do the ſame things for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with themſelves; and this is the true <hi>Scandalizing</hi> of our <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> leading them into, o confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in an evil courſe: Whereas by our forſaking them and returning to the Church we may poſſibly incline ſome, that are ſincere amongſt them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and ſuſpect their own way, and enquire after the Arguments that prevail with us to conform, and they may begin to think that there is not ſo much evil in it as they have all along ſuppoſed, and thus our Authority or example may contribute ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the gaining our Brethren.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Which alſo I have juſt mentioned before, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sect or denomination of Diſſenters we joyn with, we <hi>Offend</hi> all the other Sects or Parties amongſt them: for they agree only in their oppoſition to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but in other things they have their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Forms and Models of Worſhip, and Shibboleths, and they think as ill, and ſometimes ſpeak as hardly of one another, as they do of Conformiſts. Which would evidently appear, if any one ſort of them ſhould get the upper hand; the reſt of them would all act as fiercely, and complain as loudly of that Party that did prevail, as they now do of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Till therefore they all agree in one way and ſpeak the ſame Language there is no reaſon why any one Sect of them ſhould challenge our condeſcenſion to them,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52190:337"/> to the diſſatisfaction and <hi>Offence</hi> of all the other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, who have as good a right to this Plea of <hi>weakneſs</hi> as themſelves.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hereby great <hi>Offence</hi> is given to all thoſe who do conform; for this Separation from the Church is a publick condemning of the Government, Orders, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline or Doctrine of our Church, and is apt to breed ſcruples and perplexities in well meaning, but leſs knowing members of it, and by degrees produces a diſtaſt or diſlike of our Worſhip, and plainly hinders the efficacy of the ordinances of Chriſt as adminiſtred in our Church, whileſt it creates prejudices in people againſt them as impure and corrupt; and why there ſhould not be a due regard had to thoſe many, who are <hi>Offended</hi> at our Diſſenters Conventicle Worſhip, as well as of thoſe, who are ſaid to be <hi>Scandalized</hi> by our Church ſervice, I cannot at all gueſs. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay here, that irreverent ſitting at the receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, Mens unmannerly wearing their Hats in time of Divine Worſhip, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes putting them off but half way at their Prayers, their indecent poſtures and antick geſtures at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, the extravagancies and follies (not to ſay worſe) ſome of them are guilty of in their extemporary effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſtrange uncouth Metaphors and Phraſes they uſe in their Preaching; in a word, the ſlovenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Divine Worſhip amongſt the Diſſenters is much more <hi>Scandalous,</hi> then all the Ceremonies of our Church can ever be.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Conſider the <hi>Scandal</hi> that is hereby given to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and our Superiours, by bringing their Laws and Authority into contempt; concerning which the forenamed Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> in his firſt Edition of his Diſcourſe about <hi>Abſtinence from all Appearance of Evil,</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it were better to be thrown</hi>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52190:337"/> 
                           <hi>into the bottom of the Sea with a Millſtone about ones Neck, than to offend a little one, a poor and illiterate Artizan, what expreſſion ſhall we then find anſwerable to the heinouſneſs of a Scandal given to a Pious Magiſtrate, to a Religious Prince, to a Parliament, and Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to an whole Church and Commonwealth?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. By this Separation from the Church, great <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> is given to the Papiſts; not that they are diſpleaſed at it; they are not indeed offended in that ſenſe, but this ſerves wonderfully to harden them in their falſe and Idolatrous Worſhip; it increaſeth their confidence, that their Church is the only true Church of Chriſt, becauſe amongſt them only is found Peace and Unity; and this is a mighty temptation to many wavering Chriſtians to turn Papiſts: inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath told us, that <hi>Thouſands have been drawn to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, or confirmed in it by this Argument already,</hi> and he ſaith of himſelf, that <hi>he is perſuaded, that all the Arguments elſe in</hi> Bellarmin, <hi>and all other Books that ever were written, have not done ſo much to make Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in</hi> England, <hi>as the multitude of Sects among our ſelves.</hi> This indeed is a great <hi>Scandal</hi> to our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and is that which the Papiſts are on all occaſions ſo forward to object againſt us, and hit us in the teeth with; and by our hearty uniting with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we may certainly wreſt out of their hands the moſt dangerous weapon they uſe againſt the Reformation.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. This tends to the <hi>Scandal</hi> of Religion in general. It prejudiceth men againſt it as an uncertain thing, a matter of endleſs diſpute and debate; it makes ſome Men utterly reject it as conſiſting moſtly in little trifles and niceties about which they obſerve the greateſt noiſe and contention to be made or as deſtructive of the Publick Peace of Societies, when they ſee what
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52190:338"/> dangerous feuds and quarrels commence from our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Differences, and all the diſorder and confuſion that they have cauſed here in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall by ſome be charged upon Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Thus our cauſeleſs Separations and Diviſions open a wide door to Atheiſme, and all kind of Prophaneneſs and Irreligion: After this manner it was of old, and always will be, where there are Parties in Religion, and one contends that their Separation is lawful, and the other that it is unlawful, the Common people ſoon become doubtful and ready to forſake all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                        <p>I might add here, that ſuch Separations neceſſarily occaſion breach of Charity; they beget implacable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and animoſities: Hence cometh ſtrife, emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, envying, one Party continually endeavouring to overtop the other, watching for one anothers halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rejoycing in one anothers ſins and misfortunes, conſtant undermining one another, to the diſturbance of the Publick Government, and endangering the Civil Peace; of all which and much more than I can now mention the preſent diſtracted condition of our Nation is ſo great and undenyable an evidence, that there need no more words to ſhew the miſchiefs that attend ſuch Diviſions; and now let any one judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Peace and Unity of the Church, the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Charity amongſt Brethren, the keeping out Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Atheiſm, the preſervation of the Authority of the Magiſtrate, and quiet of the Society we are Members of, the honour and credit of our Religion. Laſtly, Whether giving <hi>Offence</hi> to all both Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and Nonconformiſts, thoſe only excepted of our own particular Sect and Diviſion, nay <hi>Scandalizing</hi> them alſo in the true and proper ſenſe of <hi>Scandal,</hi> be not of far greater and more weighty conſideration,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52190:338"/> than the fear of diſpleaſing or grieving ſome few <hi>weak</hi> diſſatisfied Brethren; <hi>Wo to thoſe, by whom Offences come.</hi> But theſe things I have very lightly touched, becauſe they have been the ſubject of many Sermons and diſcourſes lately publiſhed.</p>
                        <p>To ſum up all I have ſaid,</p>
                        <p>Since they, who diſſent from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are not ſuch <hi>weak</hi> perſons as St. <hi>Paul</hi> all along deſcribes and provides for; ſince we cannot by our Conformity really <hi>Scandalize</hi> or <hi>Offend</hi> them in that ſenſe, in which the Scriptures uſe thoſe words; ſince tho we did give <hi>Offence</hi> to them by our Conformity, yet that would not excuſe us from doing our Duty, and by refuſing to Conform we ſhould do both them and others greater hurt and miſchief; I think I may ſafely conclude, that <hi>there cannot lie any obligation upon any private Chriſtian (as the caſe now ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us) to abſent himſelf from his Pariſh-Church, or to forbear the uſe of the Forms of Prayer or Ceremonies by Law appointed, for fear of Offending his weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I end all with one word of Advice. Firſt, to thoſe who are not convinced of the lawfulneſs of Conformity. Secondly, to thoſe who are ſatisfied that it is lawful.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To thoſe who are not convinced of the lawfulneſs of Conformity, and therefore urge ſo hard that they ought not to be <hi>Offended</hi> by us. I would beſeech them that they would take ſome care and make ſome Conſcience to avoid giving any needleſs <hi>Offence</hi> to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and this cannot but be thought a reaſonable requeſt, ſince they require all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be ſo tender of them. They ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to meet in ſuch numbers, nor at the ſame time at which we aſſemble to Worſhip God in our publick Churches. Let them not affront our Service and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52190:339"/> nor revile our Biſhops and Miniſters, nor put on their Hats when at any time they chance to be preſent at our Service in our Churches, nor talk nor read in Books, nor make ſour faces at our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and when they obſerve theſe and other the like rules, they may then with a better grace (tho with little reaſon) find fault with our Conformity as <hi>Offenſive</hi> to them. I would be loth to ſay any thing, that ſhould exaſperate or provoke any of the Diſſenters whoſe ſatisfaction I deſign: I very well know their <hi>weakneſs,</hi> that they cannot endure to be told of their faults. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I muſt tell them, that there are no ſort of perſons in the Chriſtian World profeſſing Religion and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that have done ſuch <hi>Scandalous</hi> things, as ſome of thoſe who call themſelves Proteſtant Diſſenters. I forbear to name particulars.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As for thoſe who are ſatisfied concerning the lawfulneſs of Conformity, I would deſire them ſo to order their return to the Church, as not to give any juſt <hi>Offence</hi> to thoſe whom they forſake; that is to ſay, that they would do it heartily and ſincerely, that all may ſee they Conformed with a willing mind, being perſuaded that it is their duty ſo to do, and not meerly to ſatisfie the Law, or to ſave their Purſes, or to get into an Office, or to capacitate them to Vote or the like. For ſuch a kind of Conformity, as ſome practiſe, and call <hi>Occaſional Communion,</hi> which is coming to Church and Sacrament to ſerve a turn, is truly <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi> to all good Men of what perſuaſion ſoever.</p>

                        <p>THere are very few things within the Sphere of Chriſtian Religion, that more trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the thoughts of men, than how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves, and order their actions with reſpect to things that are called <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In things that are eſſentially good or evil, or are made ſo by ſome plain Command or Prohibition of our great Law giver, all Parties are ſoon agreed; and there needs not any queſtion or diſpute between them in theſe: The Rule is plain, and (ſuppoſing men honeſt) there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any great miſtake about them.</p>
                        <p>But in things that are left wholly undetermined by God, and neither directly, nor by juſt and natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence either enjoyned or prohibited by any Law of his, there men ſail not by ſo plain a Compaſs, but have a larger Scope, and may more eaſily miſtake their Courſe.</p>
                        <p>It cannot therefore be leſs than a good ſervice to men,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:343"/> to direct them ſafely in this Unbeaten track, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them ſuch Rules, to which if they carefully attend, they can never fall into any dangerous errour.</p>
                        <p>This is our Apoſtles charitable deſign in this Chapter; to which I ſhall have a reſpect in managing this preſent Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and by governing our ſelves by the meaſures of his diſcourſe in it, we may be able to hit thoſe great Rules of our actions in theſe things.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtles diſcourſe is indeed but of one particular inſtance of theſe, <hi>i e.</hi> the eating, or not eating things that had Leen offered in Sacrifice by the Gentiles to their <hi>Daemons;</hi> which I ſhall have occaſion to explain at large hereafter to you.</p>
                        <p>But it is equally applicable to all things of the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different nature. And there are two Rules laid down by him there, which men ought to govern themſelves by in the uſe of ſuch things.</p>
                        <p>1. The Firſt is the Glory of God, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Whatſoever therefore ye do, whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God;</hi> i. e. whatever ye do in theſe things, be ſure you have reſpect to the Law and Will of God, and take heed that you violate none of the divine Commandments, either by what you do, or what you refuſe to do in things of this nature. For this is the true notion and meaning of <hi>doing all to the glory of God,</hi> i. e. Keeping us cloſe to the obſervance of thoſe Laws and Rules that he hath commanded us. For then God is moſt truly glorified by us, when we expreſs a great ſenſe of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Laws in all that we do. But this by the way.</p>
                        <p>The 2d Rule is Charity, and reſpect to the benefit and advantage of thoſe we converſe with, and live among; that we neither grieve nor injure them by any thing that we do, or neglect to do: and this is the meaning of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:343"/> theſe words, ſo often quoted by our diſſenting Brethren: <hi>Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is that Rule of our actions in all indifferent things, which I have choſen to conſider in this diſcourſe: and the rather, becauſe we have ſome conteſt with our diſſenting Brethren about it.</p>
                        <p>There hath been great talk about Scandal and giving Offence to weak and tender Conſciences, by Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Compliance with all thoſe things which the Church of <hi>England</hi> requires in her Liturgie: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the other Arguments and Pretences againſt it, this hath been preſt to ſerve in the Cauſe, either to add ſome real weight to the reſt, or at leaſt to add to their number.</p>
                        <p>Though (to tell you plainly) I think it is onely to make a ſhew, and to render the bulk of their Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the bigger, that this is ſummoned to the Muſter, and not for any real weight that there is in it to ſerve the Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>However, whatever there is in it, a great noiſe is made with it; and as a mighty noiſe hath been made about Scandal, and great pains uſed to wreſt the notion of it to ſerve mens purpoſes in theſe things: ſo great art hath been employed to accommodate it to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to fright men with the guilt and danger of it, from complying with the Inſtitutions of the Church, which (as is pretended) are ſo very great a Scandal and Offence to weak Conſciences.</p>
                        <p>Two great and popular Pleas againſt the Liturgie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Ceremonies retained by it, have been theſe: tenderneſs and ſcruples of Conſcience, in ſome; and fear of Scandal and giving Offence to ſuch, in others.</p>
                        <p>Some men have pleaded their own Scruples, and want
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:344"/> of ſufficient Conviction and Information, and excuſed their omiſſion of theſe things, from that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſome have alledged their fear of Scandal and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending others, and pleaded that in bar of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, from theſe words of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Give none offence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>How much the ſence of the firſt place is miſtaken, and how falſe the conſequence that is made from it is, I am not now obliged to ſhew. My Province at this time is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſecond, this place that I have now quoted: in order to which, I intend to do theſe two things.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Shew that this place is not at all concerned in our preſent Queſtion, nor will ſerve that purpoſe that the Diſſenters from our Church alledge it for.</item>
                           <item>2. That if it were, it would conclude againſt them and their practice, in the preſent Caſe betwixt us.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. I begin with the firſt, which is to ſhew, that this place is not concerned in our preſent Caſe, nor pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged by our Brethren againſt their Conformity to the preſent Rites and Uſages of the Church.</p>
                        <p>And this I might do, from two things miſtaken great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the application of this Text.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The true notion of <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Offence</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</item>
                           <item>2. The nature of the things to which it is applied, which is vaſtly different from what men ſcruple or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear in our Caſe.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. From the true notion of <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Offence</hi> that is mentioned in this place, and in many other places in the New Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>I do not intend here a large Diſcourſe of the nature of Scandal in the general, or a removing and rectifying thoſe many common miſtakes in the world about it; but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:344"/> only to obſerve ſo much as will be ſufficient to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Then I obſerve, that as there are onely two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scandal in the New Teſtament, ſo there are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Caſes in which men are properly and primarily capable of being guilty of it, I mean in giving it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The firſt notion of Scandal is, That it is a Snare or a Gin, by which men are intrapped and drawn into ſome plain ſin and wickedneſs. In which ſence it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in many places, and particularly in that famous Speech of our Saviours, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 6. to 10.</p>
                        <p>And men do then give offence, or ſcandalize others, when they do that which directly and in its own nature tends to induce others either to do that which God hath forbidden, and is a ſin; or omit that which he hath commanded, and is a plain Duty: both which men may do ſeveral ways, which it is not now ſo very needful to reckon up ſingly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond notion of Scandal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is, That it is ſome juſt cauſe of grief or trouble to others in their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an courſe, and that which hinders them from walking in it with that chearfulneſs and ſecurity that they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would.</p>
                        <p>According to which ſence it is rendred <hi>Offence</hi> in this, and many other Texts of Scripture, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome juſt cauſe of offence, of trouble or grief given to another by ſomething that he ſees us either omit, or do.</p>
                        <p>In this ſence it is uſed in many places of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, not for that which is a direct occaſion of another mans ſin, but a juſt cauſe of his grief and ſorrow, and diſcouragement in the way of Duty: So it is uſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 1. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. it is expreſſed by <hi>grieving.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in this ſence men give offence to others, when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:345"/> either by doing, or neglecting ſomething themſelves, they give juſt cauſe of ſorrow or grief to others, and diſcourage them in their Chriſtian courſe, and occaſion to them ſome trouble and grief of mind, that otherwiſe might be free from.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Having obſerved this therefore, I proceed in the ſecond place to obſerve, that neither of theſe notions of Scandal can be accommodated to our preſent caſe; nor can we be ſaid to give offence to others, in either of theſe ſences, by conforming to the Inſtitutions and Rites of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Not in the firſt ſence; for that can onely be in one, or both of theſe two caſes: either firſt, by doing that which is eſſentially and in its own nature evil and a ſin; Or ſecondly, by doing that which is directly a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a ſnare to induce another to do that which is a ſin.</p>
                        <p>Now if it can be ſhewn, that complying with the Rites and Service of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is giving offence in either of theſe ſences, then I here profeſs, I will my ſelf immediately turn their Proſelyte, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Conformity, and proteſt againſt it for ever.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It hath ſcarce ever yet been ſo much as intimated, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> requires any thing as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Communion with her, that is eſſentially evil. None of our adverſaries (that I know of) have yet dared to charge her Doctrine with falſhood, or her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline with any thing that is in it ſelf evil: And when any ſhall adventure to do it, I doubt not but he will find enough to enter the liſts with him.</p>
                        <p>Even our bittereſt Enemies of the Romiſh Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion have dared to charge us no further in either of theſe, but onely that we are defective in both, and reject many things which the Church of Chriſt (as they pretend) hath believed and practiſed in the ancient and primitive ages of it.</p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:345"/>
                        <p>They would rather chuſe to call us Schiſmaticks, than Hereticks, or to prove us Hereticks; not becauſe we believe or teach any things for neceſſary Doctrines which are falſe, but rather becauſe we do not teach or believe all things that are Chriſtian and true.</p>
                        <p>Neither do they charge our Liturgy, and Service, or Form of Worſhip, with any thing that is materially e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, no nor redundant, but onely deficient in many Uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Rites, which they pretend to be Apoſtolical. And if our own Brethren muſt be more ſpightful and bitter againſt us than our worſt Adverſaries, let them look to it, that even they become not their accuſers at the great day.</p>
                        <p>But yet (thanks be to God) they have not adventured to do this, and will be unſucceſsful enough when they do it; and therefore themſelves free us from giving any offence in our Conformity, in this ſence of giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>i. e.</hi> doing any thing which is formally a Sin our ſelves, and thereby inducing others into the ſame evil by joyning with us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Neither ſecondly do I ſee any one ſin, that Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is directly introductive of, or a temptation unto; and I will believe it will puzzle the moſt curious and inquiſitive to find out any ſuch.</p>
                        <p>I have ſo much charity for my dear Mother the Church, and ſo much duty (I thank God) yet left in me, as to dare to juſtifie her from this imputation. I am ſure ſhe intends no ſin in what ſhe doth, nor knowns of any evil, that her Communion will betray any man into.</p>
                        <p>All that ſhe deſigns in her Doctrine, is to teach <hi>the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and to keep cloſe to that <hi>Symbol of Faith, which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And what ſhe intends and aims at in her Liturgie and Diſcipline, is by the one to keep men from innovating
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:346"/> and corrupting that Faith, or debauching it in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and deteining it in unrighteouſneſs: And by the other, to direct them to worſhip God in ſuch a way, as is ſuitable to his own nature, and to the Principles of ſuch a holy Religion; and thereby conciliate that grace that may enable them to live ſo, as the Worſhip of ſuch a God, and the Belief of ſuch a Religion require, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to do.</p>
                        <p>I muſt confeſs, in one thing the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be an occaſion of a great deal of ſin in the world; but it is ſuch as will as little advantage our Brethren to have it granted, as it will be any diſparagement, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to be cauſed by it.</p>
                        <p>I mean, in being an occaſion of all that in and guilt that all thoſe bring upon themſelves, that rail and cry out ſo much upon it; that ſeparate and divide from it, and ſtudiouſly maintain and keep up an unreaſonable and downright Schiſm againſt it.</p>
                        <p>But certainly all men will ſee that this is an offence onely taken, and not given; and ought no more to be objected againſt the Church, than Murther and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Theft and Robbery ought to be charged upon the Laws of God, that declare the ſame to be ſin. Were there no ſuch thing as the Conſtitution of a Church, theſe men would not be guilty of Schiſm, and unjuſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from it. But ſo, if there were no Law, there would be no tranſgreſſion; and Adulterers may as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Law for their ſin in one caſe, as Schiſmaticks can accuſe the Conſtitution of the Church in the other. They are both in this caſe equally culpable, <hi>i. e.</hi> indeed not at all.</p>
                        <p>In a word, and to conclude this Period; if Piety, and becoming expreſſions of Devotion in the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: If Gravity, Decency, and Order in the Offices of Religion; And if engaging men to a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:346"/> and regard to the rules of the Goſpel, be ſins or evils to be eſchewed and dreaded by men; then I will grant that Conformity to the Church of <hi>England</hi> may poſſibly give offence (in this ſence of giving of it) but if not, I do not ſee any reaſon to apprehend or fear any danger at all of it.</p>
                        <p>By theſe conſiderations it will appear, we are free from giving offence by our Conformity to the Rules of our Church, in this firſt ſence of Scandal and giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I proceed therefore now to enquire, if we cannot clear our ſelves ſufficiently from it in the ſecond notion of theſe things alſo.</p>
                        <p>And this I think will beſt and moſt plainly be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, by conſidering what can be thought juſt cauſe of ſorrow and grief to a good man, or a reaſonable diſcouragement or hinderance to him in his way of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I mean ſtill, cauſe of theſe given to him by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe, I think, I may reduce pretty ſafely to theſe three Heads.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Some diſhonour offered to God and his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>
                           <item>2. The Wickedneſs and Profaneneſs of men.</item>
                           <item>3. The making the way of Religion and Duty more cumberſome, and difficult than otherwiſe it would be.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Theſe are great and juſt cauſes of offence and grief to a good man. It cannot but greatly afflict a good man to behold his God (whom he adores, and honours, and loves above all things) affronted and diſhonoured, his Laws violated, his Authority contemned and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon by daring and fooliſh men: <hi>Rivers of waters</hi>
                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:347"/> (ſaith the holy Pſalmiſt) <hi>run down mine eyes, becauſe men keep not thy law.</hi> Pſal. 119. 136.</p>
                        <p>And it cannot but be cauſe of the like ſorrow to ſuch a man, to ſee other men, for whom he hath a great and concerning charity, and whom he loves as his own ſoul, to live in ſin, and a contempt of God, to wound and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their precious Souls, and to provide matter for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments.</p>
                        <p>And any thing that diſcourageth a man in the way of his Duty, or renders it more perplexed and troubleſome to him, may be juſtly called an offence or grief to him. I do not eaſily underſtand how this kind of offence can properly be ſaid to be given any other, but by ſome of theſe ways.</p>
                        <p>Now let our debate be determined by theſe things, and let the iſſue be, Whether Conformity can be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving others upon any of theſe accounts.</p>
                        <p>It cannot, I am ſure, be ſaid, or at leaſt nothing like a proof be offered, that we offend men hereby, becauſe we either do any diſhonour to God, or to his holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by it: It is much truer, that we bring honour and reputation to both by it.</p>
                        <p>To God, by taking the beſt courſe we can pitch upon to ſecure the Solemnity and Decency of his Worſhip: And to Religion, by taking care that all the great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it be performed decently and to edification, and not profaned by the ignorance, or temerity of every bold and unskilful undertaker.</p>
                        <p>2. Nor ſecondly can it be pretended that hereby we let men be ſpectators of our wickedneſs and profaneneſs, and ſo grieve and make ſad the hearts of good men, while they ſee us without any fear of God before our eyes.</p>
                        <p>I have that charity for the modeſty and integrity of our Diſſenting Brethren, that they will not call our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:347"/> Idolatry, and the ſervice of <hi>Baal</hi> any longer; though it cannot be diſſembled, that a great part of the leſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning Rabble have been taught by them, ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and think of it. But if any have been miſled into ſuch an Opinion, I would beg them to come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our way of publick Worſhip, for their better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
                        <p>3. No, nor thirdly do I ſee how it can be any offence upon its making the way of Religion and Duty more cumberſome, or difficult to others, than it would be.</p>
                        <p>It would be a hard matter for any to ſhew where he is hindred from being good, by ſeeing others conformable to the Church; or what obſtruction that caſts in his way of Duty. I will at any time undertake to ſhew, that it may be an help and advantage to him, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to him in the way of Religion and Salvation; but let or hinderance it can be none.</p>
                        <p>If it be pretended, that by this we make Religion cumberſome, and clog that with Rites and Ceremonies, that is a plain and eaſie thing; I grant the Objection were reaſonable, and the Charge of giving offence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, were it either ſo as it began to be of old in St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s time, or is at preſent in the Roman-Church, clogged with ſo many antick and gariſh Ceremonies, that it requires a great deal of ſtudy to be an exact Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiſt, and is a thouſand times harder to remember, and obſerve all the Rites and Modes of any Service and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Religion, than to do the thing a hundred times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                        <p>But let me beg men to conſider whether this Charge can be juſt againſt a Church and its Liturgy, which enjoyn but three Ceremonies, againſt which the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves can object, and theſe too not in the ſame, but ſo many diſtinct Services, and which are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than barely determining thoſe circumſtances
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:348"/> of Habit and Geſture, which are natural and neceſſary to all our actions.</p>
                        <p>If theſe things can be thought to make the Practice and Services of Religion burthenſome, then any of the Poſtures in which our Brethren perform their Worſhip will make that ſo too; and then the Directory will be as chargeable and faulty in this, as the Liturgy.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things will be ſufficient, upon this firſt way that I propoſed, to ſhew, that conforming to the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church is not concerned in any thing the Apoſtle ſpeaks in this place, nor can come under his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of giving offence to any, which he ſpeaks againſt in it.</p>
                        <p>I will not deny, but that ſome may be offended and troubled at it. It is too viſible how much ſome men are troubled to ſee a Church conſtituted among us; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it protected by Law and Power, and to ſee ſo great a deference and reſpect payd unto it, and its way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (as bleſſed be God is at preſent) by multitudes both of great and good men. I do not doubt but it is greatly maligned and envyed by men, and it is little leſs than a continual trouble and grief to them. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their private Intereſt, and ſo long as it is ſo, their deſigns and aims will never be effected.</p>
                        <p>But ſo ill men are troubled at a good Government; and Thieves and Robbers may be vexed that Honeſt men are ſecured from them; and theſe may as well cry out, that the Laws and the Government are an offence to them, as others may, that they are offended at the Church and Conformity.</p>
                        <p>Sure we know things better than to call every thing a Scandal that any man is vexed or troubled at: If we muſt acknowledge that an offence, or forbear doing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for fear of Scandal, that every ill deſigning man is pleaſed to take exceptions againſt; it is more than
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:348"/> probable we muſt do nothing at all, nor venture to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any thing, till we ſee whether all perſons will be pleaſed with it or not: We muſt not call every thing an offence that pleaſeth not the humour of every man; for then nothing can avoid that character.</p>
                        <p>But this is not enough to ſay in this matter; for it will ſerve us much further, not onely to juſtifie our ſelves from this imputation, but to reflect it back upon thoſe that charge us: For when we have well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, we ſhall find, that the Scandal will fall upon our Accuſers; and not Conformity, but Separation will be found to be the giving Offence, and that in both the notions of giving it that have been named.</p>
                        <p>Separation is indeed the Scandal, as being both an evil in it ſelf, and that which betrays others into many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
                        <p>If ever there were ſuch a thing as Schiſm in the world, or if the Separation of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> or any that were ever made from the Communion of a National Church were a Schiſm, I think it hath been ſufficiently proved on our behalf, that the preſent Separation from our Church is really a Schiſm.</p>
                        <p>And if Schiſm be a damnable ſin, (and ſo it is, if we will judge either by the Doctrines of the Apoſtles, or their beſt Succeſſors, yea and few ſins greater) then we ſhall need no other argument to prove Separation to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Scandal, and that in the greateſt notion of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal too.</p>
                        <p>And we ſadly ſee what great miſchiefs it is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of; what uncharitableneſs and railing, what pride and cenſoriouſneſs it betrays men into Schiſm was ſcarce ever content to be alone. Men think it not enough to ſeparate from the Communion of the Church, unleſs they go to juſtifie their Separation, by aſperſing what they ſeparated from; and ſo men are inevitably betrayed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:349"/> into envyings and bitter railings, into ſtrife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all thoſe evils that ſuch things are naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of.</p>
                        <p>And I am ſure it is a ſore grief and trouble, and an offence (in the ſecond notion of it) to many good men, who cannot but be grieved greatly.</p>
                        <p>To ſee the Inſtitutions of Chriſt ſo diſregarded, the great Duties and Services of Religion ſo ſlighted and neglected; and to behold the Peace and Welfare of the Church (which coſt the Saviour of the world ſo dear, and is ſo greatly beloved by him) ſo very little conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or rather purpoſely betrayed.</p>
                        <p>To behold men allow themſelves (nay glory) in ſuch damnable ſins; deſtroy their Souls by the guilt of them, and wilfully forfeit the benefit of all that Chriſt hath done, and ſuffered for them.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, to ſee the way of Religion ſo perplexed with idle Queſtions, and made intricate by needleſs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes; and to ſee ſo many unreaſonable Controverſies ſtarted, and ſuch eager Quarrels amongſt Chriſtians, which the beſt men ſometimes have much ado to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and get over ſo as they ſhould do.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the things that make many <hi>ſad,</hi> and aking <hi>hearts</hi> among thoſe <hi>whom God hath not made ſad,</hi> and theſe are the effects of the ſad Diviſions and Separations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. Theſe therefore are the Scandal, and the things that ſo much offend, and theſe are the <hi>Diviſions for which there are ſuch ſearchings of heart</hi> at this day.</p>
                        <p>I would to God ſome men would ſeriouſly conſider things, they might then poſſibly begin to reflect upon themſelves and their own actions, and perhaps ſee cauſe to take ſome part of that reproach upon themſelves, which they are pleaſed ſo prodigally to caſt upon us.</p>
                        <p>2. But I have another thing yet, to ſhew the errour of applying this Speech of the Apoſtle to our caſe:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:349"/> For as there is a miſtake in the notion of <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> ſo there is too, in thoſe things to which the <hi>giving offence</hi> here relates; and they are vaſtly different from thoſe things in the Church, that we conform unto, by which the offence is pretended to be given.</p>
                        <p>The difference I mean is this; that however they may be things in their own nature equally indifferent, yet the ſupervening command from lawful Authority may make a vaſt difference between them. Thoſe things to which this Text relates, were indifferent, and undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned too, no humane Law had taken cognizance of them; but the Inſtitutions or Ceremonies of the Church, in which it is pretended we give offence, are things already determined by the Laws of men, and ſuch as a lawful Authority hath bound us to the practice of.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not need to have any controverſie, I hope, with any about the nature of them; nor will any of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Outcries againſt them prove them eſſentially evil. Though ſome men have been taught to call them <hi>Rags of</hi> Rome, <hi>Inſtances of Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Relicks of Idolatry;</hi> theſe are words of courſe, and arts of railing, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim indeed the rancour and malice of ſome mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but do not change the nature of things. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſtranger that ſhould hear all this outcry, and at laſt find the things declaimed ſo againſt are but pure Modes and Circumſtances of things, he would either greatly queſtion the judgement and honeſty of ſome men; or at leaſt conclude, that a little thing will ſerve thoſe men to quarrel with, that are reſolved either to find faults, or to make them.</p>
                        <p>2. Nor ſecondly ſhall I need here to diſpute whether ſuch things may be injoyned by a lawful Authority in the Service of God: This hath been done fully already by a more learned hand; to which I have nothing here to adde, but that our Brethren, and all the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:350"/> of them, do the ſame thing themſelves, and ſufficiently confute their own Objection. So hard is it for them to frame any argument againſt us, which may not like a two-edged weapon wound themſelves.</p>
                        <p>And time was, when ſome of them found it ſadly true; the Arguments that they had uſed againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> others galled their own ſides with; and they were forced to think thoſe anſwers good for them, which they will not allow to be ſo for us againſt them. And what dealing that is, I leave others to judge!</p>
                        <p>3. No nor thirdly do I think it worth the while, to ſtay to anſwer that trifling Objection, That this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of men alters the nature of the things; and ſure the Church of <hi>England</hi> thinks them more than Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or elſe it would not lay ſo much weight upon them, nor make ſo very great a ſtir about them.</p>
                        <p>It is a great miſtake, to think that the commanding of things indifferent makes any alteration in the nature of them; it alters them indeed with reſpect to us and our practice, but the things remain the ſame; and the Church commands them as things fitting to be done, but Indifferent ſtill in their nature; and ſo the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares them to be, after her commanding them: And her publick Declarations and Rubricks ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquit her from all ſuch thought; and if men will not believe her own Proteſtations, but ſtill pretend that ſhe believes contrary to what ſhe ſolemnly profeſſeth, it is but another inſtance of ſome mens ingenuity and candour towards her, and needs not be counted ſtrange in this Age.</p>
                        <p>Nor is her ſtanding ſo ſtiff (as men ſpeak) for theſe things, any argument of her thinking otherwiſe of them: for however a Ceremony be in it ſelf a ſmall thing, yet Faction and Diſobedience is a great one, and ought with all care to be ſuppreſſed; and that Church needs not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:350"/> be blamed for its ſharpneſs againſt Diſſentions about theſe, which hath already by ſad experience found, that gratifying Faction in theſe, hath in the iſſue been the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter overthrow of her whole Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>If any Church may be excuſed in this, certainly this may, which hath already felt the ſmart of Indulging in them; and cannot but be concerned, when it ſees the ſame practices purſued again; and that too, by thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men who trampled upon her with ſo much cruelty and ſcorn in the late time of her viſitation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The beginning of ſtrife</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is as when one letteth out a River:</hi> and ſo we have found Faction in theſe things to be alſo; and therefore no wonder if the wiſdom of the Church apply it ſelf with ſo much care, and quickneſs to obſtruct the ſmalleſt beginnings in that, as men do to repair the leaſt breach in thoſe Banks, which keep in the waters of the other.</p>
                        <p>4. Nor fourthly do I think I have any pertinent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion here to aſſert the obligation of humane Laws, or to diſpute whether they oblige the Conſciences of men in things that God hath left undetermined: We need but conſult Scripture for this, which will be plain, ſo long as the 13 Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall remain in the Canon, and not be expunged utterly by thoſe men, that truly would not be much more injurious to it in this inſtance, than they are in ſome others.</p>
                        <p>But were there no Scripture for it, I ſuppoſe we ſhould not need to diſpute it with any men, that ever are in Authority. There are few of theſe that will permit their own Authority to be diſputed, or Conſcience plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it, by their Children or Servants, or thoſe that they have the conduct of.</p>
                        <p>And we are beholding to our Brethren for letting us know their minds in this: For no men have been more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:351"/> rigorous in exacting obedience to all their Ordinances, and reproaching and puniſhing all that diſſented from them, as Enemies to God and Chriſt, than they know who in times paſt were.</p>
                        <p>Never were Inſtitutions of men magnified more for promoting the honour of God, exalting the Kingdom and Scepter of Chriſt, nor men charged more ſtrictly in point of Conſcience with obedience to them. So that the crying out againſt <hi>becoming the ſervants of men,</hi> is but an artifice to pull down Government, which when men have once leaped into, they will by no means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be uſed againſt themſelves.</p>
                        <p>5. But that which I am more directly concerned here to ſhew is, that the things related to in this Text were not onely indifferent, but undetermined too: I mean, no Law had been made by the Church about them one way or other. The truth of which it concerns me to make out, not onely to ſerve my preſent purpoſe, but becauſe it may be ſomething queſtioned, from what we read <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 29. where among the Canons of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Council, this is the firſt; <hi>That ye abſtain from meats offered to Idols:</hi> which ſeems to be the very thing that the Apoſtle is diſcourſing of in this place.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, it cannot be denied, that in the beginning of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe upon theſe things, from <hi>v.</hi> 14. to <hi>v.</hi> 25. the ſame things are related unto, that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by that Canon of the Council; <hi>i. e.</hi> the eating in the Idolatrous Feaſts of the Heathen, and of thoſe meats which they knew were by that Rite offered in Sacrifice unto their Idols. For the Heathen Sacrifices were not finiſhed onely at their Altar, but the Solemnity was continued and compleated by their eating and drinking together upon the remainders of what they had actually offered and conſumed in Sacrifice: Juſt as ſome of the Jewiſh Sacrifices (we know) were, from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:351"/> whom the Heathen tranſcribed many of their practices, aping them in almoſt all their Inſtitutions.</p>
                        <p>2. But then ſecondly, that which he takes occaſion to diſcourſe of afterwards, and to which this Speech immediately relates, ſeems to be very different from what he had been ſpeaking of before, and which is the thing prohibited by the Council of the Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>Which will appear ſufficiently, from theſe two Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtle here takes upon him a liberty to indulge a Latitude in theſe things; which be ſure he would never have done, had it been in that very Caſe, that the Apoſtles had determined before.</p>
                        <p>And this we may be the more certain of, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circumſtances of that whole affair, which (ſo much as concerns our preſent buſineſs) was briefly thus: The Jewiſh Converts retained a great veneration for the Ceremonial Law, to which they had been inured, and educated in the obſervation of: theſe being interſperſed abroad in many places, where many of the Heathens were converted to Chriſtianity, were greatly offended with that liberty, which they ſaw the others took in the uſe of thoſe meats which their Law prohibited as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
                        <p>This cauſed hot Conteſts, and ſharp Diſputes between the two Parties, to the breach of Chriſtian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the great Scandal of their Religion. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles therefore are conſulted in this great affair; and having maturely conſidered, and canvaſſed the matter, determine onely to reſtrain the liberty that the Gentile-Converts took, in theſe three inſtances: <hi>To abſtain from things offered to Idols, and from things Strangled, and from Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo he was the great Agent for them in this buſineſs, and the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:352"/> chief perſon that carried theſe Conſtitutions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles unto their Churches; of which at this time the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was one principal, and moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                        <p>Now it is not to be ſuppoſed that the Apoſtle would carry this Conſtitution and Order to them, which they ſo joyfully and thankfully embraced (ſaith St. <hi>Luke)</hi> and afterwards preſently would take upon him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with the ſtrict obſervation of, and to grant a great Indulgence and Latitude in.</p>
                        <p>This would be the ready way to expoſe himſelf and his Doctrine too, to contempt and cenſure, and to give cauſe for a ſharper reproof of himſelf, than he gave to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for a leſſer matter than this was.</p>
                        <p>So that we may be ſure, the particular matter here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto, was not the Caſe which the Canon of the Apoſtles had regulated, but that it was ſome other thing which had not been determined by them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And this we may collect alſo from the Phraſe in which he diſcourſeth this matter here in this Text: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſold in the ſhambles, that eat, asking no queſtion for Conſcience ſake,</hi> v. 25. and, <hi>If any of them that believe not, bid you to a feaſt,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>invite you to an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi> [for there is no <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the <hi>Greek] and ye be diſpoſed to go, whatſoever is ſet before you, eat, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake,</hi> v. 27.</p>
                        <p>By both which expreſſions it is plain, that the Apoſtle here is diſcourſing of another matter than what was enjoyned by the Canon, or at leaſt of the ſame thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very different denomination and circumſtance from that it is conſidered in there. For <hi>meat bought in the Shambles,</hi> and eating in the common entertainments of their Heathen Neighbours, are plainly different from the notion of <hi>things offered to Idols,</hi> taken notice of by the Canon.</p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:352"/>
                        <p>And this whole matter will be made plain, by giving an account of it, and ſhewing wherein the <hi>things offered to Idols</hi> intended by the Apoſtles, and thoſe diſcourſed of by the Apoſtle in this place do differ.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>things offered to Idols,</hi> forbidden by that Council were ſuch, part whereof was not onely offered in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but was ſolemnly eaten afterwards as the Idols meat; and the whole Feaſt continued as a ſolemn act of Religion and Sacrifice, (as we know it was) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed not onely as a Rite of confederating with the Idol, but of being more cloſely united unto him, and receiving a divine <hi>afflatus,</hi> and influence from him.</p>
                        <p>And although the Idol to which this was done, was really nothing, and the whole performance a meer vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, having no real foundation at all in nature, and ſo poſſibly theſe meats might have been ſafely partaken of, by thoſe that were well inſtructed, and knew theſe things: Yet the Apoſtles thought fit to forbid them, for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned reaſon of giving offence to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> enlargeth their reaſon in this Chapter; becauſe it was a <hi>confederating with Devils,</hi> and being <hi>partakers at the table of Devils,</hi> which he condemns as hugely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming them that eat at the Lords Table, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Grotius</hi> is ſo exact in this matter, as to tell us there were two ways by which men might eat of things ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idols, in the ſence that the Apoſtles mean.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Vel aliquid a Tabulâ,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>i. e.</hi> when at their publick Feaſts they ſent ſome part off the Table to be offered ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to the Idol, and to entitle him to the whole Feaſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Vel ab Aris ad Menſam defertis;</hi> or when they took ſome conſiderable portion from the Altar, and fed upon it at the Table, as part of the Idols portion, as was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.</p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:353"/>
                        <p>Now for the Chriſtians to be preſent at, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of theſe things, was that which the Apoſtles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid in that Canon; and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo is ſo ſharp upon, from 14 to 24 of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>But that which he ſpeaks of afterwards, is vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from it, and plainly means, either that part of the Offering which they afterwards ſpent in their ordinary meals, or which was publickly ſold afterwards in the Shambles.</p>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe is eaſily underſtood, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among them, to offer ſome part of the Sacrifice to their Idols, and to reſerve the reſt for their own common uſe; not looking upon it as ſacred, and the Idols por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in ſome great and ſolemn Sacrifices they did; but that which was truly their own, and at their own diſpoſal, eſpecially having given a part of it to their Gods.</p>
                        <p>The other, <hi>i. e.</hi> what was ſold in the Shamble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="1">1. It was either that which the Butcher ſold, part of which he himſelf had offered to the Idol, before he brought the reſt to the Shambles. <hi>Vel à Màcellario, qui ante quam ad marcellum carnes ferret, aliquid de Aram in dediſſet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Or that part which belonged to the Prieſts, and which they often ſold; having (it's probable) either more than they could ſpend themſelves; or perhaps ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mind to exchange it for other meat, which they might purchaſe with the money they ſold it for. <hi>Vel à Sacerdotibus, qui partes quae ipſis cederent, venderent,</hi> ſaith the ſame Author.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe were the meats about which the Apoſtles had made no order at all. So that men were at their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to buy and eat them if they pleaſed, without asking any queſtions, or troubling themſelves with any ſcruples of Conſcience about them.</p>

                        <p>And which the Apoſtle commands them to abſtain then onely from, when knowing what they were, their eating them might wound the Conſcience of another, and they might <hi>give offence</hi> thereby <hi>either to the Jews. or to the Gentiles, or to the Church of God.</hi> To the <hi>Jews,</hi> by ſeeing them make ſo little a matter of Idolatry: to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by encouraging and confirming them in that Idolatry, which they ought by all means to ſeek to wean them from: and <hi>to the Church of God,</hi> by ſeeing them ſo careleſs and regardleſs of the good and benefit of others, and without all charity to them.</p>
                        <p>By all which I hope it is ſufficiently clear, that theſe things to which this Speech relates, were not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their nature, but undetermined alſo as to their uſe, no Law having paſſed one way or other upon them.</p>
                        <p>Now this makes them vaſtly different from the things ſcrupled among us, and by conformity to which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is pretended to be given: For the uſe of theſe is already determined, and ſeveral Laws both of the Church and State, both of the Spiritual and Temporal power, have paſſed upon them.</p>
                        <p>So that how indifferent ſoever they may be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet it is not indifferent to us whether we obſerve them or not; but it is now matter of Obedience, and plain Duty; and theſe things are tied upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as ſtrongly as any matter of humane command is or can be.</p>
                        <p>And therefore in theſe we cannot ſhew favour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to others if we would; for we our ſelves are under Authority, and bound up by the Laws of thoſe above us. We have not the power of doing or forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor can we now abſtain for fear of offending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's Conſcience, without grievouſly wounding and worſe offending of our own; and whatever may be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:354"/> the conſequence of our Conformity, as to another man, yet we certainly Know, the neglect of it will be a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſin, and a grievous guilt unto our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>So that in this matter the fear of giving offence to others is impertinent, a Snare, and a direct Temptation; and as improperly urged againſt Conformity, as it would be againſt any other Duty how neceſſary ſoever, to tell us that there are a great many men that will be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with our doing of it. In this and all ſuch caſes, we ſtand immediately reſponſible unto God, and may juſtly retort that ſo much abuſed and miſtaken Apology of the Apoſtles, <hi>Whether it be not right to obey God, rather than regard men, judge ye.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. But there is a ſecond thing yet incumbent upon me, and that is to ſhew, that ſuppoſing the Text were pertinently urged againſt Conformity, and there were a real poſſibility of giving offence by it, yet it would not ſerve that purpoſe that it is produced for by our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren, but on the contrary make very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                        <p>And this I ſhall endeavour to make good, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering who the perſons are that the Apoſtle here cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions us againſt <hi>giving offence</hi> unto; not onely the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor onely the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor <hi>both</hi> theſe onely, but <hi>the Church of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From whence, before I come to the main Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this place againſt the purpoſe and practice of our Diſſenting Brethren, we may take occaſion to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the object of Scandal is, and who they are that men ought eſpecially to regard in their cares not to give it.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the Apoſtles writing this, there were three different ſorts of men that might be offended with eating things offered to Idols: the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and the body of Chriſtians, which he here calls <hi>the Church of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:354"/>
                        <p>In analogy to which, there are, and always will be, different Parties among which men converſe: Upon which account it will concern us to enquire, what our reſpects to them in this matter ought to be, and whether we ought to make any difference among them. And this we may reſolve our ſelves in, by conſidering the Caſes that concern us; which I think are onely theſe two.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When we perceive, or have reaſon to think, that what we are going to do will offend all Parties equally, then no doubt but we ought to forbear it. This was plainly the caſe here.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> might be prejudiced againſt Chriſtianity by this practice, ſeeing its Profeſſors make ſo little a matter of Idolatry, which their Law ſo ſtrictly prohibited, and God had always declared himſelf ſo ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be encouraged and confirmed in their Idolatry, by feeing men of the moſt holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as they called themſelves) conſent with them in it.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Church</hi> might be offended too, by ſeeing her Members have ſo little a regard to her Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the plain Canons of her great Founders.</p>
                        <p>And therefore they ought to be extreamly careful and cautious what they did in this nice point; and ſo ought we always to be in ſuch caſes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, it may ſo happen, that what we do may onely offend ſome. Theſe different Parties may have different apprehenſions of the ſame thing. Some may think it lawful, or a Duty; others may ſcruple it, or condemn it as a ſin. Now in this caſe it will concern us to conſider how we ought to govern our ſelves, and our actions, and what difference to make in our reſpects to men.</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:355"/>
                        <p>And the Apoſtles Rule in this Text, will be a ſafe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and direction to us, eſpecially it <hi>Ecumenius</hi> his Note be true, as it commonly is in all places where a Climax or Gradation is uſed, as it ſeems plainly to be in this place: His words are theſe; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c. conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, how he puts the chief thing laſt, and makes <hi>giving offence to the Church of God</hi> that which eſpecially we ought to have a care of: and he gives this reaſon for the equity of this Rule, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. it concerns us to endeavour to win others unto the Faith, but by no means to offend and grieve thoſe that already profeſs it. And certainly nothing can be more juſt and reaſonable than this is.</p>
                        <p>So that the ſum of this advice is plainly this; You ought, as near as you can, to do nothing to offend any; but however, take care not to offend the Church: You ough to have a charitable reſpect to all particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of what denomination ſoever, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but eſpecially to the <hi>Church,</hi> and never to give offence to that by any thing that you do.</p>
                        <p>Now this will be a clear guide to us in our preſent caſe: and not onely acquit Conformity, from all guilt of Scandal, but caſt it wholly upon Separation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to comply with the preſent Conſtitutions of the Church, ſince that is a direct giving offence to thoſe which the Apoſtle chiefly reſpects in this prohibition, <hi>i. e. the Church of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſtay not now to give the notion of the Church: I doubt not but all contending Parties underſtand that competently well.</p>
                        <p>Nor to prove the preſent national Church of <hi>England</hi> to be juſtly called <hi>the Church of God:</hi> this (God be thanked) is fully done, againſt both the oppoſite Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt her; thoſe that call her Heretical or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:355"/> on one hand; and thoſe that reproach her as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Antichriſtian, on the other.</p>
                        <p>Were her preſent Conſtitutions to be tried by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and Primitive practice; her Faith to be judged by that of the firſt Centuries, and four moſt truly General-Councils; or her Liturgy and Diſcipline, her Rites, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and way of publick Worſhip, to be compared with what we can collect and judge of thoſe pureſt times: Or were ſhe to ſtand or fall by the judgement and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the moſt able and learned of Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines abroad ſince the Reformation; ſhe would not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be juſtified, but commended; not onely paſs for a true and ſound part of Chriſts Church, but the moſt ſound and Orthodox, the moſt truly Primitive and Apoſtolical of any at this day on the face of the earth.</p>
                        <p>But I wave all this, and proceed to apply this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Rule of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to our own Caſe, as it is at this day, with reſpect to Scandal, and the danger of it, by conforming to the Church; which is plainly this.</p>
                        <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> having reformed it ſelf from thoſe Corruptions that had ſullied the truth and beauty of Chriſtian Doctrine and Worſhip; not by Noiſe and Tumult, and popular Faction, which too much influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſome forein Reformations, but upon grave and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber advice, with the concurrence of the lawful Civil Power; digeſted her Doctrinals into ſuch a number of Articles, as ſhe judged moſt conſonant to the Faith and Doctrine of the Apoſtles and firſt Councils: eſtabliſhed ſuch a Form of Worſhip, as upon moſt diligent enquiry and ſearch, ſhe found moſt agreeable to the practice of pure and Primitive Ages; and retained onely ſuch Rites and Uſages as ſhe found moſt ancient, and freeſt from any juſt and reaſonable Exceptions and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:356"/>
                        <p>All theſe thus conſtituted and framed, ſhe impoſeth as Conditions of her Communion, and requires Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto of all her Members. She will be grievouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if any of her Children reject, and comply not with this Conſtitution, as knowing her Knowledge and Integirty queſtioned, her Authority deſpiſed, and that Power that hath confirmed all this, contemned by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there are ſome particular men, ſome Hereticks, ſome Schiſmaticks, ſome either deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or leſs inſtructed perſons, that declare themſelves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by conforming to this Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>The queſtion now is, how we ſhall govern our ſelves, and which of theſe Conſiderations we will permit to ſway us: Whether reſpect to the Church and juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and fear of giving offence thereto, ſhall engage us to conform; or whether reſpect to ſome private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and fear of offending and angring them, ſhall cauſe us to caſt off all regard to thoſe Laws and Conſtitutions, and all care to comply with them.</p>
                        <p>This is the plain Caſe; and were there no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to determine us, (when yet there are many) I would deſire nothing plainer than the direction of the Apoſtle in this Text; where he tells us, that the perſons we ought chiefly to have a care not to give offence unto, are <hi>the Church of God.</hi> If ſome private perſons and the Church come in competition, and we muſt needs offend ſome, we ought to have a greater reſpect to the Church, than unto them. And were it truly giving them offence, (which yet it is not) yet were it ſo, I ſay, we ought not to attend ſo to that Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to caſt off all regard and care to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>This (I think) is a Rule ſo very reaſonable at the very hearing of, and ſo fair upon its own reaſons, that I do
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:356"/> not know whether it be really worth while to go to adde any ſtrength to it: We might venture it to its own ſtrength to ſtand or fall, and may challenge any one to aſſault or undertake it.</p>
                        <p>Yet however, I ſhall proceed to enlarge a little more upon it, and to adde ſome Conſiderations which may make it ſomething more popularly plain and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. And firſt, I deſire to have it fairly conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought not to have at leaſt as fair a reſpect to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> as to any private perſons, of what cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or denomination ſoever.</p>
                        <p>I do not ſee upon what reaſons any perſon can deny this to me, eſpecially in a caſe where we cannot charge the Church with any plain degeneracy, or open Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Doctrine or Practice of the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>When any particular Church degenerates plainly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Doctrine or Worſhip, there I am not concerned to determine how far ſhe forfeits all that reſpect that ſhe might otherwiſe claim from men, nor how much the Credit of a ſingle perſon may vie with her. Perhaps when the Church was degenerated into <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> the judgement of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and ſome few other Biſhops, was more to be regarded than that of a whole Synod; and in the horrid Apoſtacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ſingle Doctrine of <hi>John Huſs</hi> was preferable to that of the whole Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> But ſtill in both theſe Caſes (or any other parallel ones) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect derived it ſelf not from their perſons, but was wholly owing to truth, and the holy Scriptures that ſtood with them.</p>
                        <p>But bleſſed be God, this is not our caſe; our Church doth challenge and triumph over all charges of any ſuch Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; and all the diſputes and conteſts with her by any of theſe men, are about things confeſſedly doubtful, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:357"/> ſuch as are in their own nature indifferent: things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which (to ſay the leaſt) it is as poſſible that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons may erre and miſtake, as it is for the Church; unleſs in this alſo (as in many other inſtances) men fall in with the groſſeſt Tenet in Popery, that ſingle perſons may more reaſonably pretend to Infallibility than the whole Church.</p>
                        <p>Every man derides, and thinks he can baffle all the pretences of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to Infallibility, and therefore ſhould bluſh and be aſhamed of his own ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arrogating it to himſelf, or aſcribing it to another. For, the truth is, I do not ſee but his pretences are as juſt as another man's, <hi>i. e.</hi> indeed they are both monſtrouſly unreaſonable.</p>
                        <p>And yet alas this is not the leaſt ſource of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of this Age; nor need I be condemned for ſtaying a little while to drop a tear upon it. Men turn Dictators in Religion, and impoſe their own Dreams as magiſterially upon their Followers, as if they were ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and I am perſwaded, their Diſciples hang as much upon their ſingle authority and confidence, and yield as abſolute and implicite Faith to all their Doctrines, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any poor Papiſts, againſt whom they exclaim ſo tragically for blind Obedience and Faith: They are kept in as abſolute ſubjection to their <hi>placits,</hi> and dare no more read and conſult Books that are written to inform them, than a poor Papiſt dare let a prohibited Book be ſeen in his Houſe, by a Father of the Inquiſition.</p>
                        <p>If ever people followed their leaders blindfold, theſe men do: they will not hear any thing againſt them; They <hi>have their perſons in admiration;</hi> and I wiſh I could not ſay of ſome, <hi>for filthy lucres ſake,</hi> or at leaſt ſome mean reaſons equivalent thereto. They will not ſo much as ſubmit to means of Information; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay they are ſatisfied already; and the ſingle blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:357"/> of one of their own Rabbies, ſhall ſignifie more with them, than all the Arguments of the moſt Learned and ſober men living beſide.</p>
                        <p>But I am inſenſibly drawn aſide from my chief Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is not to treat ſo much of a reſpect of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Faith, as of Tenderneſs and Charity; which is certainly as juſtly due from us to the Church, as to any private perſons whatſoever; and it cannot but be as unreaſonable to fail in the one, as in the other. It is every whit as unjuſt for men to be more regardleſs of grieving and troubling the Church of Chriſt, as it is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and unreaſonable to ſet up one ſingle man's opinion againſt that of many others, that are in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and advantages of Knowledge, and every way both as knowing and as upright as himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Whatever conſiderations there are to determine our Charity to ſingle perſons, there are the ſame (at leaſt) to make it neceſſary towards the Church, and as ſtrong reaſons to reſtrain us from offending the one, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Whatever becomes an Argument in one caſe, is equally ſo alſo in the other; and if it be not as effectual with us, we are partial in the Law, and diſtinguiſh without any reaſons, but thoſe of our own partial and unjuſt reſpects.</p>
                        <p>Let men be pleaſed to look into the Scriptures, and conſult the practices of our Lord himſelf, or his Apoſtles after him, and their thoughts will ſoon be reſolved in this matter; they will find the one calling for as much defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect to the Church, as to private perſons, and the other upon all occaſions as careful to pay it; and in all caſes extreamly careful not to give offence to it in any thing whatſoever; as were eaſie to ſhew in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances enough that are plain and obvious to all that read, and can ſcarce paſs unobſerved by any.</p>
                        <p>This is the firſt Conſideration; and I appeal to all, if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:358"/> it be not a very eaſie <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> a very modeſt and reaſonable intimation: and yet (I aſſure you) it were a good point gained, and a very good ſtep towards our peace, were men hearty in their conceſſions of it. Would men pay but the ſame deference to the Church of Chriſt, and her Conſtitutions, as they readily do to their own ſingle Opinions, or the confident ſuggeſtions of ſome admired Leader, we might quickly hope to ſee ſome end of our Queſtions and Diſputes: And would they be but as tender of giving any offence to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as they are of doing ſo to every little perſon of their own party, we might begin to hope, that the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Church might gain ſome reſpect, and ſome meaſure of peaceableneſs and modeſty bleſs the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Nation once more.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But this is too little to ſuggeſt, and the leſſer part of what I would propoſe to conſideration upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and therefore in the ſecond place, I deſire it may be conſidered, whether we ought not to have a greater reſpect to the Church of God, than to any ſingle or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>And truly I think this is as reaſonable a <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> as the other, and that which will be as ſoon granted true by all that duly conſider things. In all things whatſoever, the Publick requires more reſpect from us than any private perſon; and the welfare of the one, is to be preferred by us before that of the other.</p>
                        <p>If the Church of Chriſt and any private Party of men come in competition, and it ſo happen, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may give offence to one, we ought to let our regard to the Church ſway and determine us, and think it a leſs evil that ſome particular perſons be offended, than that trouble or offence be given to the whole Church.</p>
                        <p>That ſaying of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> recorded <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 50. though ſpoken with an unjuſt and barbarous deſign, yet is a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:358"/> certain and rational truth: <hi>It is expedient that one man ſuffer, and not the whole Nation periſh:</hi> And it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a leſs evil to grieve or offend ſome private perſons, than to trouble and diſturb, and endanger the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Church; which we muſt needs do, if at every private perſons pleaſure, we take upon us a liberty to diſpenſe with the Commands and Inſtitutions of it.</p>
                        <p>And this is a Rule that not only all wiſe Nations, but even all men ſtill act by, in Caſes that are any way like to this.</p>
                        <p>All Nations prefer the Publick good before the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: and think it much better, that ſome ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuffer inconvenience, than that the Publick be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered; and have ever ſet the worſt Characters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe men, that have ſacrificed the good of their Country to their own private Ambition and Revenge; and never regarded what Confuſion and Miſchief thus bring upon it, ſo they may pleaſe and gratifie their own Paſſions. All the world hath ever hated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached theſe as Monſters of men, and I hope we in time ſhall learn to do ſo alſo.</p>
                        <p>Nay, we ſee nothing more common among the wiſeſt Nations, than to puniſh ſingle perſons for the correction and good of the whole; and many times to cut off thoſe, whoſe crimes in their own nature were not ſo great, and who ſeemed fairly capable of mercy, onely to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Warnings to others, and to deter them from any thing by which the Publick might be endangered, and which were but the leaſt ſteps to the diſſolution of its Government,</p>
                        <p>And we ſhall ſee all men act by this Rule too, in their own concerns, even any of our diſſenting Brethren themſelves. They do not ſuffer every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to neglect, and ſpeak againſt their eſtabliſhments,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:359"/> but chuſe rather to puniſh and moleſt them, than endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their whole Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>And they prefer their own Body, and the health of it, before any particular Member: they readily gaſh and cut one, to ſave all; yea, and will have a putrid and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Member taken off, rather than it ſhall endanger the good of the whole Body. So true is it, that the more Publick good ought to be preferred to the more private, and that all men naturally yield a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the whole Society, than they do to any ſingle Member of it.</p>
                        <p>And that the ſame Rule ought to be obſerved by us in our preſent Caſe of giving Offence, I ſhall endeavour to make evident, both by plain Warrant of Scripture, and by ſome proper Conſiderations, which all men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the reaſonableneſs of in other caſes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I begin firſt with ſearching what warrant for this we can find in holy Scripture, either in the Precepts and Directions of it, or in the Lives and Actions of thoſe who are propoſed there to our imitation.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, as for Precept and Direction, I think that of St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. 10. to be very plain, and a firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for what I am upon: <hi>As we have therefore oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, let us do good to all, eſpecially to thoſe of the houſhold of faith.</hi> Where it is plain, the Apoſtle not only allows, but enjoyns us to make a difference in our Charity, and to ſhew this upon all occaſions, rather to <hi>the houſhold of Faith, (i. e.</hi> to <hi>the Church of God)</hi> than to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>This place is full, and directly comes up to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, and the pretences made about it: For Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is as direct and plain a duty, as the not giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; it is as ſtrictly enjoyned as the other; and the neglect of Charity is as ſeverely threatned, as the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Offence is, or can be: And yet for all this, when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:359"/> the Church of Chriſt, and any other perſons whatever, come in competition, and are Candidates for our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we ought to ſhew it unto that, and not unto theſe. And the ſame reaſons that determine thus our Charity, will determine as well our care of not giving Offence; eſpecially ſince this is a proper and principal act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and no one (that I know of) more ſo.</p>
                        <p>This will be a ſufficient anſwer to all the tragical ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ſin of Scandal, and the great neceſſity of not giving it to any.</p>
                        <p>We are expreſly charged <hi>not to give Offence,</hi> and ſo we are expreſly charged <hi>above all things</hi> to <hi>put on Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In giving Offence, we muſt have a regard to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt perſon in the Church, and a woe is denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that <hi>offends a little one.</hi> And ſo we are in charity commanded too, and a woe threatned to him that <hi>ſhuts up his bowels of Compaſſion</hi> from the meaneſt ſervant of God. Yea, this is commanded even to the creatures below us.</p>
                        <p>And yet for all this, we muſt prefer the Church before all others; and if it ſhould ſo happen, that Charity could not be ſhewed unto both, we ought to determine our reſpects and Charity to the Church, and to ſuſpend the acts of it unto the others; and muſt do ſo too in our Charity of not offending or grieving the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome diſproportion could be ſhewed in this from the other acts of Charity, or ſome reaſons here to alter the caſe; which, I am very ſure, cannot. This place alone, if there were none others, ſufficiently determines this Caſe.</p>
                        <p>And that we are warranted alſo by the Precedents of the New Teſtament to act by this Rule, the actions of thoſe great men whoſe lives are there recorded for our imitation, do ſhew us.</p>
                        <p>The Life of our bleſſed Saviour is a good example for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:360"/> us in this, as well as in all other inſtances of duty that are incumbent on us: We find him in every thing pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mighty deference to the Church of the Jews, and ſtudiouſly avoiding to give any diſpleaſure or offence unto them; and this in many things which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had introduced, without any expreſs Warrant or Command from God; as were eaſie to ſhew, and hath been by many learned men of late.</p>
                        <p>But there is one inſtance which comes pretty well up to our preſent caſe; and that is his paying Tribute, of which you have the ſtory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27. there is no doubt but by this he might give ſome offence (in this looſe notion of offence) <hi>i. e.</hi> occaſion ſome trouble in his followers, by owning himſelf a ſtranger, and paying Tribute as ſuch; nevertheleſs he choſe to do that, rather than to give any offence to the Publick: <hi>Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that we offend them not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Whether the perſons he was ſo careful here not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend were the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, or the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is all one to our preſent Caſe. If it were the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> then we ſee he was more careful not to offend them than his own Followers. But if it were the Government of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it concludes more ſtrongly for us and for our preſent Caſe, where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is Chriſtian, and that of the Church and of the Kingdom one and the ſame; where we cannot offend the Church, but we muſt offend the Government and Civil Power too, under whoſe protection and favour it is eſtabliſhed, and whoſe Canons it hath adopted into its own Laws.</p>
                        <p>After this great example, I proceed to take notice of ſome that we find regiſtred in the life of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the like purpoſe. I inſtance onely in two, which will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
                        <p>The firſt was his <hi>circumciſing Timothy,</hi> of which you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:360"/> have the ſtory, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3. It is certain, <hi>Timothy</hi> might have objected againſt Circumciſion, and pleaded his freedom from any obligation to it, being the Son of a <hi>Grecian</hi> Father; and there is no reaſon to doubt but it muſt be irkſome and troubleſome to him: yet for all that, St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath greater reſpect to the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe parts, which might be offended, had he not been circumciſed, his Mother being a Jew.</p>
                        <p>The other is that famous ſtory of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>ſhaving his head and purifying himſelf in the Temple</hi> with the men that had a vow upon them, juſt according to the manner preſcribed in the Levitical Law: you have the account of it <hi>Acts</hi> 21. from 23, to 27.</p>
                        <p>I do not at all queſtion, but this action of St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be ſtrangely looked upon at firſt by <hi>Trophimus,</hi> and thoſe other Heathen Converts that came with him to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who knowing his Doctrine, and manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation abroad, could ſcarce chuſe but reflect with ſome trouble upon this action; and the truth is, it was a plain temptation to them to have ſome hard thoughts of him. Yet notwithſtanding this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> preferred his reſpect to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and choſe rather to incur this cenſure of theirs, than to give any offence to the Church of Chriſt which was there.</p>
                        <p>From which example a great advantage may be drawn, not onely to direct us what regard to have to the Church of God in general, above any private perſons; but even to a National or Local Church, which is but a member and part of Chriſts Church, and from which, the conſtitution of other Churches as to Cuſtoms and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages may be different.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have pleaded ſtrongly againſt this thing, to which St. <hi>James</hi> adviſed him, eſpecially upon the account of offence to thoſe that were with him, and to others from whom he came; yet for all this, his reſpect
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:361"/> to the preſent Church where he was, and his care not to offend it, overcame all other conſiderations, and cauſed him readily to do that, which neither they were greatly pleaſed with, nor himſelf in all probability neither.</p>
                        <p>Which hath often brought to my mind, the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical temper of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in that famous anſwer of his to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Mother, which he magnifies ſo highly for Oracular and Divine; <hi>That at</hi> Millain <hi>he did not obſerve the Sabbath-faſt, becauſe it was not the uſage of his Church; but at</hi> Rome <hi>he did, becauſe it was the cuſtom there:</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing her in all ſuch things, to make the cuſtom of the preſent Church her Precedent and Rule, and by no means to give any offence to it.</p>
                        <p>By both which notable Examples, we may learn by what meaſure to govern our ſelves in theſe things; namely, a reſpect to the Uſages and Conſtitutions of the preſent Church we are in, provided they be not ſinful, and plainly contrary to any Law of God: for of ſuch things I am ſpeaking all this while, and about ſuch things it is that our preſent diſpute about giving offence is by both ſides acknowledged to be.</p>
                        <p>I onely add one thing more, before I leave this Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That if we ought to have this great and over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling reſpect to any National Church of Chriſt, to which we chance to come, and in which we ſojourn, we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought much more to have the ſame to our own National Church, in which we not onely live, but were born and baptiſed Members of; and therefore ſuffer our regard to it to over-rule all other reſpects to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may interfere with it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things might be enough to aſſure the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the preſent Conſideration; and I do not ſee what can well be objected againſt them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And yet I ſhall proceed to ſome Popular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations here alſo, which are owned for ſound and good
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:361"/> Rules to act by in all other like Caſes, by all ſorts of men; and which, when applied in our Caſe, will preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it our concern and duty, to have greater care not to give offence to the Church of God, than to any private perſons.</p>
                        <p>Four of theſe I ſhall juſt mention, and leave to take effect by our leiſurely conſideration of them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That offending the Church, is offending the greater party: I hope, I may ſay, not onely greater than any other ſingle denomination of men, but than all of them together.</p>
                        <p>I know how forward each party hath been to boaſt its number, and ſome to threaten Authority with their ſtrength; and to that purpoſe, to make falſe muſters, and great ſhews; to crowd together upon all occaſions, and to make it piacular for one to be abſent, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Party or the Cauſe was to be credited.</p>
                        <p>But thanks be to God, that we have publick eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now, and of late, that the Church-party is not ſo ſmall and inconſiderable as ſome men would have it thought to be.</p>
                        <p>It is true, honeſt men are not apt to be noiſie and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous; the ſenſe of their own Integrity ſatisfieth them, and the aſſurance that they are known to God, is to them more than Ten thouſand witneſſes. They do not uſe to boaſt of themſelves, nor court greatly man's obſervance; they keep their ſtation, and uſe not to run from place to place; an art by which the ſame man may appear ten or twenty; and this perhaps hath made ſome good men fearful, and ſome others confident: But thanks be to God, they know one another better now, and have ſignalized their numbers to material purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>Now this ought to be a ſwaying conſideration with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:362"/> all ſcrupulous perſons in this caſe. In all others, it is thought ſafeſt to offend the leſſer party, ſuppoſing them but in the ſame circumſtances with others: And when a Diſſenter conſiders that by Conforming, he can but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſome few of his own ſmall party, or at moſt but ſome few of others, but by his Separation ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend the whole Church, methinks it ſhould ſoon teach him which ſide of the Queſtion to chuſe.</p>
                        <p>Unleſs thoſe few muſt be counted the onely wiſe, and the onely good, the ſober and the godly party; and the whole Church be diſparaged, as conſiſting onely of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and looſe, ſilly and diſſolute perſons.</p>
                        <p>When, bleſſed be God, plain experience contradicts both, and ſhews them to be equal at leaſt to their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious accuſers, both for knowledge and virtue; and there is nothing to make them appear otherwiſe, but onely the Pride and Uncharitableneſs of ſome men, whoſe intereſt it is to have them believed to be ſo. <hi>But Wiſdom is juſtified in her Children.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Offending the Church of Chriſt muſt needs be of worſe conſequence than offending any private party of men. I need not ſtay to remark each ſingle inſtance in which this is evident, every man's reaſon will ſuggeſt enough to him.</p>
                        <p>Neither God, nor Religion, can be ſo much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the one, as in the other; nor can the Souls of men, or the peace of the World, be ſo much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by private offences, as by thoſe againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church: Mens guilts are higher and more injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves, and the effects are more dangerous and miſchievous to others: which is another good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to ſway men in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>For a wiſe man will weigh the probable effects of what he doth; and where an honeſt and uninſtructed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:362"/> man is uncertain whether he may do or forbear ſuch things, and after his enquiry remains ſcrupulous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved, it is a good means to determine himſelf by, to conſider as well as he can what the effects and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of what he is going to do or forbear, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood will be; and that which he ſees attended with a train of the worſe, and more miſchievous conſequences, diſargues it ſelf, and pronounceth its own condemnation: And by theſe effects he may make as true a difference, as if the plain eſſence and nature of the things were naked unto his view.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Offending the Church of God, is offending thoſe to whom we owe more duty than we do unto any private party whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs, charity and reſpect, and all the poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtances of it, we owe to every private perſon with whom we converſe, and to whom we are any way related; and God hath made all this, matter of plain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>But it is a great deal more than this, that we owe thoſe that are <hi>over us in the Lord,</hi> and his whole Church; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as much more as we owe of deference and Duty, of Obedience and Submiſſion to a Father and a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and thoſe that God and Nature hath ſet above us, above that common Charity and Duty that we are to owe to one that is in all reſpects our equal.</p>
                        <p>The Laws of all Nations conſider us under greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to our Parents, and to our Country, than to any ſingle perſons whatſoever; and make injuring of a Father or our Prince, more heinous than doing the ſame to a common perſon upon the ſame level with us.</p>
                        <p>And I am ſure the Laws of God, and Religion too, conſidering us as Members of the Church, and calling
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:363"/> the Governours of it our <hi>Fathers in Christ,</hi> let us know what great duty we owe to them; and of how much greater guilt it muſt needs be, to offend them, than our Fellow-chriſtian, or any Party in which we can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. There is a complication of ſins and guilt in the one, when there is but the breach of common charity in the other.</p>
                        <p>I deny not but men may joyn themſelves to ſuch a Party, and make another man their Guide, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the Conduct of him, and thereby oblige themſelves to more duty than they owe to others. But this is duty of their own choice, and the failure in it a ſin of their own cauſing; and doth no more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede their original and primer obligations, which God and Nature had layd on them, than the being faithful to a company of <hi>Banditi</hi> will excuſe diſloyalty to our Prince and Country; or than giving a gift to the <hi>Corban</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> would atone undutifulneſs to a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Parent.</p>
                        <p>However men may divide themſelves from the Church, of which Providence and Religion have made them Members, and enter themſelves into ſeparate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet they muſt remember that they owe duty to it ſtill; that no voluntary and ſecond Compacts of their own, can diſſolve their primitive Obligations; or their care to continue faithful to the one, expiate their regardleſs offending of the other: for they do owe more duty to the one than to the other; what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to owe to one, is contracted by themſelves; but what they owe to the other, is bound on them by the ſacred and ſtrong ties of Religion and Providence.</p>
                        <p>And this is another good Argument to determine a ſcrupulous perſon in this matter: If he be in doubt which he had beſt to offend, the Church of Chriſt, or his own private Party, and know not by what conſiderations to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:363"/> determine his reſolution; let him in Gods name conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which he owes moſt, what the Laws of God make his duty to the one more than to the other; and then, if he be honeſt and ſingle-eyed, he will ſoon be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſolve his ſcruple, and know what choice he ought to make.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Offending the Church of God is truly a grievous Scandal, and an Offence, in the true Goſpel-notion of it; but the offending particular perſons may poſſibly not be ſo.</p>
                        <p>That which I mean is this; the Church of God we may be ſure will not take offence but upon juſt reaſon; but other men may call that an offence to them, which really is not. If we do that which grieves and injureth the whole Church, then we do properly offend, and are guilty of Scandal in the true notion of it. But if we onely offend ſome private perſons of our own party, they may call that an offence which is not ſo: For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very grieving (and offending of another in that ſenſe of the word) is not a formal Scandal, as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and hath been ſince this, made clear by a better Pen.</p>
                        <p>And to apply this to our preſent matter in debate, this is really ſo in our Caſe of Conformity: the refuſal of it, and ſeparating our ſelves from the Communion of the Church, is truly that giving of offence which the Goſpel condemns; it is laying a ſnare in the way of men, intrapping them into that damnable ſin of Schiſm; it is an obſtructing the effect of Religion, and a direct hinderance of that Concord and Love, that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and Peace, that it ſo ſtrictly calls for among Chriſtians, and deſignes to render the World happy by.</p>
                        <p>But you may challenge any diſſenting perſon to ſhew
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:364"/> how angring ſome private perſons, and a ſingle party of Schiſmaticks, can be a Scandal to them; or to name any one ſin that it is temptation to them to commit, and to inſtance that prejudice or diſſervice that it doth to Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                        <p>It is poſſible (I muſt confeſs) that grief and anger at ſuch a perſons Conformity, may irritate and provoke men to ſome things that are evil. But then I ſay that this is the fault of them that are angry, and not his, with whom they are cauſeleſly offended; it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an offence on their parts, but not giving it by him. For if we muſt call every thing an offence, that any man doth pervert into an occaſion of evil, there will ſcarce any, no not the beſt actions of men, eſcape that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                        <p>This methinks is a very material conſideration, and ought always to ſway with men in this Caſe; and if men could not determine themſelves in it by other Reaſons, yet they might by this: They ſhould conſider which is moſt likely to judge trueſt what is Scandal, and what is not; and when both ſides ſay they are offended, which is likely to be ſo indeed.</p>
                        <p>Particular perſons, and Parties of men may miſtake, and it is notorious, often do call that an Offence and Scandal, which is not ſo. But the whole Church is not ſo like to take cognizance of, and be offended publickly with any thing which doth not deſerve that name. To which we may caſt in this conſideration, to add weight to the other: Every offence to a ſingle private perſon or perſons, is not the ſin of Scandal; but no man can offend the Church of God, but he ſins grievouſly, and is directly guilty of a great Scandal.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, the ſum of all that I would have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on this Subject, is this.</p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:364"/>
                        <p n="1">1. That the fear of giving offence to weak and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed perſons by Conformity to our Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Communion of it, is cauſeleſs, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any juſt reaſon: Conformity being neither a ſin, nor cauſal of any, nor any juſt cauſe of offence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons whatſoever.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it is now matter of plain and indiſpenſible duty, tied on us by the Commands and Laws both of God and man, and therefore carefully to be done, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the conſequences of it to others: That no ſnares or poſſibilities of offence to ſome men by it ought to ſuperſede our care, or can atone the ſin of negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of it: That we cannot forbear it now, for fear of offending others, without grievouſly offending our ſelves, and our own Conſciences.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That our refuſing to Conform, will greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Church of God; and indeed it doth ſo: Not onely our own National Church of <hi>England,</hi> but even all the Reformed Churches abroad too, as may be ſeen in ſome Declarations of the Great men among them of late, who cannot but grieve to ſee their great Bulwark, and the whole Reformation, ſo battered and weakned by this means, and ſuch great advantage thereby given to the great Enemy againſt it.</p>
                        <p>And therefore that this conſideration ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate all the ſcruples and fears, and fancied poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of giving offence to private perſons of our own party by it.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, that the effect of all this, diſcover it ſelf in a ſpeedy conſcientious care, and honeſt endeavour to put a period to our cauſeleſs Separations and Diviſions, which are the onely true Scandal and giving Offence that I know of in this Caſe.</p>

                        <p>ONE of the main Points which our diſſenting Brethren inſiſt on to juſtifie their Separation from our Church, is, That our Publick Worſhip is perform'd in a Form of Words of Man's Invention; which, they conceive, is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for hereby, ſay ſome of them, the Holy Spirit, who inſpires our Prayer, is ſtinted and limited, and hereby the Gift of Prayer, ſay others, which the Holy Spirit communicates to Miniſters, to enable them to expreſs the Devotions of their Congregations to God, is rendred uſeleſs; and not only ſo, but even the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of the Congregation too are mightily deaden'd, by being continually expreſs'd in the ſame form of words: beſides, that the wants of Chriſtians being various, caſual, and emergent, cannot be ſo fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:372"/> in a fixt Form, as in conceiv'd Prayers, which upon the account of their variation in Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may be the better extended to the continual va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of Mens caſes and circumſtances: beſides all which, ſay they, we have no warrant for the uſe of Forms, either in Scripture, or pure Antiquity; and if we had, yet an univerſal impoſition of them, can by no means be lawfully compli'd with: this, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt recollection I can make, is the ſum of what our Brethren urge againſt the lawfulneſs of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us in a ſtated Liturgy, or Form of Publick Worſhip: and therefore, in order to the ſatisfying their Conſciences in this matter, I ſhall reduce their whole Plea to theſe following Caſes, and indeavour a plain and clear reſolution of them.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>In order to the reſolution of this Caſe, it will be neceſſary to explain firſt, what it is that the Scripture attributes to the Spirit in Prayer; and ſecondly, what is meant by ſtinting or limiting the Spirit in Prayer.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What is it that the Scripture attributes to the Spirit in Prayer? I anſwer, there are ſome things at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him which were extraordinary, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary; and others that are ordinary, fixt, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The through ſtate and diſtinguiſhing of which will very much contribute to the reſolution of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, and therefore I ſhall inſiſt more largely upon it.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, I ſay there are ſome things attributed to the Holy Spirit in this matter of Prayer which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and temporary; and that was the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Inſpiration of the matter of Prayer, together with an ability to expreſs and utter it in known or unknown Languages: thus as for the immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter of Prayer, we read in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Prayers and Praiſes, which, upon ſpecial occaſions, were immediately indited by Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: for ſo when <hi>Hannah</hi> preſented her Son to the Lord in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the Text only ſaith, that ſhe praid, and ſaid; but the <hi>Targum</hi> paraphraſes it, that ſhe praid by the Spirit of Propheſie, and accordingly praying and praiſing by immediate inſpiration, is frequently call'd propheſying: So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall come upon thee, and thou ſhalt propheſie;</hi> that is, as Expoſitors generally interpret it, thou ſhalt utter Spiritual Pſalms and Hymns by immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:373"/> on the place; and to the ſame purpoſe is the word uſed <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 1. and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in the New Teſtament it is ſaid of <hi>Zacharias, that he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and propheſied, ſaying, bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The matter of all which Prayers and Praiſes, together with thoſe in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and ſundry others recorded in Scripture, was immediately dictated to thoſe inſpir'd perſons by the Holy Ghoſt, and deliver'd by them without any recourſe to their own invention or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, though as to the words of them, it may be juſtly queſtion'd, whether they were not left to their own compoſure, as it ſeems very probable, the words of all other inſpirations were; for conſidering how the inſpired perſons differ'd in their ſtile, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they differ'd in their education, in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, and intellectual improvements, it is very likely they themſelves compoſed and worded their own inſpirations, the Spirit of God taking care only ſo to overſee and direct them, that their words might not miſrepreſent their matter; and if ſo, how much leſs reaſon have we to ſuppoſe, that the Spirit inſpires the words of our Prayers: but this I ſhall not inſiſt on.</p>
                           <p>However, after that great deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> wherein the gift of Tongues was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to enable the firſt Planters of the Goſpel, to propagate it through the World, it's certain that not only the Matter of their Prayers, but even the very Language too in which they expreſs them, was immediately inſpired, inſomuch that they were not only inabled to Pray upon the place in apt and fluent Expreſſions, but alſo to Pray in Languages, which they never underſtood before, and which even then they underſtood but very imperfectly, and alſo to interpret
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:373"/> thoſe Prayers into the vulgar Language, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others had utter'd in unknown Tongues; and this, among others, the Apoſtle calls a Spiritual Gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1. which, as I remember, is the only place where the Gift of Prayer is mention'd in Scripture: and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 14. it is alſo call'd a Spirit, where he gives us an account at large of this miraculous way of praying.</p>
                           <p>Now that this miraculous Gift of praying in, and interpreting Prayers out of unknown Tongues was extraordinary, and temporary, and peculiar to the Primitive Ages of Chriſtianity, is evident, becauſe the deſign of it was not only to enable the firſt Planters of the Goſpel to perform their Miniſterial Office in the vulgar Languages of the ſeveral Nations they were ſent to, but alſo to be a ſign from God, as all other Miracles were, for the confirmation of the Goſpel; for ſo the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>That Tongues were for a ſign, not to them that believe, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not:</hi> and therefore ſince it's granted of all hands, that the gift of Miracles was extraordinary, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only for a demonſtration of the Goſpel to the Infidel World, and after that to ceaſe, there can be no doubt but this miraculous Gift of Prayer was ſo too.</p>
                           <p>But that the Spirit's inditing the Matter, and, if you will, the words of thoſe inſpired Prayers, was alſo extraordinary, will require a larger proof; becauſe it is look'd upon by many of our diſſenting Brethren as an ordinary and ſtanding Gift, which the Spirit doth and will communicate to all ſucceſſive Ages of the World. Againſt this Opinion of theirs, therefore I ſhall briefly offer theſe following Reaſons to their conſideration:</p>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:374"/>
                           <p>1. That there is no promiſe of any ſuch Gift, and therefore no reaſon to expect the continuance of it. For whatſoever ſtanding and ordinary benefits we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God, we receive them by vertue of the New Covenant, in which he hath promiſed to us all thoſe good things which we can reaſonably expect at his hands; and the promiſe of God being the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our hope, it is preſumption to promiſe our ſelves what he hath not promiſed us: but now in all the New Covenant we have not the leaſt intimation of any ſuch promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirit will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately indite to us the Matter and Expreſſions of our Prayers; For as for that of <hi>Zachary</hi> 12. 10. which is the only promiſe that is pretended in the caſe, it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, at firſt ſight, that it's nothing to the purpoſe; <hi>I will pour out upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the Spirit of Grace and Supplications, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierc'd, and they ſhall mourn.</hi> What is all this to the immediate inſpiration of the Matter and Expreſſions of our Prayer, when it's plain, that the Spirit of Supplication here is the ſame with the Spirit of Grace, or of inward Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? even as the following words imply, <hi>and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and mourn:</hi> that is, for their horrid ſin of crucifying me. But that there is no ſuch promiſe in the New Covenant is evident, from what is acknowledged of all hands, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are many good Chriſtians who could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any ſuch inſpiration, who are ſome of them fain to be beholding to their own recollection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention for the Matter and Words of their Prayers, and others, for want of a ſufficient quickneſs of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be beholding to Forms of Prayer of other mens compoſure; neither of which they need, were they immediately inſpir'd: And I am very confident
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:374"/>
'twould be look'd upon by all ſober Diſſenters as a very raſh and unjuſt cenſure to affirm, that a man cannot be a good Chriſtian, who doth not pray by immediate inſpiration, but is always fain to depend either on his own invention, or a Form of Prayer for the Matter and Expreſſions of his Devotions: and if ſo, how can this conſiſt with a ſtanding promiſe of immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of Prayer in the New Covenant? unleſs we will ſuppoſe that there are Bleſſings promiſed in the New Covenant, to which good Chriſtians may have no right or title, and of which they may never actually partake, which is utterly to deſtroy the nature of the Covenant, which extends to all who perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, and to cut off all our dependance upon it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That as there is no promiſe, ſo there is no need of any ſuch immediate inſpiration. 'Tis true, Chriſt hath promiſed by his Spirit, to be with us to the end of the World, and aſſur'd us, that he will give his Spirit unto every one that asks, and to what end hath he promiſed this, but only to ſupply our Neceſſities, and inable us to perform thoſe Duties, which, through our own impotency, we cannot perform without him? for ſo he argues from the readineſs of Parents, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Children with what is neceſſary to their bodily life and ſubſiſtence, to the readineſs of God to beſtow his Spirit (that is to all the purpoſes that are neceſſary to their Spiritual Life, as the parallel plainly implies) upon them that ask him. So that all we can expect by vertue of theſe promiſes is only this, That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God will be ready to aid and aſſiſt us in all thoſe neceſſary caſes, wherein our Duty and Spiritual Life is concern'd; and therefore if there be no neceſſity of an immediate inſpiration of either Matter or Words to inable us to Pray, it is an unwarrantable preſumption
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:375"/> to expect it by vertue of theſe or ſuch like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                           <p>And that there is no neceſſity, I conceive, is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; for,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, As for the Matter of our Prayers, the Holy Spirit hath already ſufficiently reveal'd it to us in the Goſpel, and as plainly inſtructed us what we are to pray for, as he can be ſuppos'd to do by any immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo that with a very little conſideration, we may thence eaſily recollect what it is that we need, and what we are warranted and commanded to pray for; and for a ſummary of the whole, we need go no further than our Churches Catechiſm, which in anſwer to that Queſtion, after the Lord's Prayer, <hi>What deſireſt thou of God in this Prayer?</hi> ſums up the whole matter of our Prayer in a few, plain, and eaſie words. And to ſuppoſe, after ſuch a clear revelation of the matter of Prayer, a neceſſity of immediate inſpiration of it, is in effect to ſuppoſe, that we have neither reaſon enough to underſtand the ſenſe of plain words, nor memory enough to retain and recollect it. But againſt this, that paſſage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is objected by our Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings, which cannot be utter'd.</hi> For which words, <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought,</hi> they infer, that how plainly ſoever the matter of Prayer is reveal'd to us, we cannot in all caſes know what it is without an immediate inſpiration: which muſt either ſuppoſe, that all matter of Prayer is not plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to us, or that though it be, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; whereas the Apoſtles words imply neither the one nor t'other, for it's plain thoſe words, <hi>we know not what to pray for,</hi> are not to be underſtood ſimply, but with reference to, <hi>as we ought;</hi>

                              </gap>, <hi>for what to pray for as we ought, we know not;</hi> which plainly refers to the manner, and not to the matter of our Prayer, how to pray for any thing with that fervency of deſire, that dependance upon, and reſignation to God, as we ought, of our ſelves, we know not without the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God; if therefore the Spirit hath already ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveal'd to us, what the matter of Prayer is (as he muſt be ſuppos'd to do, if the Scriptures be ſufficient) I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould reveal it again by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſpiration; and if there be no neceſſity of it, I know no warrant we have to expect it. But then,</p>
                           <p>2. As for the Words of Prayer, by which we are to expreſs the Matter of it, what neceſſity can there be that theſe ſhould be immediately dictated to us, when as if we have not quickneſs enough of fancy and invention to expreſs our wants and deſires in our own words, we may readily ſupply that defect by Forms of Prayer of other Mens compoſure, which with very ſhort additions and variations of our own, we may eaſily adapt to all our particular caſes and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? and to imagin that with ſuch helps and aſſiſtances we cannot word our deſires to God without an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſpiration, is to ſuppoſe, that we are meer whiſpering Pipes, that can breath out nothing but what is breath'd into us.</p>
                           <p>3. That as there is neither promiſe, nor need of any ſuch immediate inſpiration of Prayer, ſo there is no certain ſign or teſtimony of it remaining among us: whenever God inſpir'd men with Divine matter and words, his Way was always to atteſt the divinity of their inſpiration with ſome certain ſign by which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others, might be well aſſur'd of it; and though at this diſtance from the inſpired Ages we cannot certainly determin by what token it was that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:376"/> the Prophets knew the divinity of their own inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions while they were ſeiz'd with them; yet this we know, that after they were deliver'd of them, God always took care to atteſt them by ſome miraculous operation: for ſo Miracles are ſtyled by the Apoſtle, the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, as being the conſtant ſigns and tokens of Divine inſpiration; and indeed without ſuch ſigns to diſtinguiſh it from falſe pretences, we were better be without inſpiration, than with it, becauſe we ſhall be left under an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable neceſſity, either of admitting all inſpirations which pretend to be divine, or of rejecting all that are truly ſo: as to inſtance in this caſe of Prayer, we know 'tis poſſible for men to have the matter and words of it dictated to them by a natural, or Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, as well as a Divine Enthuſiaſm, and therefore it is highly requiſit if ſuch Divine Enthuſiaſm, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, be continu'd to us, that the proper ſigns and teſtimonies of it ſhould be continu'd too, that ſo we may be able to diſtinguiſh that which is divine, from that which is natural or diabolical; otherwiſe we muſt either conclude them all to be natural, or diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, or believe them all to be divine, and entertain them accordingly.</p>
                           <p>If you ſay there is no need of either, becauſe the Scripture is ſufficient to diſtinguiſh them; I anſwer, that thought the Scripture may be ſufficient to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the matter of the inſpiration, whether it be true or falſe, yet it is not ſufficient to diſtinguiſh the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, whether it be divine, or natural, or diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical: For</p>
                           <p>Firſt, as for natural Enthuſiaſm, it is not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a man to pray agreeably to Scripture by natural inſpiration, by which I mean a natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental fervency of temper, ariſing either from a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:376"/> conſtant heat of conſtitution, or a caſual agitation of the ſpirits, occaſion'd either by vapours of heated me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or an intermixture of ſharp and feaveriſh humours with the blood; which as all men know, who underſtand any thing of the nature and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of humane bodies, naturally heightens and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnates the fancy, and cauſes the images of things to come faſter into it, and appear more diſtinct in it, and conſequently produces a very ready invention of matter, and extraordinary fluency of words: ſo that if under a fit of this natural fervency, a man's fancy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to run upon God and Religion, he cannot fail to pray with great readineſs and fluency, and ſometimes with that extraordinary paſſion and enlargement, as ſhall cauſe him aſſuredly to believe himſelf immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired by the Spirit of God: of the truth of which, inſtances enough might be given not only among Chriſtians, but alſo among the Devoto's of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the Poets and Orators of the Heathens, whoſe fancies have been very often ſo ſtrangely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by the fervour of their temper, or diſeaſe, that not only they themſelves, but they that heard them, believed that they were inſpired by God. Suppoſing then, that under a fit of this natural Enthuſiaſm a man ſhould pray agreeably to Scripture, how ſhall he be able to know by Scripture whether the preſent inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he is under, be natural, or divine? and how will it be poſſible for him to avoid, many times, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the natural effects of his temper, or diſeaſe, to the immediate operation of the Spirit of God?</p>
                           <p>But you will ſay, we all agree that the Spirit of God inſpires good men with holy and fervent affections in their Prayers, and yet it cannot be deni'd that this fervency of affection doth ſometimes alſo proceed from the preſent temper of our bodies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:377"/> which, we have no other ſign or teſtimony beſides that of Scripture, whereby to diſtinguiſh when 'tis divine, and when natural; doth not therefore the want of ſuch ſign as effectually conclude againſt the Spirits inſpiring the fervour of our Prayers, as againſt his inſpiring the matter and words of them? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, no; For, as for the former, we have a ſure word of promiſe, which we have not for the latter; and therefore if we can claim the promiſe, we have juſt reaſon to conclude when we feel our affections actually excited, that how much ſoever other cauſes might contribute to it, the Holy Spirit was the principal cauſe; but where we have no promiſe, we have no ground for ſuch concluſion: beſides which, we have no ſuch need of ſigns to enable us to diſtinguiſh in the one caſe, as in the other; For as for the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affection, we may eaſily diſtinguiſh whether it be natural or divine, by our own ſenſe; if our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fervour be accompanied with a fixt and conſtant devotion of ſoul, we may certainly conclude, that the ſame Spirit which inſpired the one, inſpired the other; and whether it be ſo accompanied or no, that natural ſenſe and feeling we have of our own motions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, will quickly inform us, and we have no more need of an outward ſign to ſatisfie us in this matter, than we have to know whether we are hungry or thirſty: but if the preſent fervour of our affections in Prayer be only a ſudden fit and pang of devotion, that finds and leaves us habitually indevout, we have juſt reaſon to conclude, that 'tis intirely owing to our preſent bodily temper: whether therefore our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in Prayer are inſpired by God, our own ſenſe will inform us, if we impartially conſult it; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our matter and words are ſo, no ſenſe we have can reſolve us: we may feel the matter of our Prayer pour in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:377"/> upon us with extraordinary readineſs, and be inabled to pour it out again with extraordinary fluency, and yet all this may proceed from our own fancy and invention, quickned and enlarg'd by meerly natural Enthuſiaſm; and therefore, unleſs we had ſome other ſign, beſides that of Scripture, 'twill be impoſſible for us to diſtinguiſh between a divine and natural inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter and words, becauſe that which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, may be as agreeable to Scripture, as that which is ſuppos'd to be divine; and God hath given us no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe to diſtinguiſh betweeen one and t'other: and can it be imagin'd that had he meant to continue this Gift of inſpiration to us, he would have thus left us in the dark concerning it, without any certain ſign whereby we might diſtinguiſh, whether it be from his Spirit, or from an ill-affected Spleen, or a Feaver?</p>
                           <p>But then, ſecondly, as for Diabolical Inſpirations of Matter and Words in Prayer we have ſundry very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Inſtances, ſuch as Major <hi>Weir,</hi> who is ſaid to have received his Inſpirations through a Staff, <hi>Hacket, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George,</hi> and that Monſter of wickedneſs <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilides</hi> Duke of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who were all of them poſſeſs'd with ſuch a wonderful Gift of Prayer, as did not only charm and raviſh thoſe that heard them, but ſeem'd, in the opinion of the moſt wiſe and impartial, to exceed the power of nature; which renders it very probable that the matter of their Prayers was for the moſt part agreeable to Scripture, otherwiſe 'tis hardly conceivable how they could have procured to themſelves ſo many admirers, and abuſed ſo many honeſt minds into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that they were immediately inſpired by God. And ſince by inſpiring his Votaries with ſuch matter of Prayer as is agreeable to Scripture, the Devil may ſometimes ſerve his own ends, ſince he may thereby puff up giddy minds with pride, and ſelf-conceit, and more effectually recommend Seducers and falſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:378"/> Teachers to the World; it's very reaſonable, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this ſubtle Agent who ſo throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his own game, will in ſome caſe be forward enough to do it: and if in any caſes we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſe, that the Devil may inſpire men with ſuch matter of Prayer as is agreeable to Scripture, then we can never certainly diſtinguiſh by Scripture, whether it be the Spirit of God, or the Devil, that inſpires us. And can we, without blaſpheming the goodneſs of God, imagin, that if he had continu'd this Gift of immediate inſpiration to us, he would have neglected to continue ſuch ſigns and teſtimonies of it as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to diſtinguiſh it from the inſpirations of the Devil? doubtleſs 'tis much better for us that this Gift ſhould be totally withdrawn, and that as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and expreſſions of our Prayer, we ſhould be left to the guidance of Scripture and Reaſon, than that by the continuance of it without ſome certain ſign to know and diſtinguiſh it, we ſhould be left under a fatal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, either of rejecting Divine Inſpirations, or of admitting Diabolical for Divine. And therefore ſince we have no ſuch ſign continu'd among us, we have all the reaſon in the world to conclude, that this Gift is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continu'd, and ceas'd: eſpecially conſidering that we have not only no certain ſign of any ſuch inſpiration in the conceiv'd Prayers of thoſe which moſt pretend to it, but many very certain ones of the contrary; I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in four.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The great impertinence, and nonſenſe, and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſay no worſe, that are ſometimes mingled with theſe <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers. I will not give Inſtances of this, becauſe it is ſo notorious, that our Brethren themſelves cannot but in part acknowledge it: now to attribute theſe faults of conceiv'd Prayers, to immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, would be to blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:378"/> father our own follies upon him, and yet ſure had he thought meet to have continu'd to the Church this Gift of inſpiration of Prayer, it would have been in order to the ſecuring the Worſhip of God from thoſe rudeneſſes and indecencies to which extemporary Prayers of mens own conceiving are liable; and if ſo, to be ſure in publick Prayer at leaſt, he would have conſtantly taken care to inſpire ſuch matter as is fit to be offer'd up to God, and ſuch expreſſions as are fit for ſuch matter; that ſo the Publick Worſhip of God, which is the moſt ſerious and ſolemn thing in the World, might not be render'd ridiculous by the folly and inadvertency of men. Whereas on the contrary, we ſee thoſe publick Prayers which arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the honour of being inſpired, are generally more liable to theſe indecencies, than Forms of humane compoſure, and that thoſe Prayers which conſiſt of premeditated matter and words, are commonly much better ſenſe, and far more decent and pertinent, than our extemporary effuſions; which how it ſhould come to paſs I know not, ſuppoſing the continuance of inſpiration of Prayer, unleſs we will ſuppoſe, that Humane Compoſures may exceed Divine Inſpirations, and that men may ordinarily premeditate better Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than the Spirit of God inſpires. And methinks it ſeems very ſtrange, that the Spirit ſhould continue this Gift of inſpiration to ſecure the Worſhip of God from nonſenſe and impertinence, and yet that after all, it ſhould remain more liable to theſe indecencies, than if our publick Prayers were offered up in premeditated Forms, compoſed out of our own or other mens inventions</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Another ſign that our compoſed Prayers are not immediately inſpired is, that they are ſo generally tinctur'd with the particular opinions of thoſe that offer them. You may obſerve that in all publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:379"/> of Religion, mens Opinions are generally to be known by their Prayers, eſpecially if they zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly eſpouſe either ſide of the Queſtion: for then the debate runs ſo much in their heads, and they look upon God and Religion ſo very highly concern'd in it, that they can hardly frame a Petition, Confeſſion, or thankſgiving, without giving ſome intimation of their particular Perſwaſion; and many times one of the Petitions is, <hi>That God would hinder the propagation of the contrary Perſwaſion, and convince their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the Error and Falſhood of it.</hi> Thus for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when the Conteſt ran high between the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> how eaſie was it to diſtinguiſh them by their Prayers from one another? Whether this be not ſo, I appeal to our Brethren themſelves, and to all the World? And if ſo, what plainer evidence can be given, that their Prayers were not inſpired, but of their own invention, and compoſure? For either we muſt ſuppoſe this Gift of Inſpiration to be confin'd to one Party, which would be to ſtint the Spirit with a witneſs, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly to puzzle our ſelves where to find it, among ſo many contending Parties that pretend to it; or elſe we muſt affirm a horrid Blaſphemy, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirit inſpires Contradictions, and indites contrary Prayers to men of oppoſite Parties.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Another plain ſign that our conceiv'd Prayers are not immediately inſpired is, That that which gives them the reputation of being ſo, is not ſo much the matter, as the way and manner of expreſſing them. For as for the matter of Prayer, I ſuppoſe our Brethren will not deny, but our Forms may equal at leaſt, if not exceed their conceiv'd and extemporary Prayers, and that 'tis poſſible for men, upon mature thoughts and deliberations, to compoſe and pen a Prayer, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:379"/> ſhall be as full and comprehenſive of the common caſes, and neceſſities of Chriſtians, as if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and indited it upon the place. And if all the matter that is in a conceiv'd Prayer, may be eaſily contain'd and expreſs'd in a Form, then all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between one and t'other muſt lie in the way, and manner of expreſſing it, and conſequently it muſt be only upon this account, that the one muſt pretend to inſpiration more than t'other. Now there are only two differences between Forms, and conceived Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as to the way, and manner of expreſſing the matter in them; neither of which are ſo conſiderable, as to give the one a fairer pretence to inſpiration than the other: The firſt is, that whereas the matter of a Form of Prayer is expreſs'd in ſet, and premeditated words, the ſame matter in conceiv'd Prayer is expreſs'd in extemporary words; and is it not ſtrange, that upon ſuch a ſlight, and inconſiderable difference, the one ſhould be thought to be more inſpired than the other? as if the Spirit of God continu'd the Gift of Inſpiration to no other purpoſe, but to inable men to ask thoſe Bleſſings in extemporary words, which they might as well have askt in premeditated ones. The ſecond is, that conceiv'd Prayers do generally more inlarge and amplifie on the matter of Prayer, than Forms, in which we being always tied to ſuch a ſet of words, have not that liberty to expatiate on our ſeveral caſes, and neceſſities; but this is ſo far from adding to the value of conceiv'd Prayers, that it rather leſſens, and depreciates them; for if you obſerve theſe admired enlargements, and amplifications, are generally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but only the ſame matter expreſs'd again in different words, which makes our conceiv'd Prayers run out many times to that inordinate length, the ſame matter being repeated in them over and over in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:380"/> varied phraſes and expreſſions: how then can we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch mean conceits of the wiſdom of the holy Spirit, as to imag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>n he would continue to us the Gift of immediate inſpiration, meerly to enable us to repeat the ſame matter of Prayer to God ten or twenty times over, in different phraſes and expreſſions? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that by ſo doing he would croſs the orders of our Saviour, who expreſly forbids us in our Prayers to <hi>uſe vain repetitions,</hi> (or as <hi>Munſter</hi>'s <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> reads it, <hi>to multiply words above what is fit and ſeaſonable) thinking we ſhall be heard for our much ſpeaking;</hi> to which he ſubjoins this reaſon, <hi>For your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask him,</hi> Matth. 6. 7, 8. As if he ſhould have ſaid you need not lengthen out your Prayers with ſo many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious enlargements, and varied repetitions of the ſame matter, as if you meant thereby more fully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct your Father in your wants and deſires, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever you ask, he knows your needs, and therefore a few words will ſuffice to expreſs your deſires to him, And when our Saviour hath required that our Prayers ſhould be ſhort, and pithy, and ſtript of all needleſs multiplicity of words, what reaſon have we to think that the Holy Spirit, who is his Vice-gerent in the Church, would continue the Gift of Inſpiration meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to amplifie and enlarge them? Theſe enlargements of conceiv'd Prayer therefore, are ſo far from being, ſigns of their immediate inſpiration, that ſuppoſing the Spirit to be of the ſame mind with our Saviour, they are generally ſigns of the contrary.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Another plain ſign that our conceiv'd Prayers are not immediately inſpired is, That that extraordinary manner, and way of expreſſing them, for which they are thought to be inſpired, doth apparently proceed from natural cauſes: for, as I ſhew'd before, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:380"/> why our conceiv'd Prayers are thought by us and others to be inſpired is, that we are many times enabled in them to enlarge extempore, with ſo much readineſs, and fluency: which may be eaſily reſolv'd into meer natural Enthuſiaſm, or preſent fervour of temper. And that from hence this fluency and enlargement in Prayer doth ordinarily proceed, ſeems very evident by two undeniable ſigns; firſt, that according to our Brethrens own confeſſion, it comes upon them much oftener in their publick, than in their private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For this is an ordinary caſe in their Divinity; how comes it to paſs that good men often find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo enlarg'd in their publick and ſo ſtrengthen'd in their private Prayers? And indeed, ſuppoſing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did ordinarily inſpire the matter and words of their Prayer, I ſee not how it could be well reſolv'd, unleſs we ſuppoſe the Spirit to be more concern'd to inſpire us with fluency of matter and words, when we are to ſpeak before men, than when we are only to ſpeak before God. The true reſolution therefore of the caſe is this, that in our private Prayers we want the ſighs, and groans, and paſſionate geſtures of a devout Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to chafe and excite our affections, and the reverence of a numerous Auditory, to oblige us to teaz and wrack our inventions; for want of which our ſpirits are not ordinarily ſo vehemently agitated and heated as when we Pray in publick; where being more than ordinarily warm'd, partly with our own efforts and ſtruglings, to invent, and partly with the warmths and pious fervours of the Congregation, we are many times tranſported by this natural Enthuſiaſm, into raptures of paſſion and inlargement; this I ſay is the only reaſon that can be aſſign'd of it, unleſs we will ſuppoſe that which is very unſuppoſeable of the Spirit of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is more ſolicitous to indite our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:381"/> Prayers when we are in the preſence of men, than when we are only in the preſence of God. Secondly, Another ſign that this admired fluency and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Prayer proceeds from meer natural Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm is this, that generally in the beginning of the Prayer they find themſelves ſtreighten'd and confin'd, both as to the matter and words of it, till they have Pray'd on for a while, and then they grow more ready and fluent; which how it ſhould come to paſs, I know not, ſuppoſing the Prayer were inſpired, unleſs perhaps the Spirit comes in only in the middle, or towards the latter end of their Prayer, but leaves them to their own invention in the beginning, and what reaſon there ſhould be for ſuch an imagination, I confeſs I am not able to gueſs. The true account therefore of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this, that in the beginning of the Prayer their Spirits are uſually dull, and ſluggiſh, and do not flow and reflow ſo briskly to their heads and hearts as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they have been throughly chaft and heated with a labour and exerciſe of invention; by which being excited and awaken'd, they naturally raiſe the drooping fancy, and render the invention more copious, fluent, and eaſie. So that meerly by the Laws of Matter and Motion, as plain an account may be given of this extemporary fluency, and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Prayer, as of any other natural effect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and therefore for our Brethren to attibute to the immediate inſpiration of the Spirit of God, that which hath ſuch apparent ſigns of its derivation from natural cauſes, is, I conceive, very unwarrantable. By all which, I think, it's very evident, not only that we have no ſign of the continuance of this Gift of Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Prayer remaining among us, but that we have manifeſt ſigns of the contrary.</p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:381"/>
                           <p>4. And laſtly, That to ſuppoſe the continuance of this Gift of Inſpiration of Prayer, is to ſuppoſe more than our Brethren themſelves will allow of, <hi>viz.</hi> That their conceiv'd Prayers are infallible, and of equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Word of God. For if our Prayers are dictated to us by the Spirit of God, they muſt be as infallible as he, whoſe infinite knowledge cannot ſuffer him to be deceiv'd, and whoſe infinite veracity will not admit him to deceive: and if ſo, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he dictates, or inſpires, muſt be remov'd from all poſſibility of error, or miſtake; and conſequently our Prayers muſt be ſo too, ſuppoſing he inſpires the matter and words of them. And as they muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in themſelves, ſo they muſt be of equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with Scripture: for that which gives the Scriptures the authority of the Word of God, is, their being inſpired by the Spirit of God, and therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever matter or words are ſo inſpired, are as much the Word of God, as any matter or words in Scripture: <hi>All Scripture is given,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God.</hi> And therefore whatſoever is given by his Inſpiration, muſt neceſſarily be his Word: for what thoſe Holy Men of God ſpake, who deliver'd the Scripture, they ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and therefore what they deliver'd was the Word of God, becauſe their Mouths were the Oracles through which God ſpake; if therefore when we Pray, we are mov'd, as they were, by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration of God, what we pray, muſt be as much the Word of God, as what they ſpake. So that either our Brethren muſt affirm, that their conceiv'd Prayers are of equal authority with Scripture, (which I am ſure no ſober Diſſenter will preſume) or deny that they are immediately inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:382"/>
                           <p>And thus I have ſhewn what thoſe extraordinary Operations are, which the Scripture attributes to the Spirit in Prayer. I proceed in the next place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what the ordinary and ſtanding Operations are, which the Scripture attributes to him, and which he hath promiſed to continue to the end of the World. Of which I ſhall give but a very brief account, becauſe herein we are all agreed.</p>
                           <p>In ſhort therefore, the ordinary Operations of the Spirit conſiſt in exciting in us the graces and proper affections of Prayer, ſuch as ſhame and ſorrow in the confeſſion of our ſins, a ſenſe of our need of mercy, and a hope of obtaining it in our ſupplications for pardon, reſignation to God's will, and dependance on his goodneſs in our Prayers for temporal mercies, and deliverances, hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs in our Petitions for his grace and aſſiſtance, and in a word, gratitude, and love, and admiration of God in our Praiſes and Thankſgivings for Mercy. For in theſe divine and gracious Affections, the life and ſoul of Prayer conſiſts: as for the Words and Expreſſions of it, about which our Brethren diſagree with us, they are of no other account with God, than as they ſignifie to him the graces and affections of our Prayers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he regards them no more, than he doth the whiſtling of the wind; and therefore ſince theſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the main of our Prayer, and words are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his account in compariſon with them; can any man be ſo vain as to imagin, that thoſe affections will be ever a whit the leſs acceptable to him, becauſe they are preſented in a form of words, and not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Effuſions? Sure that Father would be very capricious, that ſhould deny Bread to his hungry Child, meerly becauſe he askt it to day in the ſame words that he did yeſterday; and to imagin that God
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:382"/> will diſlike or reject the good affections of our Prayer, meerly becauſe they are every day expreſs'd in the ſame form, is to ſuppoſe him a very captious Being, and one that is more taken with our words, than with our affections: the contrary of which he hath given ſufficient proof of in this very particular, in that whereas he hath withdrawn from us as I have prov'd at large) the inſpiration of the words of our Prayer, and left them to the compoſure of our own or other mens invention; he ſtill continues to inſpire us with the affections of Prayer, and to excite them to a due activity. For to this, among other purpoſes, it is, that he hath promiſed to continue his Holy Spirit to us, to enable us to addreſs our ſelves to him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and holy affections: thus <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba father:</hi> that is, by kindling devout and filial affections in your ſouls, inabling you to cry to God with all earneſtneſs and aſſurance, as to a kind and merciful Father: and hence alſo we are ſaid to Pray in or by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. it being by him that thoſe good affections are rais'd in us that we offer up to God in our Prayers: and therefore we may well be ſaid to Pray by the Spirit, becauſe 'tis by the Spirit that we are inſpired with thoſe holy affections which are the ſoul of our Prayer; and accordingly the Spirit is ſaid to <hi>make interceſſion for us with ſighs and groans, which are not to be uttered, Rom.</hi> 8. 26. which words are far from aſſerting the inſpiration of the matter and words of our Prayer, though they are urg'd by our Brethren for that purpoſe: for as for the matter of Prayer, here is not the leaſt hint of the Spirits inſpiring it, for as to that, the Chriſtians, whom he ſpeaks of, were well inſtructed already by their Chriſtian inſtitution; but all that is affirm'd, is,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:383"/> that the Spirit inabled them to offer up the matter of Prayer to God in a moſt devout and affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; with ſighs and groans, that is, with earneſt and flagrant affections. And as for the words of Prayer, the Text is ſo far from implying the inſpiration of them, that it plainly tells us, that thoſe ſighs and groans which the Spirit inſpired, were ſuch as were not to be utter'd or worded. And ſurely to inſpire us with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are too big for words, cannot imply the inſpiration of words. So that the Spirit's interceeding for us with ſighs and groans that are not to be utter'd, can imply no more, than his exciting in us the proper affections of Prayer; and in this ſenſe he is ſaid in the next Verſe, <hi>to make interceſſion for the Saints ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, viz.</hi> by inabling them to offer up the matter of Prayer to God with ſuch fervent and devout affections as are neceſſary to render it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him: which is properly to interceed for us; for as Chriſt, who is our Advocate in Heaven, doth offer up our Prayers to the Father, and inforce them with his own interceſſions; ſo his Spirit, who is our Advocate upon Earth, begets in us thoſe affections which render our Prayers prevalent, and wings them with fervour and ardency: the one pleads with God for us in our own hearts, by kindling ſuch deſires there as render our Prayers acceptable to him; and the other pleads with him for us in Heaven, by preſenting thoſe deſires, and ſoliciting their ſupply and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And thus you ſee what that ſtanding and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Operation is which the Scripture attributes to the Spirit in Prayer.</p>
                           <p>And now, before I proceed to determin the preſent caſe, I ſhall only farther inquire, what is means by that Phraſe of ſtinting and limiting the Spirit. In ſhort therefore, to ſtint or limit the Spirit, is a modern
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:383"/> Phraſe, of which there is not the leaſt intimation in Scripture, or Antiquity; but 'tis a term of Art coin'd and invented by our Brethren, and appli'd only to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent controverſie, concerning the lawfulneſs of Forms of Prayer. Which, by the way, is a plain evidence that this argument againſt Forms, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſtint the Spirit, is very new, ſince, though Forms of Prayer were uſed not only in the Scripture Ages, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, but alſo in all ſucceſſive Ages of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet, till very lately, we never heard one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of ſtinting or limiting the Spirit by them.</p>
                           <p>The meaning of which Phraſe is this; That by uſing Forms of Prayer, we hinder the Spirit from affording us ſome aſſiſtance in Prayer, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we might reaſonably expect from them: for ſo our Brethren explain the Phraſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That by confining our ſelves to a Form of Words, we reſtrain the Spirit from giving us that aſſiſtance, which he ordinarily vouchſafes in conceiv'd Prayer.</p>
                           <p>And now, having fully ſtated the Caſe, the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it will be ſhort and eaſie. It hath been ſhewn at large, that there are two ſorts of aſſiſtances in Prayer which the Scripture attributes to the Spirit; the firſt extraordinary, and temporary; <hi>viz.</hi> the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration of the matter, and words of Prayer: the ſecond ordinary, and abiding; <hi>viz.</hi> exciting the devotion, and proper affections of Prayer: If therefore the Spirit be ſtinted, hinder'd, or reſtrain'd, by Forms of Prayer, it muſt be either from inſpiring the words and matter, or from exciting the affections of Prayer; as for the latter, to which this Phraſe of ſtinting is never apply'd by our Brethren, I ſhall diſcourſe of it at large in the third Caſe, wherein I ſhall endeavour to prove, that Forms of Prayer are ſo far from reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the devotion of it, that they very much promote
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:384"/> and improve it. And as for the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the matter and words of Prayer, that I have prov'd was extraordinary, and intended only as other miraculous Gifts were, for the firſt propagation of the Goſpel; and therefore ſince as to this matter, the Spirit hath ſtinted himſelf, it's certain, that Forms of Prayer cannot ſtint him; for how can that be ſtinted which is not? and if now there be no ſuch thing as immediate inſpiration of Prayer, how can it be limited by a Form of Prayer? In a word, if the Spirit of his own accord hath long ſince withdrawn this Gift of inſpiration, how can it be now ſaid that he is reſtrain'd from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it by any cauſe without him?</p>
                        </div>
                        <div n="2" type="case">
                           <head>Caſe II. <hi>Whether the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Publick Forms, be not a ſinful neglect of the Miniſterial Gift of Prayer?</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>In order to the reſolution of which Caſe, it would be neceſſary to give a brief ſtate of it, according as it is put, and urg'd by our Brethren. By the Gift of Prayer then, they mean an ability to expreſs our minds to God in Prayer, or to offer up our deſires and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to him in words, befitting the matter of them: which ability, ſay they, is given by God to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as a means of publick Prayer, and in order to their being the Mouths of their Congregations to God, to repreſent to him the common Caſes and Neceſſities of their People; and therefore ſince God, ſay they, hath given us this Gift, as a means of publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in order to our offering up the Prayers of the People, it may be juſtly queſtion'd, whether we may lawfully omit the uſe of it, by uſing publick Forms of other mens compoſure.</p>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:384"/>
                           <p>Now, before I enter into a particular conſideration of this Caſe, I ſhall briefly premiſe theſe two things:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That this Caſe concerns the Clergy only, and not the Laity: For ſuppoſe that it be unlawful for Miniſters to omit the uſe of their own abilities to expreſs the Devotions of their Congregations, what is that to the People? are they accountable for their Miniſters faults? or will God reject their ſincere Devotions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Perſon that utters them is guilty of a ſinful omiſſion? if ſo, it will be of dangerous conſequence to them to joyn in any publick Prayers at all, whether they be Forms, or Extemporary; they being every whit as accountable for the nonſenſe, impertinence, and irreverence of their Miniſters in the latter, as for their omitting the uſe of their own abilities in the former: if therefore this omiſſion be a ſin, it is the ſin of the Miniſter; as for the People, they joyn with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in offering up the matter of Prayer, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Form he pronounces, but they join not with him in the omiſſion of the uſe of his ability; that is his own proper act, and deed; and therefore if it be unlawful, it's he, and he only that is accountable for it: and if the matter of Prayer in which they join with him be good, and expreſs'd in decent and ſuitable words, they join with him in nothing but what is acceptable to God, and 'tis not to be imagin'd that God will be angry with them, becauſe he neglected to expreſs their deſires in words of his own compoſure and invention.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. I ſhall alſo premiſe, that this is not the caſe of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who, though they ſtand obliged to the conſtant uſe of a ſtated Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, yet are not hereby reſtrain'd from the exerciſe of their own abilities in publick Prayer: for after they have finiſh'd the Service appointed in the Liturgy, they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:385"/> are permitted to uſe their own conceiv'd Prayers in the Pulpit: in which they have the ſame liberty, that the diſſenting Miniſters can claim or pretend to; that is, to expreſs in their own words all the matter of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer, with all the ſobriety, affection, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs they are able; And a long and unreſtrain'd permiſſion of our Governours, though it be againſt Law, is a kind of allowance, untill they reinforce the Law upon our parties, and ſome there are who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the conceiv'd Prayers which we generally uſe to be expreſly allow'd in our 55th Canon, which directs, <hi>that before all Sermons, Lectures, and Homilies, the Preachers and Miniſters ſhall move the People to join with them in Prayer, in this form, or to this effect, as briefly as conveniently they may.</hi> Now that, <hi>to this effect,</hi> as it ſtands oppoſed to <hi>this form,</hi> is meant ſome Prayer of our own, compoſed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſeems in their opinion very probable from what is generally practiſed in the Church, which in doubtful caſes, is the beſt explication of her meaning. Since therefore the uſe of our Liturgy doth not exclude the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our Gift of Prayer, But leaves us free to exert it, ſo far as it is fit, that is, with <hi>convenient brevity,</hi> I ſee not how this Caſe can concern our Clergy; for if the evil of Forms conſiſts in the Miniſters omiſſion of his own Gift, as this Caſe ſuppoſes, then where the uſe of Forms doth not oblige us to this omiſſion, but leaves us as free to exerciſe this Gift, as thoſe are who uſe no Forms at all, the ſuppoſed evil is remov'd from it.</p>
                           <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall proceed to a particular reſolution of the Caſe, which I ſhall do in theſe following Propoſitions.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That this Miniſterial Gift of Prayer, or ability to expreſs in our own words, the common Devotions of our Congregations to God, is either natural, or acquir'd. 'Tis true, if we had any reaſon to believe, that in their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:385"/> admiſſion to holy Orders, God did inſpire his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with this ability, we might thence more plauſibly infer, that 'twas his will that we ſhould ordinarily exerciſe it, and that it was not lawful to neglect or omit it, by uſing Forms of other mens compoſure; it being unlikely that God ſhould inſpire them with an ability, which he did not intend they ſhould make uſe of: but of Gods inſpiring us in our Ordination with this Gift, or Ability, we have not only no promiſe in Scripture, which is the only foundation upon which we can reaſonably expect it; but in fact, we have no experience of any ſuch matter among us: for not only we, but the Diſſenting Miniſters muſt own, if they will ſpeak ingenuouſly, that juſt before their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were as able to expreſs the Devotions of a Congregation, as they were juſt after; which ſhews that they had no new ability to Pray, inſpired in their Ordination: and as yet, I could never find any proof, either from Scripture, or Experience, that this ability to Pray in words of our own compoſure, had any thing more in it, than a promptneſs of invention and ſpeech; which ſome men have by nature, and which others have acquired by art and practice; and if ſo, this ability is no otherwiſe the Gift of God, than our natural ſtrength and vigour, or our skill in Languages and Hiſtory. And methinks it's very ſtrange, that after all this talk of the gift of Prayer, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ordinarily at leaſt to be conferr'd on rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters, our Brethren ſhould not be able to produce one Promiſe, wherein God hath ingag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to confer it; no nor one Text of Scripture, which implies ſuch a Promiſe; all that he hath promiſed his Miniſters is, to concur with their honeſt indeavours, ſo far forth as it's neceſſary to inable them to diſcharge the Duties of their Office, and to ſuppoſe that they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:386"/> cannot do this, without praying <hi>Extempore,</hi> or in their own words, is to take the matter in queſtion, for granted.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That this natural or acquired Gift, is no where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated by God to prayer, but left common to other uſes, and purpoſes; For though in Miniſters eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is ordinarily called a Gift of Prayer, yet it is no where ſtiled ſo in Scripture: indeed the ability of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in unknown languages, is once called a Gift, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, but as for this ordinary ability, whether natural, or acquir'd, of praying in our native language, it is no where ſpoken of in Scripture, under the name of a Gift of Prayer, nor is there the leaſt mention of any ſuch ability given by God to men, purely to inable them to pray, and unleſs our Brethren can produce ſome Text of Scripture, which yet they never attempted, wherein God hath appropriated this Gift to the purpoſe of Prayer, they muſt give us leave to conclude, that he hath left it common to all other honeſt uſes, and purpoſes that it can be apply'd to; and that in ſhort, it is nothing but a freedom of Utterance, and Elocution, which in ſome is natural, and in ſome acquired, by which they are enabled readily to expreſs their minds to God, or men; and therefore to how many honeſt purpoſes this common Gift of God is applicable, to ſo many it's deſign'd, and intended; and conſequently, may as well be call'd the Gift of Converſation in good company, and the Gift of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Bar, and the Gift of diſputing in the Schools, or the Gift of Oratory in the <hi>Forum,</hi> as the Gift of Prayer in Private, or Publick worſhip; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all but one and the ſame Gift applied to ſeveral uſes, and purpoſes; accordingly we find that thoſe who have this Gift, have it not only while they are ſpeaking in Prayer, but when they are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:386"/> upon other occaſions; and that ordinarily they can expreſs themſelves to Men with the ſame readineſs, and fluency in converſation, as they expreſs their minds to God in Prayer, which is a plain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that their Gift is not appropriate to Prayer, but common to all the other uſes, and purpoſes of Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That this Gift of utterance not being appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to Prayer, may upon juſt reaſon, be as lawfully omitted in Prayer, as in any other uſe or purpoſe 'tis deſigned for: I do confeſs had God any where appropriated it to the end of Prayer, thoſe who have it, were obliged to uſe it to that end, and to omit it ordinarily, by confining themſelves to forms of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens inditing, would be to neglect a means of Prayer of Gods ſpecial appointment and inſtitution; for had he any where intimated to us, that he gave it us purely to inable us to pray without any reſpect to any other end, we could not have omitted the uſe of it in Prayer without croſſing his intention, and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him of the only end for which he intended it, but ſince he hath given us no ſuch intimation, we may juſtly conclude that he intends it in common for all thoſe honeſt ends to which it is applicable, and if ſo, 'tis no more unlawful to omit uſing it to one end than to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſo that either it muſt be wholly unlawful to omit uſing our own Elocution to any purpoſe whatſoever whereunto it may be honeſtly applied, or it muſt be lawful to omit it in Prayer, and conſequently ſuppoſing I have this Gift of utterance, either I may not uſe a form in petitioning my Prince, or a Court of Juſtice, or I may uſe a form in addreſſing my ſelf to God in Prayer, ſince my Gift is common to both theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and no more appropriated to the one than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in ſhort therefore, as for thoſe common Gifts of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:387"/> God which are applicable to ſundry purpoſes, and which he intends no more for one than for another, it is left to our own liberty and diſcretion, whether we will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to this or that particular purpoſe or no, and no man is obliged to uſe his Gift to all thoſe juſt and lawful purpoſes it is capable of, and if he hath two Gifts which ſerve to the ſame purpoſe, there is no doubt but he may lawfully omit the one, and uſe the other as he ſees occaſion; and ſo it is with this Gift of utterance, which is naturally ſerviceable to ſundry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent purpoſes, and among others to this of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our minds to God in Prayer, but it being ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this in common with others, it is left to our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whether we will imploy it in this, in that, or in another purpoſe, and we are neither obliged to imploy it in all, nor in this more than in another, but if we have another Gift that is ſerviceable to the purpoſe of Prayer as well as this of utterance, it is left to our own pious diſcretion whether we will uſe this or the other; ſo that unleſs our Brethren can prove that this Gift of Utterance or Elocution is by ſpecial command of God made an appropriate means of Publick Prayer, they will never be able to prove, either that it is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to omit the uſe of it in Prayer, than in any other Office of Elocution, or that if we have any other means of Prayer, we are determined to this more than to another.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That to read our deſires to God in other Mens Words, is as much a means of Prayer, as to ſpeak them in our own, for to ſpeak in our own Words, is no otherwiſe a means of Publick Prayer, than as it ſerves to expreſs to God the Common caſes and neceſſities of the Congregation, and if theſe may be as well expreſt by Reading them in other Mens Words, as by ſpeaking them in our own, the end of Publick
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:387"/> Prayer is as effectually ſerv'd by the one, as by the other, and ſure no man will deny, but that by a Form of Words compoſed by another, he may expreſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Devotions of a Congregation, as well as by extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore or premeditated words of his own invention; for this would be in effect to ſay, that none but himſelf can compoſe a publick Prayer, or at leaſt none ſo well as he; for if another Prayer may be as expreſſive of the Devotions of a Congregation as his own, I can ſee no reaſon why the reading of that may not be as proper a means of publick Prayer, as the ſpeaking of this; here then are two means of Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> reading other mens Forms, and ſpeaking our own Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore unleſs our Brethren can prove, that God hath expreſly choſen the one, and rejected the other, they muſt acknowledge both to be lawful; and if we cannot lawfully omit the one, becauſe it is a means of Prayer, neither can we lawfully omit the other, becauſe it is ſo too; and therefore either we muſt be obliged to uſe them both, which is impoſſible at the ſame time, or we muſt be left at liberty to uſe either, according to our own diſcretion. In ſum therefore, ſince we are not inſpired with any peculiar Gift of Prayer in our ordination, and ſince our Gift of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our own words is not appropriated by God to this uſe, but left in common to other purpoſes, and ſince what is not appropriated by God, may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully omitted, when there are other means of Prayer, and ſince in fact there is another means of Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this of praying in our own words, <hi>viz.</hi> praying in the words of others, which God hath left as free to us as the former, it plainly follows from the whole, that to omit the uſe of our own Gift, and in the ſtead of it to uſe that other Gift of praying in the words of others, is not in it ſelf any way ſinful or unlawful.</p>

                           <head>Caſe III. <hi>Whether the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Publick Forms of Prayer doth not deaden the Devotion of Prayer?</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>For thus our Brethren argue, that by the command of God we are obliged not only to pray, but to pray with the utmoſt devotion we are able, and accordingly to uſe ſuch means of Prayer as are moſt apt to heighten and intend our devotion, and thus far we agree with them; if therefore Forms are in themſelves, and not through our fault and erroneous prejudice, leſs apt to quicken and raiſe devotion than conceiv'd Prayers, it will be granted of all hands, that this is a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the uſe of them. This therefore is the caſe wherein we differ, our Brethren ſay, that Forms of Publick Worſhip, (for 'tis that we are now diſcourſing of) are in themſelves apt to diſpirit and deaden the Devotions of thoſe that uſe them; we ſay the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that publick Forms are in themſelves more apt to improve and quicken the common Devotions, than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Prayers of the Miniſters own conceiving: In order therefore to the clearing and full reſolution of this Caſe, we will briefly enquire into theſe three things:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What theſe advantages to Publick Devotion are, which conceived, or extemporary Prayers pretend to?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Whether theſe Advantages are not for the moſt part fantaſtical and imaginary, and whether ſo far as they are real they are not much more peculiar to Forms than to extempore Prayer?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Whether beſides theſe common advantages pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Forms have not peculiar advantages, which conceiv'd Prayers cannot pretend to?</p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:388"/>
                           <p n="1">1. We will enquire what thoſe advantages to the publick Devotions are which conceiv'd or extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Prayers pretend to; in ſhort, it is pretended in the behalf of conceiv'd Prayers, that they do much more fix the attention, and raiſe the intention of the Peoples minds in Prayer, than publick Forms; that is, that they do more confine the rovings of mens thoughts in Prayer, and keep their minds more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to it, and that they do much more warm and enliven their affections in it; for, ſay our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Devotions of the people are very much rais'd or deaden'd by the performance of the Miniſter, according as he is more or leſs devout in it; and as for the Miniſter, he muſt needs be much more devout in a Prayer of his own conceiving, than in the uſe of a publick Form; becauſe firſt, ſay they, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to keep his mind ſo attentive in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prayer, as in conceiving one in his own mind, and ſpeaking it from his own conceptions; the care of performing which naturally bounds the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his thoughts, and keeps them more fixt and attentive; and ſecondly, becauſe when he utters his words immediately from his affections, his thoughts have not that ſcope to wander, as when he reads them out of a Book. And as conceived Prayer doth more fix the attention of the Miniſter, ſo it doth alſo more raiſe his intention, or in other words, more warm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame his affections; for firſt, whereas in reading a Form, his affections follow his words, and are raiſed and excited by them, in conceived Prayer, his words follow his affections, and are immediately utter'd from, and indited by them; and ſecondly, How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſay they, that the words of another, which he reads out of a Form, ſhould ſo well expreſs his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:389"/> as his own; beſides, thirdly, that while he is reading his Form, his ſoul is ſo intent in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his eye to read, that it cannot direct its affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to God with that fervour and intention as it might do in conceiv'd Prayer. Theſe are the ſuppoſed helps which the Miniſters devotion, and from his the Peoples receive from conceiv'd Prayers, above what Forms of Prayer can afford: and as conceiv'd Prayer hath theſe peculiar advantages to raiſe the Miniſters devotion, and by his the Peoples, ſo it hath another advantage by which it more immediately influences the devotion of the People, <hi>viz.</hi> that the matter of it is ſtill expreſt in new words, which muſt needs much more affect the attention of the People, than when it is always expreſt in the ſame words without any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation; And this, ſo far as I can gather from the Writings of our Brethren, is the ſum of what they plead in behalf of conceiv'd Prayer, as to its peculiar advantageouſneſs to publick Devotion above ſtated Forms.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Therefore we will inquire whether theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are not in a great meaſure imaginary, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo far as they are real, they are not much more peculiar to Forms, than to conceiv'd Prayer. And here I will readily grant, that by expreſſing a ſerious and devout affection, the Miniſter doth really advantage the Devotion of the Congregation, even as by his good example in all other things he excites the people to a pious and virtuous imitation; in whoſe eyes devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never looks ſo amiable, as when 'tis expreſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and well compos'd words, accompanied with a devout, a ſober, and affectionate behaviour: both which are equally neceſſary to excite the devotion of the People: if therefore it be really true, that the uſe of conceived or extempore Prayer is in its own nature
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:389"/> moſt apt to fix the attention, and excite the intention of the Miniſter in Prayer, it muſt be confeſt that herein it hath the advantage of Forms. 1. Therefore we will inquire whether theſe advantages it pretends to, as to the exciting the Miniſters attention in Prayer, be real, or no: The firſt advantage is, that the very conceiving the matter of his Prayer, and ſpeaking it from his own conceptions, doth naturally more bind his attention, than the reading it out of a Form; but I beſeech you, what doth it more bind him to attend to? is it to attend to the words and phraſes? if ſo, then 'tis not to attend to the acts of Prayer, or is it to attend to thoſe acts which are the proper buſineſs of Prayer? that is to be aſham'd of ſin, and to bewail it in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be ſenſible of the common wants, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dependancies upon God for ſupply in petition, to admire God's perfections, and gratefully commemorate his goodneſs in praiſe and thankſgiving; for in theſe things the true devotion both of Miniſter and People conſiſts; and 'tis only by being an example of theſe in his Prayer, that the Miniſter excites the devotion of his people: 'tis by confeſſing ſin, as if he were aſham'd of, and ſorry for it, that he excites their ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; by petitioning for mercy, as if he were ſenſible of the want of it, and did heartily deſire it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon God for it, that he excites their ſenſe of need, and their deſire, and hope of relief, and ſupply; by praiſing and thanking God, as if he heartily admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his excellencies, and gratefully reſented his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he excites their admiration and gratitude; that mode of Prayer therefore which is moſt apt to fix the Miniſters attention to theſe acts of devotion, muſt needs be moſt apt to excite the devotions of the people: Now as for the mode of praying from his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, I really think that it is much more apt to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:390"/> unfix the Miniſters attention to theſe acts, than that of praying by a Form; becauſe it forces him to attend to other things at the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> the recollection of matter, and invention of ſutable expreſſions, which muſt more or leſs divert him from attending to the inward acts of devotion, according as his fancy and tongue are more or leſs pregnant and voluble; it being impoſſible for him to attend at the ſame time, to ſeveral things, as cloſely as he may to one: but when he prays by a Form, his matter and words are ready before him, and ſo he hath nothing elſe to do, but to attend to his devotion; and certainly when a man hath but one thing to do in Prayer, he may attend to that more fixedly and cloſely, than when he hath two or three: 'tis true, by being releaſed from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the invention of his matter and words, his mind is more at leiſure to wander, and inſtead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as he ought more cloſely to the acts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by imploying thoſe thoughts which in conceiv'd Prayer he imploys in invention, in a cloſer attention to the acts of devotion, he may, if he pleaſe, permit them to rove abroad; but if he doth, the fault is in himſelf, and not in the Form he prays by: the deſign of his Form is to releaſe his mind from all other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Prayer, but only that of inward devotion, which is the life of Prayer, that ſo it may be the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to it: but if inſtead of applying his mind to this deſign, he ſuffers it to wander abroad, he makes an ill uſe of a good thing, and converts that which is in it ſelf a help to devotion, into an occaſion of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: But 'tis objected, that while his thoughts are imployed in inventing the matter and words of his Prayer, they are attending to the duty of Prayer, and while they are ſo they are well imploy'd, though they ſhould not be ſo attentively fixt upon the inward
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:390"/> devotion of Prayer, as they might be in the uſe of a Form: to which in ſhort I anſwer, That to invent the matter and words of Prayer, is not to pray, but to ſtudy a Prayer; and till our Brethren have proved, that our inventing the matter and words, is a part of our duty of Prayer, which is the Queſtion in debate between us, we can by no means grant, that our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it is attending to the duty of Prayer; we believe that when we pray devoutly by a Form, we diſcharge the whole duty of Prayer, though we do not invent the matter and words our ſelves, and when we ſee the contrary proved, we will not only yield that to attend to inventing, is to attend to the duty of Prayer; but that it is unlawful to pray by a Form: but in the mean time we can yield neither one, nor t'other. Seeing then that Forms are in themſelves more apt to fix the Miniſters attention to the inward acts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeeing that 'tis by attending to theſe acts, or at leaſt by ſeeming to do ſo, that he influences the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the people, it neceſſarily follows, that in this reſpect Forms are more advantageous to publick devotion, than conceiv'd or extemporary Prayer. But then,</p>
                           <p>2. It is pretended that conceiv'd Prayer is in it ſelf more apt to fix the Miniſters attention in Prayer than Forms, becauſe in conceiv'd Prayer he utters his words immediately from his affections, by reaſon of which his thoughts have not that ſcope to wander, as when he reads them out of a Book: to which, in ſhort, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if he hath devout affections, he may utter his words as immediately from his affections in a Form, as in a conceiv'd Prayer; and therefore this pretence is altogether inſignificant; for his own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as much a <hi>medium</hi> between his affections and utterance in Praying extempore, as the Book in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:391"/> by a Form; as for inſtance, ſuppoſe that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ſin, he be affected with ſhame and ſorrow, he cannot expreſs it in words, but by uſing his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or a Form, and whether he uſes one or t'other, he uſes a <hi>medium</hi> to expreſs it; and why thoſe words which he reads ſhould not be as immediate to his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as thoſe which he invents, provided they do as fully expreſs them, I am not able to apprehend; in ſhort therefore, if he hath devout affections, they will at leaſt as much confine his thoughts from wandering when he prays by Form, as when he prays Extempore, if he hath not, he cannot utter his words from his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, either in the one or t'other.</p>
                           <p>2. We will inquire whether thoſe advantages which our Brethren aſcribe to conceiv'd Prayer above Forms, as to the raiſing the Miniſters intention in Prayer, be real, or no: firſt they pretend that in reading a Form, his affections follow his words, and are raiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them: whereas in praying extempore, his words follow his affections. This I confeſs is a very curious diſtinction, but I am not able to apprehend either what foundation there is for it, or how it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the matter; for firſt what neceſſity is there either that his affections ſhould follow his words in a Form, more than in a conceiv'd Prayer, or that his words ſhould follow his affections in a conceiv'd Prayer, more than in a Form? why may not a man be devoutly affected with the matter he prays for, before he expreſſes it in a Form of words, as well as before he expreſſes it extempore? ſince if he be acquainted with the Form, he cannot but know before-hand what he is to pray for in it; and therefore if he be truly devout, cannot but be affected with it, before he prays for it; and ſo on the other hand, why may not a man as well be unaffected with the matter he prays for in conceiv'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:391"/> Prayer, till he hath expreſt it, as with the matter he prays for in a Form? or what reaſon can be aſſign'd, why the affection may not follow the words, and be excited by them in the one, as well as in the other? may not a man pray inconſiderately, and ſuffer his tongue, to run before his heart in both? and may not his affections which were before aſleep, be awakened by the ſound of his words in either? In ſhort therefore, ſince in praying by a Form, a man may know as well at leaſt, and hath as much time to conſider the matter he is to pray for before-hand, as in praying extempore; what reaſon is there why it ſhould be more difficult for him to affect his ſoul before-hand with it in the one, than in the other? and if it be equally hard and eaſie in both, than 'tis equally poſſible for his affections to go before, or follow his words in either. But then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſuppoſe it were true, that in conceiv'd Prayer the words follow the affections, and in a Form the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the words, how doth it from hence follow, that conceiv'd Prayer doth more intend and heighten the affections, than Forms? what reaſon can there be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, why thoſe acts of inward affections, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our words in Prayer, ſhould not be as intenſe and vigorous as thoſe which go before them? why may not a man exert as flagrant an act of deſire, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he hath expreſt his Petition, as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, eſpecially if that be true which our Brethren affirm, and which moſt men find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; that the words of Prayer, if they are proper and expreſſive, do naturally quicken and excite the affections; ſo that if it be the matter only that excites the affections, they may be as vehemently excited after the words are ſpoken as before; if it be the words alſo, the afflections muſt be leſs vehemently excited excited before the words, than after: in ſhort therefore, when the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:392"/> Miniſter prays in publick, whether it be by Form, or extempore, he prays on, without making any long pauſes between one Petition and another, ſo that as ſoon as ever he hath conceiv'd the matter, he expreſſes it, and whether it be immediately before or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, or while he is expreſſing it, that he joyns his affection to it, there can be no reaſon aſſign'd, if it be the matter he joyns them to, why he ſhould more affect it now, than then, there being nothing in the order of before or after, to raiſe and excite his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and if ſo, his affections following his words, though it were neceſſary to his praying by a Form, can be no diſadvantage to his Devotion, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary an advantage to it, though it were neceſſary to his praying extempore: but then ſecondly, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Miniſter cannot ſo well expreſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout affections in other mens words, as in his own, and therefore when he prays in a Form of words of other mens compoſure, 'tis impoſſible his affections ſhould be ſo livelily repreſented, as when he prays extempore: To which in ſhort I anſwer, That the Miniſters buſineſs in publick Prayer is not to expreſs the degrees and heighths of his own affections, or to acquaint God of the particular and extraordinary fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencies of his own ſoul: for in publick he prays as the common mouth of the Congregation, and therefore he ought not to expreſs to God in the name of the People, any matter that is peculiar to himſelf, or to repreſent his own particular extraordinary fervours, as the common caſe of the Congregation, but his words ought to be ſuch as every honeſt and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Chriſtian may truly joyn with, as the ſenſe and meaning of his own ſoul; and for him to expreſs to God in the name of the People, ſuch heights of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as few or none of them are arrived to, is as bad as to confeſs in their names ſuch ſins to God, as few or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:392"/> none of them are guilty of. So that if the Miniſter hath ſuch peculiar heighths of affection as can be fitly expreſt only in his own words, he ought not to tell God of them in a publick Prayer, in which he is to expreſs nothing but what is the true and common ſenſe of every honeſt and ſincere Chriſtian; and this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may be as fitly expreſt in another mans words as in his own, unleſs we will ſuppoſe that no man can ſo well expreſs the common ſenſe of a Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as he that prays extempore, yea, and that he himſelf cannot ſo fitly expreſs it in premeditated words, as in extemporary ones; neither of which I ſuppoſe any ſober Diſſenter will affirm. But then Thirdly and laſtly, it is alſo pretended, that in the uſe of Forms, the Miniſters ſoul is ſo ingaged in directing his eye to read, that it cannot be ſo intenſly affected with what he prays for, as when he prays extempore; in anſwer to which, I leave the Reader to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the recollecting of the matter of Prayer, the diſpoſing of it into a due method, and inventing of proper phraſes to expreſs it, (neither of which are acts of Prayer, as I ſhew'd before) muſt not much more buſie and ingage the Miniſters foul when he is praying publickly, than the directing of his eye to read; that is, whether one that hath ſo perfect a habit of reading as that he can readily exerciſe it without imploying one thought about it, cannot read a Prayer more eaſily, than invent one? for ſo much eaſier as it is to read than to invent a Prayer, ſo much leſs his ſoul hath to divert it from being affected with what he prays for when he prays by a Form, than when he prays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore. And thus you ſee that thoſe advantages which are aſcribed to conceiv'd Prayer, as to the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Miniſters Devotion, are ſuch as are either imaginary, or as ought rather to be aſcribed to Forms.</p>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:393"/>
                           <p>But it is pretended, that Forms of Prayer do not only deaden the Miniſters Devotion, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Peoples, but that they do alſo deaden the Peoples by a more direct and immediate influence, becauſe they ſtill expreſs the matter of Prayer in the ſame words, which when the People have often heard, will be apt to cloy their attention, whereas the very newneſs and variety of words, in which conceiv'd Prayers are expreſt, doth naturally awaken and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their minds and keep them more fixt and intent. For anſwer whereunto, let us conſider upon what it is that this novelty and variety of expreſſion doth keep our minds ſo fixt and intent on; is it upon the matter of Prayer? doubtleſs, No; for that is generally the ſame, eſpecially the matter of publick Prayer, and therefore if it were that that fixt our minds, 'twould as well do it in the ſame as in new and varied expreſſions; and ſince the matter of publick Prayer is old, and for the main will be always ſo, why ſhould it not as well affect us in old words as in new, provided they expreſt it with equal propriety and fitneſs; but if it be meerly the nowneſs of the phraſe 'tis expreſs'd in, that fixes their minds: there is nothing in it but a meer ſurpriſe and amuſement of their fancies, which inſtead of fixing doth unfix their minds from the internal acts of Prayer, and divert its attention from the devotion to the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of it; ſo that this fixation of their minds on the novelty of the phraſe and method of Prayer, is ſo far from being an advantage, that 'tis a diſtraction to their devotion. As for Forms of Prayer, there is no doubt but they may be compoſed with the ſame advantage of expreſſion, and pronounced with the ſame affection as the Prayers of our own extempore compoſure, and if they are ſo, they will have the ſame advantage of the muſick of ſpeech to excite the Devotions of the People;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:393"/> but as for novelty of method and expreſſion, that may indeed entertain their minds and divert them from roving out to other objects, but even this entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a roving and excurſion of their minds from the acts of Prayer, which, while they are amuſed with the novelty of the phraſe and method of the Prayer, can be no more intent on the devotion of it, than while they are buſied about ſecular objects and affairs. And indeed that ſeeming devotion that is raiſed in the minds of the People by the gingling of the Miniſters words about their fancies, is generally falſe and counterfeit, for as words do naturally impreſs the fancy, ſo the fancy doth naturally excite the ſenſitive affections; ſo that when the affections are excited meerly by the art and muſick of the words of Prayer, it is not Devotion but Mechaniſm; for there is no doubt but men may be and many times are ſtrangely affected with the words of Prayer, when they have not the leaſt ſpark of true devotion to the matter of it; for when they fancy the matter of Prayer, and are affected with it meerly for the ſake of the words, the movement of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection will ceaſe as ſoon as the impreſſion is worn out which the words make upon their fancies, and if in the mean time they happen to hear any other matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the ſame affectionate words, they will in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be as much affected with it, as they are now with the matter of Prayer, but if the mind be truly devout and doth affect the matter of Prayer for it ſelf and not for the ſake of the words, I cannot imagin how new words ſhould any way advantage its devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs they were to expreſs new matter. Since therefore the matter of publick Prayer neither is nor ought to be new, unleſs it be upon extraordinary pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick emergencies, what colour of reaſon can there be aſſign'd, why the devotion of the hearers ſhould be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:394"/> more affected with it in new words than in old, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it be expreſs'd and pronounc'd with the ſame propriety and affection in both. And thus I have ſhewn that thoſe advantages of publick Devotion, which are pretended to be peculiar to conceiv'd Prayers, are for the moſt part imaginary, and that ſo far forth as they are real they are more peculiar to Forms of Prayer, I proceed to the third and laſt enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. Whether there are not ſundry advantages of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotion peculiar to Forms of Prayer, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayers cannot pretend to? That there are, I do affirm, and will indeavour to prove by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtances.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. One great advantage that is peculiar to publick Forms of Prayer, is, That the People may addreſs themſelves to them with greater preparation; for if they pleaſe, they may peruſe the words before-hand, and conſider the ſenſe and matter of them, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to affect their minds with it; as for inſtance, when I know before-hand what words my ſins will be confeſt in, when I am to joyn in the publick Devotions, I can conſider before-hand the ſenſe and meaning of them, and prepare ſuch affections as are ſutable to them; as ſuppoſe the confeſſion be that of our Church's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, wherein we begin with <hi>Almighty and moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father;</hi> I can conſider the meaning of theſe words before I come to Church; and from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of God's almighty and moſt merciful nature, excite my affections to an awful dread of his power, and an ingenuous ſenſe of his mercy; by which, when I come to joyn with theſe words in the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I ſhall be duely affected with the ſenſe of them, and my ſoul will be ready melted into all that filial ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and humiliation for my ſin, which the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I have offended by it an Almighty and moſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:394"/> merciful Father ſuggeſts; and ſo if I conſider, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply before-hand all the reſt of the confeſſion, I ſhall thereby tune and ſet my affections to the ſenſe and matter of each particular phraſe and expreſſion in it; which 'twill be impoſſible for me to do when I am to joyn with an extempore Prayer; becauſe I cannot know before-hand what the phraſes and expreſſions of it will be; beſides which, upon the words of publick Forms, there may be written excellent Paraphraſes and Meditations, ſuch as is that of the <hi>Companion to the Temple;</hi> by reading of which the Devotions of the People may be very much excited and improved; which is ſuch an advantage as the words of extempore Prayer will not admit of.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Another advantage peculiar to publick Forms, is, That in joining with them the People may pray with more underſtanding, than they can well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do in conceiv'd and extempore Prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in generally the Miniſter is forc'd to make uſe of ſuch words and expreſſions as come firſt to hand, having not leiſure enough to pick and chooſe his words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making long and undecent pauſes and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo that ſometimes he is fain to uſe a hard word, which perhaps not half the People underſtand, becauſe an eaſier doth not come to his mind, and ſometimes to intangle his expreſſions with long Parentheſes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to darken his matter with far fetch'd Metaphors, or to expreſs it by halfs in broken Sentences, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to run out his Periods to an inordinate length, by which the ſenſe of them is very much clouded and obſcur'd: theſe and ſuch like inconveniences all the World knows do very commonly attend extempore Effuſions: and let a mans fancy and tongue be never ſo fluent and voluble, he can never be ſo ſecure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf intelligibly to the People when he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:395"/> prayers extempore, as he might be if he took time enough before-hand to chooſe his words, and form his expreſſions, ſo that the People may be much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of underſtanding what they pray for when they joyn with a Form, than when they joyn with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Prayer; for to be ſure in compoſing publick Forms more care will be taken of the phraſe, that the words may fit the matter, and expreſs it intelligibly to the People, than there can be in extempore Prayer; which admits of no long conſideration, no alteration upon ſecond thoughts, no after-ſcanning or reviſal, as Forms of Prayer do, but it muſt paſs as it happens, whether it be intelligible or no, by reaſon of which thoſe who <hi>occupy the room of the unlearned,</hi> are many times forc'd to break off praying for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what the words and expreſſions of the Prayer mean; for whether the Prayer be ſpoken <hi>in an unknown Tongue,</hi> or in words that are unintelligible to the People, it is all one to them, for ſtill their <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is unfruitful,</hi> and ſo long their devotion muſt be broken and interrupted.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Another advantage peculiar to publick Forms, is, That the People may joyn with them with much more faith and aſſurance, than they can with extempore Prayers; it muſt doubtleſs be of great advantage to a mans devotion in publick, to be ſatisfied before-hand that the matter he is to pray for is good and acceptable to God; for by this means he will be inabled to pray on with a ſtronger ſaith and ſurer hope of being heard and accepted; but this a man can never be ſatisfied of aforehand, that joyns in extempore Prayer, unleſs he hath an implicit faith in his Miniſter, that he will ſay nothing to God but what is true, nor ask any thing of him but what is lawful; which how he can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly depend on, I cannot imagin, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:395"/> that the Miniſter who prays is many times a ſtranger to him, both as to his perſon and principles, and for all that he knows may be very erronious, raſh, and unadviſed, or very ignorant of what is matter of Prayer, and what not; And even thoſe Miniſters whom he knows, and can beſt confide in, are not always ſo very ſure of their hands, but that ſome times they may miſtake their paſſion for their zeal, and reak their anger or faction in their Prayers, or in the heat and hurry of ſpeaking what comes next, let drop an error before they are aware, or expreſs themſelves ſo doubtfully, or unadviſedly, that an honeſt and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind may not be able to joyn with him; ſo that in joyning with an extempore Prayer, it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, (as hath been obſerved by an excellent Divine upon this Argument) that as we go along with the Miniſter, we ſhould judge of what he ſaith before our hearts conſent to it, and if it ſhould ſo happen, that by reaſon of the novelty, or ambiguity, affectation, or indigeſtedneſs of his expreſſions, or any ſuch rub in our way, we cannot readily judge, but are fain to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate, and deliberate upon this, or that paſſage; in the mean time he who prays is gone on, and now upon a new ſubject, and we are left behind, and at a loſs, and perhaps miſerably confounded before our Devotion can cloſe in again, and no ſooner it may be, is it well fixt, but 'tis led away again into the ſame inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency and maze: all which may be eaſily prevented by the uſe of publick Forms; of the matter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of which, the People may eaſily ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aforehand, and when this is done, they will have nothing elſe to do, but to pray and keep their holy affections a going, they will have no new Judgment to make of what is ſaid, no doubtful phraſe or matter to examin, and their judgment being ſatisfied before
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:396"/> they begin to pray, with the words and matter of the Prayer, their devotion may go on with it, without pauſe or ſtop in an even and uninterrupted current.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Another advantage peculiar to publick Forms, is, That they have much leſs in them to divert the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the People from the matter of Prayer. For as for extempore Prayer, it is very apt to diſturb the devotion of the People, whether it be well or ill perform'd, if he who performs it heſitates, or blunders, or expreſſes himſelf in crude, undecent, or fantaſtick phraſes, inſtead of attending to the matter, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their affections with it, they will in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be pitying, or contemning him, carping at what comes next, and running deſcants on his weakneſs and impertinence; if he perform well, and his method be orderly and artificial, his matter good, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions fluent and apt, and eaſie, they will in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be admiring his parts, and entertaining their curioſity with the elegancy of his phraſe, the ſolidity and promptneſs of his judgment, and the art and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his compoſure; either of which muſt very much divert and call off their affections from the matter; whereas while they are joyning in publick Forms, to which they have been accuſtomed, and in which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtrength, nor weakneſs of the Miniſters parts appears, they have none of all theſe ſnares to intangle their devotion: for being uſed to the words, and phraſe, and method, they have no temptation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their minds any farther about them, than as they convey the matter of the Prayer to them, and having none of the above-named diverſions, to carry away their minds from the matter, they may doubtleſs, if they pleaſe, attend to it with much more fervour and affection.</p>
                           <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52190:396"/>
                           <p n="5">5. Another peculiar advantage to the Peoples Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in joyning with publick Forms, is, That they are more ſecur'd as to the decency and ſolemnity of their publick Worſhip; and I ſuppoſe there is no body will queſtion, but that the decent and ſolemn performance of publick Worſhip, is highly advantageous to the Devotion of the People. But now whilſt they joyn in extempore Prayers, the decency and ſolemnity of the performance, doth altogether depend upon the ability and preſent diſpoſedneſs of the Miniſter: So that if he happen to be a man of a mean elocution, of an unready memory, or an unfruitful invention, it is impoſſible the Office ſhould be perform'd with that decency and ſolemnity, that is neceſſary to affect the minds, and excite the devotions of the People; yea inſtead of that perhaps, the wretched dulneſs, the blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, confuſion, and impertinence of the performance, may turn their devotion into ſcorn and laughter; for of this I have ſeen too many ſad experiments: but ſuppoſe the Miniſter be a man of pregnant parts, and ready in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and elocution, yea and of great Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, yet 'tis poſſible he may be frequently liable to great indiſpoſitions of body, and mind, to dulneſs, and inadvertency, to wandering, and diſtraction of thoughts, to deficiencies of invention, and failures of memory, and incumbrances of mind, with outward cares and accidents; and if he be, what remedy is there, but that he muſt many times pray confuſedly, and omit a great deal of the matter of Prayer, and utter a great deal of it in broken or undecent expreſſions? and how can he avoid being ſometimes at a loſs, both for words and matter, and being forc'd to ſupply the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his invention, with fulſome repetitions of what went before? and how is it poſſible almoſt but that a great deal of flat and empty nonſenſe, a great many
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:397"/> crude and undigeſted conceptions, and raſh and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd expreſſions ſhould eſcape from his lips before he is aware? and this, if he hath any grain of modeſty in him, muſt, upon the leaſt reflection, put him into a greater confuſion, and ſo amaze, and bewilder him, that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Prayer perhaps, he will hardly be able to recover himſelf to any conſiſtency of thoughts: Now is it not a hard caſe, that the decency and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the publick Prayers of a Congregation, ſhould depend upon the uncertain and variable temper and diſpoſition of one ſingle perſon; ſo as that if he happen to be indiſpos'd or diſorder'd in his body or mind, the Devotions of 500 or 1000 perſons muſt partake of his diſorders and diſtractions; for how much ſoever he is indiſpoſed, their Prayer can be no better than what he is able to pour out extempore, and how flatly, unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly or confuſedly ſoever he prays, they muſt pray after him, or not pray at all; which vaſt inconvenience is wholly cur'd and prevented, by a well compos'd Form of Prayer, for how weak ſoever the Miniſters parts be, or how much ſoever he may be at preſent indiſpoſed, if he can but read diſtinctly and ſeriouſly, the Devotion of the People will not be at all affected or influenc'd by it; for whatſoever his parts, or preſent temper be, they will be ſure to find an orderly and methodical Prayer to joyn with; a Prayer that is comprehenſive of all their common caſes and neceſſities; that is ſober and good, mature and well adviſed as to the matter; that is full and plain and decent as to the phraſe and expreſſion of it; and in a word, that is every way ſuted to all the parts, and ends, and offices of publick Devotion; And if they pleaſe, they may ſatisfie themſelves before-hand, that there is nothing in the Prayer they are to joyn with, but what becomes publick Worſhip, which is the moſt ſerious and ſolemn thing in the World.</p>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52190:397"/>
                           <p n="6">6. Another peculiar advantage of publick Forms, is, That in joyning with them the People may be better ſecur'd of the reality and ſincerity of their own Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For in joyning with extempore Prayers, there is no doubt but they may, and many times do miſtake the tickling of their fancies, for true and ſincere Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for their fancies being ſurpriz'd, and amuſed, meerly by the novelty of the expreſſions, will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally influence their ſenſitive paſſions and chafe them into ſuch warmths as an undiſcerning judgment may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily miſtake for the holy fervours of Devotions; they find themſelves ſtrangely heated in the Prayer, and upon that immediately conclude, that they are wonderfully devout, without ever enquiring, whether it be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the phraſe and expreſſion that heats them; and ſo from thoſe tranſports of paſſion, which are meerly the effects of new and ſurpriſing words ſtriking briskly on their fancies, they many times take occaſion to flatter themſelves into a great opinion of their Piety and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; whereas many of theſe perſons are notoriouſly immoral in their lives, and utterly diſaffected to the matter they pray for with ſo much ſeeming earneſtneſs and affection; which is a plain argument, that their affection is not to the matter, but meerly to the words and expreſſions; and in all probability the ſame ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſingneſs of expreſſion would have as much effected them at a Play, as it doth at a Prayer: thus for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when they hear God or Chriſt ſpoken of, and their goodneſs and perfections preſented in a new and ſurpriſing ſtrain of expreſſions, their fancy many times is ſtrangely ſmitten with it, and this makes their ſpirits flow with a ſweet and placid torrent to their heart; and by their frisking about it, to ſooth and tickle it into great complacency and pleaſure; till at laſt it opens and dilates its orifices, and the grateful flood breaks in, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52190:398"/> drowns it in delight and raviſhment; and yet all this many times, inſtead of being a real complacency of their ſouls in God, is only a complacency of their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the phraſe by which he is deſcribed and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and had they heard the Hero of Play deſcrib'd in the ſame phraſe, they might probably have been moved to the ſame affection to him, as they are now to God and their Saviour; for the ſame kind of influence that new and ſurpriſing expreſſions have upon mens fancies in Prayer, they will have when applied to other matters; And if we will believe <hi>Plutarch,</hi> it was an ordinary thing with the <hi>Greek</hi> Sophiſts, by their honied words, ſurpriſing phraſes, ſinging tones, and effeminate accents, to excite their Auditors into a kind of Bacchical Enthuſiaſm; and no doubt but thoſe hearers, of whom he there ſpeaks, who were wont to applaud their Orators at the end of their Declamations with a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, divinely, heavenly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitably ſpoken; found themſelves as much moved, as many a man doth at an extempore Prayer; who yet verily believes, that it is not meerly a movement of his fancy, but of his ſincere and true devotion. This therefore is a great diſadvantage of extempore Prayer in publick, that meerly by amuſing the fancies of the people with the ſurpriſing novelty of its expreſſions, it puts them into fits of counterfeit devotion, and makes them many times imagin that they are heartily affected with the matter of the Prayers, when 'tis meerly the phraſe of it that by ſtriking on their fancies, moves their ſenſitive affection. But whether this movement of affection be fancy, or devotion, a man may much more eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh when he joyns with a Form, than when he joyns with an extempore Prayer; for he being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aforehand with the phraſes and expreſſions of the Form, it is not to be ſuppoſed, that they ſhould much
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52190:398"/> ſurpriſe and amuſe his fancy, and therefore if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, he finds himſelf heartily affected in the Prayer, he may much more ſecurely conclude, that it is the matter, and not meerly the words that moves and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects him. And thus, with all plainneſs and ſincerity, I have indeavoured to repreſent thoſe peculiar advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which Forms of Prayer have above extempore ones, as to the quickening and improving the Devotions of the People: I might have given other Inſtances of it, but theſe I think are ſufficient to determin the caſe in debate, and to convince any unprejudic'd man, that pious and well compoſed Forms, are ſo far from deaden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publick Devotions, that they contribute ſundry great advantages to it. And indeed if publick Forms do deaden the Peoples Devotion, it muſt be either as they always confine the Devotions of the People to the ſame ſet of words, which, as I have proved at large, is a great advantage to their Devotion; or as they do <hi>pro tempore</hi> confine them to a certain ſet of words; in which ſenſe the Miniſters extempore Prayer is a Form to the People, and doth as much confine their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a certain ſet of words, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> as any ſtated Form whatſoever.</p>
                           <p>And now, if after all this, it be objected by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they find by Experience, which is the beſt Argument, that Forms do actually deaden their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would beſeech them ſeriouſly to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this experience of theirs be not founded in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable prejudice; and if it be, whether it's fit that their unreaſonable prejudice ſhould preſcribe to the whole Church? it's certain, that there are other men as truly pious and devout as they, who find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that joyning with the publick Forms is a great advantage to their Devotion; ſo that here is experience againſt experience; and certainly where there are two
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52190:399"/> contrary experiences of the ſame thing, they cannot both proceed from the nature of the thing; but one, or t'other muſt neceſſarily ariſe from the diſpoſition and temper of thoſe who are converſant about it: Now I have ſhew'd that Forms of Prayer are in themſelves real advantages to publick Devotion, and that they are ſo, there are many thouſands of good Chriſtians can atteſt by their own experience; and therefore if our Brethren do not experience the ſame, the fault muſt lie in their own prejudice, or temper, and there is no doubt to be made, but would they heartily indeavour to cure their own prejudice, and to diſpoſſeſs their minds of thoſe groundleſs Piques they have entertain'd againſt our Liturgy; would they but peruſe it with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial eyes; conſider the contents, and labour to affect their minds with the ſenſe and matter of it; they would quickly find the ſame experience of its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſneſs to publick devotion, as thoſe bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs did who compos'd it, us'd, and at laſt died for it, and valued every Leaf of it as an ineſtimable treaſure; and as we ſhould conſent in our experience, ſo we ſhould alſo in our communion, and with one heart and one mouth glorifie our Father together.</p>

                           <head>CASE IV. <hi>Whether the common Caſes and Wants of Chriſtians can be ſo well expreſs'd in one Conſtant Form, as in a Conceiv'd Prayer?</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>IT is objected, That not onely the Caſes of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians, but the common Caſes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Societies and Aſſemblies are ſubject to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Changes and Alterations; that they have many times new Judgments to be humbled for, new Bleſſings to return thanks for, new Dangers to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and new Hopes to purſue and ſollicit, which the Compoſers of our ſtanding Forms could not foreſee, and for which by conſequence they could not provide ſutable Petitions and Thankſgivings; beſides which, particular Churches may at one time be more pure and reform'd, and at another time more deprav'd and degenerated; and certainly ſuch different ſtates require different Confeſſions and Prayers: and therefore to ſute and adapt one common Form to common Caſes and Neceſſities, which are ſo very variable and alterable, ſeems as vain an attempt, as 'twould be to make a Coat to fit the Moon in all its changes; whereas were the publick Prayers left to be conceived and worded by the Miniſters, ſufficient proviſion might be made for all theſe alterations and changes, by their varying their Confeſſions, Petitions, and Thankſgivings, according as the common Caſes and Exigencies of their People vary: and therefore ſince conceiv'd Prayers are moſt fit to repreſent the publick Caſes and Neceſſities, they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:401"/> think it very unlawful that the publick Prayers ſhould be perform'd by a Form. In order to the full and plain reſolution of this Caſe therefore I ſhall lay down theſe following Propoſitions:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That the common Caſes and Neceſſities of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are for the main always the ſame, and therefore may be more fully comprehended in a Form, than in an extempore Prayer: for publick Prayers ought not to deſcend to particular Caſes and Neceſſities, becauſe they are the Prayers of the whole Congregation, and therefore ought to comprehend no more than what is more or leſs every man's Caſe and Neceſſity: They ought to confeſs ſin in no other particular inſtances or aggravations, than ſuch as are juſtly chargeable upon a Congregation of Chriſtians; nor to petition or return thanks for any other Mercies, but what a Chriſtian Congregation may be ſuppoſed either to ſtand in need of, or to have receiv'd; becauſe the Confeſſion, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Thankſgiving is in the name of the whole Congregation, and therefore ought to comprize no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them but what is the common Caſe of all, and what every one may truly and ſincerely joyn with. Now as for theſe matters of Prayer which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Chriſtian Congregations, they are for the main always the ſame; the ſame ſins and aggravations of ſin which were fit for a common Confeſſion of Chriſtians one thouſand years ago, are for the main as fit for our common Confeſſions to this day; and the Mercies which we need and receive in common now, are for the main the ſame with what all Chriſtians before us have needed and receiv'd in common. As for inſtance, the Mercies which in publick Prayer ought to be petition'd for, are ſuch as all Chriſtians have a common need of, and ought to have a common concern for; ſuch as the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:401"/> forgiveneſs of our ſins, the peace of our Conſciences, the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace to deliver us from the power of ſin and Satan, and make us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from Death and Hell, protection and ſucceſs in all our honeſt Concerns and Undertakings, and the dayly ſupply of our bodily Wants and Neceſſities; and in general, the preſervation and direction of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, the peace and welfare of our native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the proſperity of the Church, the propagation of the Goſpel, and the ſucceſs of its Miniſters in the work of the Lord. And theſe were the main matter of the common Petitions of Chriſtian people a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago, and will be ſo a thouſand years hence. Since therefore the matter of publick Prayer is for the main always the ſame, I can ſee no reaſon why, ſo far as it is the ſame, it may not be more comprehenſively expreſs'd in a Form, than in an extempore Prayer; which depending on the preſent invention and memory of the ſpeaker, it is impoſſible almoſt, but of ſo many particulars, ſome ſhould be many times omitted, or at leaſt not ſo fully and diſtinctly expreſs'd, as it might be in a well-conſider'd Form; the Compoſer of which hath much more time to recollect the matter, and may ſupply whatſoever was omitted at firſt, upon a ſecond or a third reviſal: and I dare appeal to any impartial Judge, whether in our Churches Litany, how meanly ſoever our Brethren may think of it, there be not a much more diſtinct enumeration of the main particulars of publick Petitions, than ever he met with in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Prayer.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That ſuch alterations of the common Caſes and Neceſſities of Chriſtian Churches as could not be for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen and provided for at the firſt forming of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, may for the moſt part be provided for in new
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:402"/> Forms, when they happen; for ſo our Church, we ſee, hath done in all ſuch new Caſes as are of a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and general concern: though the Compoſers of our Liturgy could not foreſee the Horrid Powder-Plot, and the ſtrange diſcovery of it, the impious Murder of the late King, and the happy Reſtoration of this, yet upon the happening of thoſe great Events, our Church hath always taken care to provide ſuch Forms of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer as are every way ſuitable to the Caſe: and as for thoſe extraordinary Caſes which might be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, becauſe they happen more frequently in the courſe of things, ſuch as want of Rain, or fair Weather, Dearth and War, Plague and Sickneſs, there may be Forms compoſed for them afore-hand, as there are in our Church's Liturgy; ſo that it is no Argument at all againſt publick Forms, that they cannot make a due proviſion for extraordinary Caſes and Events: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they happen, extempore Prayers can no more make due proviſion for them than Forms; and after they happen, as due a proviſion may be made for them by Forms as by extempore Prayers.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That ſuppoſing ſuch proviſion for extraordinary Caſes be not or cannot be made in the publick Form, yet that is no Argument why it ſhould not be uſed ſo far forth as it comprehends the main of the common Caſes and Neceſſities of the People: for, as I ſhew'd before, the main matter of publick Prayer may be much more fully comprehended in a ſtudied Form, than it can reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be in an extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Prayer; in which, in all probability, there will be more omiſſions, as to what reſpects the ordinary caſes of Chriſtians, than there are in the publick Form, as to what reſpects their extraordinary caſes: ſo that if the Form ought not to be uſed, becauſe it extends not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to all their extraordinary Caſes, for the ſame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:402"/> reaſon extempore Prayer ought not to be uſed, becauſe it extends not always to all their ordinary Caſes. But ſince, as hath been proved at large, the uſe of Forms is upon ſundry accounts of great advantage to the publick Devotion, it's very reaſonable that they ſhould be uſed ſo far forth as they can and do expreſs the common Caſes and Neceſſities; and that the people ſhould not be deprived of the benefit of joyning with them in the main matters of publick Prayer, becauſe ſuch extraordinary matters may occur as either are not or can be expreſs'd in them; eſpecially when</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The defect of ſuch new proviſion, for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caſes, may be ſupplied by the Miniſter in a publick Prayer of his own: for, as I obſerved before, our Church allows, or at leaſts permits the Miniſter to uſe a Prayer of his own compoſure in the Pulpit; in which, if any extraordinary Mercy or Judgment, for which there is no proviſion in our Liturgie, happen to the place he lives in, there is no doubt but he may and ought to ſupply the Devotion of his People with ſuch Confeſſions, Petitions, and Thankſgivings, as are proper and ſuitable to the occaſion: and where this is allow'd of or permitted, the non-proviſion for ſuch extraordinary Caſes in the eſtabliſht Liturgy can be no bar at all againſt the uſe of it, provided its Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be good, and comprehend all ordinary matters of Prayer; it is ſufficiently provided for ordinary publick Devotion, and ſo far doubtleſs may be lawfully uſed, ſufficient proviſion being otherwiſe made for all thoſe extraordinary matters which it doth not or could not comprehend. The ſum of all therefore is this, That as for the ordinary and main matters of publick Prayer, they may be more fully and diſtinctly comprehended in a Form, than in an extempore Prayer; and as for thoſe new matters which extraordinary publick Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:403"/> do adminiſter, they may for the generality be as well comprehended in a new Form, as in a new extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Prayer; and though it ſhould not or could not be expreſs'd in the publick Form, yet that is no bar againſt our joyning with it in all other matters of Prayer, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when theſe new matters of Prayer may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and expreſs'd in a publick Prayer of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's own compoſure.</p>

                           <p>IN which Caſe there are two Enquiries to be made: 1. Whether there be any Warrant for Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the holy Scripture? 2.

                           <p>1. Whether there be any Warrant for the uſe of Forms of Prayer in holy Scripture? Where by Warrant muſt be meant either, firſt, poſitive Command; or ſecondly, allow'd Example; for upon both theſe our Brethren in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: Firſt, they require us to produce ſome poſitive Command, upon this pretence, that nothing ought to be uſed in the Worſhip of God, but what is commanded by him; which, how true it is, is not my preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enquire, that being done already to excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in the <hi>Caſe about Indifferent Things.</hi> But becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this pretence our Brethren reject the uſe of Forms as unlawful, I ſhall endeavour to prove theſe two things:</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. That ſuppoſing this pretence were true, yet it doth not conclude againſt the uſe of Forms.</item>
                              <item>2. That ſuppoſing it did conclude againſt the uſe of Forms, it equally concludes againſt conceiv'd or extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Prayer.</item>

                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:403"/>
                           <p>1. That ſuppoſing this pretence were true, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is not commanded by God, ought not to be uſed in his Worſhip, yet it doth not conclude againſt the uſe of Forms: for though we do not pretend that God hath any-where commanded us to pray to him by Forms and no otherwiſe, or that all the Prayers which we at any time offer to him, ſhould be firſt compoſed into a Form; yet we do aſſert, that he hath injoyn'd ſome Forms to be uſed and offer'd up in Prayer, though toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoſe particular Forms we grant there might be, and doubtleſs ſometimes were other Prayers to be offer'd up to him. Thus in the Old Teſtament we read of ſundry Forms of Prayer injoyn'd to be uſed by God himſelf, and which is the ſame thing, by perſons imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſpired; ſo <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>On this wiſe, or thus, ſhall</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons bleſs the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying unto them, The Lord bleſs thee and keep thee, the Lord make his face ſhine upon thee, the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</hi> In which words the Prieſt did ſolemnly invocate and pray for a Bleſſing on the people, and he is commanded to do it, ſaying unto them this very Form of words, <hi>The Lord bleſs thee,</hi> &amp;c. which is as plain an injunction of this Form, as words can well expreſs. So alſo in the expiation of uncertain Murder, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 7, 8. the people are injoyn'd by God to ſay, <hi>Be merciful, O Lord, unto thy people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whom thou haſt redeem'd, and lay not innocent bloud unto thy people of</hi> Iſrael<hi>'s charge.</hi> So alſo at their paying their third years Tythes, they were expreſly injoyn'd to uſe this Form of words, <hi>I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Look down from thy holy habitation from heaven, and bleſs thy people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the land which thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us, as thou ſwareſt unto our fathers, the land that flows with milk and honey.</hi> And as God injoyn'd them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:404"/> theſe and ſuch-like Forms for particular occaſions, ſo <hi>David,</hi> by inſpiration from God, appointed them the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> for their Publick Service: for ſo in the Titles we find ſeveral of them particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Choires of the Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> for parts of their Vocal Service, ſome to the Sons of <hi>Korah,</hi> others to <hi>Aſaph,</hi> others to <hi>Jeduthun,</hi> and a great many to the Maſter of the Muſick. And though others have no title at all, as particularly the 96th and 105th, yet 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 7. we find that they <hi>were deliver'd by</hi> David <hi>into the hands of</hi> Aſaph <hi>and his brethren,</hi> for Forms of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to God; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 30. we are told that <hi>Hezekiah the King commanded the</hi> Levites <hi>to ſing praiſe unto the Lord, with the words of</hi> David <hi>and of</hi> Aſaph <hi>the ſeer.</hi> And this Liturgy was renew'd by <hi>Ezra,</hi> at the laying the Foundations of the ſecond Temple; for ſo, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 10, 11. the Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> were order'd to praiſe the Lord <hi>after the Ordinance of</hi> David <hi>King of</hi> Iſrael, and accordingly <hi>they ſung together by courſe, in praiſing and giving thanks unto the Lord, becauſe he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards</hi> Iſrael. And beſides all theſe inſtances of Forms of Prayer appointed by God in the Old Teſtament, we have a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable one in the New, and that is the Lord's Prayer, which in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. our Saviour thus preſcribes, <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. in which he doth as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly injoyn them the uſing of that Form of words as was poſſible for him to do in any humane Language: for if he had ſaid, <hi>When ye pray, ſay or uſe this Form of words,</hi> it could not have been more expreſſive of his intention to impoſe it as a Form, than his bidding them, when they pray'd, to <hi>ſay, Our Father:</hi> And if we will not admit that to be the ſence of a Text, which the words of it do as plainly ſignifie as they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:404"/> could have done if it were, we have no way to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſence of any Scripture, but may eternally play upon the plaineſt words of it with quirks of wit and fancy. But it is objected by our Brethren, That in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 9. where our Saviour alſo delivers this Prayer to the Diſciples, inſtead of bidding them <hi>ſay Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he onely bids them pray after this manner, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. which is a plain argument, ſay they, that he gave it to them not as a Form, but as a Pattern and Directory of Prayer. To which I anſwer, 1. That where the ſame matter is mention'd ambiguouſly in one Text, and plainly and expreſly in another, it's a neceſſary rule of interpretation, that the ſence of the doubtful and ambiguous Text ſhould be determin'd by the words of the plain and expreſs Text. Now it's plain, that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>pray thus,</hi> is of a doubtful ſignification, and may as well denote, Pray in theſe words, as after this Pattern and Direction; and he who is bid to pray thus, obeys the command, whether he prays for the ſame things in others, or in the ſame words; ſo that had our Saviour expreſs'd himſelf in no other words but theſe, it might have been doubtful whether he meant to preſcribe it as a Form, or as a Directory of Prayer: but <hi>ſay Our Father,</hi> is plainly and expreſly, ſay theſe words, <hi>Our Father;</hi> and he who is bid to ſay ſuch words, diſobeys the command, though he ſhould ſay the ſame thing in other words: ſo that had our Saviour expreſs'd himſelf in no other words but theſe, there could have been no doubt but that his meaning was to preſcribe thoſe words for a Form of Prayer; unleſs we could have ſuppoſed, that by this Injunction, <hi>ſay Our Father,</hi> we are not oblig'd to <hi>ſay Our Father;</hi> and how could we have ſuppoſed that, without high preſumption, had it not been for this pretence of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>pray thus?</hi> Since therefore

                              <hi>pray thus</hi> is a doubtful expreſſion, it is very reaſonable it ſhould be interpreted by <hi>ſay Our Father,</hi> which is a plain and determinate one; and if ſo, the ſenſe of both muſt be this, <hi>When ye pray, uſe this Form of words,</hi> which I here preſcribe you, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>2ly.</hi> I anſwer, that our Saviour gave not this Prayer to his Diſciples after the manner of a Directory, but after the manner of a Form of Prayer: had he given it to them meerly as a direction what they were to pray for, in all probability he would have expreſt himſelf after another manner, and inſtead of bidding them <hi>ſay Our Father,</hi> or pray thus, <hi>Our Father,</hi> he would have bid them call upon God by the Name of their heavenly Father, and beſeech him to cauſe his Name to be glorified and hallowed in the World, and his Kingdom to ſpread and advance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſtead of which, he gives them a form'd Prayer, and bids them <hi>ſay</hi> it: And therefore ſince he gave it to them after the manner of a Form, and not after the manner of a Directory, and ſince we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that he intended they ſhould uſe it after the ſame manner in which he gave it, it follows, that he gave it to them to be uſed as a Form, and not meerly as a Pattern, or Directory. 3<hi>ly.</hi> I anſwer, That ſuppoſing that when he bid them pray thus, in the ſixth of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> he preſcrib'd it onely as a Directory for Prayer, yet it doth not follow but that when he bad them <hi>ſay Our Father,</hi> in the 11th of <hi>Luke,</hi> he might preſcribe it as a Form, becauſe it is not the ſame preſcription in both, but different, and given them at a different time, and upon a different occaſion: the firſt was given them in the Sermon upon the Mount, and in the ſecond year after his Baptiſm; the ſecond was given them upon their own requeſt, after he had done praying, and in the third year after his Baptiſm: and whoſoever ſhall conſult both places,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:405"/> will ſoon be convinc'd that the Lords Prayer in St. <hi>Luke</hi> was delivered at another time, and upon a quite different occaſion from that in St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> It's highly probable therefore that the Diſciples, when 'twas deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> lookt upon it meerly as given 'em by way of a Directory or Copy by which they were to frame and compoſe their Prayers: for if they had thought it given 'em as a Form of Prayer, it is not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable why they ſhould requeſt him to teach 'em a Form to pray by again, when he had taught 'em one before: either therefore their requeſt in St. <hi>Luke</hi> muſt be very impertinent, or it muſt be to deſire him to teach 'em ſomething more than they apprehended he had taught 'em in St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> but they knew that in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> he had taught 'em already how, and in what manner to pray; and therefore what further could they now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of him in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> but that he would teach 'em a Form of Prayer? Suppoſing then that St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s words were intended by our Saviour meerly for a Directory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his Diſciples apprehended, yet it doth not follow that St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s were ſo intended too, becauſe it was not onely given at a different time, and upon a different occaſion, but the occaſion was their requeſting our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to teach 'em ſomething more than what he had taught 'em in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that is, ſomething more than a meer Pattern or Directory for Prayer; and what elſe could that ſomething more be but a Form? Eſpecially conſidering, <hi>4ly.</hi> That the occaſion of Chriſts giving 'em this Prayer in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> was their requeſting him to <hi>teach 'em to pray as</hi> John <hi>taught his Diſciples:</hi> for it was the cuſtom of the Jewiſh Doctors, as our Learned <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath proved, to teach their Diſciples a Form of Prayer as the Badge and Livery of their Diſcipleſhip; according to which cuſtom it ſeems, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt had taught his Diſciples a Form of his own compoſure;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:406"/> which the Diſciples of Jeſus underſtanding, they make it their requeſt to him, that he, according to this lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtom, would teach them to pray alſo, that is, teach 'em a Form of Prayer even as <hi>John</hi> had taught his Diſciples: And that it was a Form, and not meerly a Directory of Prayer which they requeſted, is evident not onely from this cuſtom of the Jewiſh Doctors, but alſo from the reaſon of the thing: for how can we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imagine that either <hi>John</hi> or our Saviours Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould be ignorant how to pray, ſince as they were Jews, they had their ſet hours of dayly Prayer which they conſtantly obſerved? <hi>viz.</hi> the third, the ſixth, and the ninth, beſides which, as I obſerv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Diſciples of our Saviour had already received a Directory of Prayer from him; ſo that without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, that which they now requeſt of him was not a Directory but a Form: When therefore upon this their requeſt he bid 'em <hi>ſay, Our Father,</hi> they had all the reaſon in the World to believe that he preſcribed it as a Form; and unleſs he preſcrib'd it as a Form, he did not anſwer their requeſt even when he pretended to anſwer it.</p>
                           <p>But it is further objected by our Brethren, That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our Saviour did preſcribe it as a Form of Prayer to his Diſciples, yet it was onely <hi>pro tempore,</hi> till ſuch time as they were more fully inſtructed and inabled to pray by the coming of the holy Ghoſt. To inforce which, they obſerve, that this Prayer was not directed by Chriſt to be offered up in his Name, as all their Prayers were to be after his Aſcenſion into Heaven: for though <hi>hitherto,</hi> that is, while Chriſt was upon Earth, his Diſciples <hi>had asked nothing in his Name,</hi> John 16. 44. yet he enjoyns 'em after his Aſcenſion to ask in his Name, <hi>John</hi> 14. 13, 14. <hi>John</hi> 16. 23. which is a plain token, ſay they, that if he did preſcribe 'em this Prayer as a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:406"/> Form, he intended it ſhould be of no longer uſe than till after his Aſcention; otherwiſe he would have inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it his own Name, in which from thence to the end of the World all Chriſtian Prayers were to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up: and accordingly, ſay they, in all the New Teſtament we have not the leaſt intimation of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples uſing this Form.</p>
                           <p>In anſwer to which Objection, I ſhall endeavour to make out theſe three things: 1. That our Saviour hath not given us the leaſt intimation, that he preſcrib'd this Form <hi>pro tempore</hi> onely, or for a certain time. 2. That his not inſerting his own Name into it, is no argument at all that he ſo meant or intended. 3. That though there be no mention in the New Teſtament of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Diſciples uſing it, yet this is no argument ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they did not uſe it, or believe themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to uſe it.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That our Saviour hath not given us the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that he preſcribed this Form <hi>pro tempore</hi> onely, and not for continual uſe; nor indeed do thoſe who object it, produce the leaſt ſhadow of any ſuch intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and I would beſeech my Brethren to conſider of what dangerous conſequence it may be for them to pronounce Chriſt's Inſtitutions null, and extinguiſh the Obligations of them, without producing his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it: for, at the ſame rate, they may make void all the Inſtitutions of our Saviour, and pronounce even Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper temporary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, as well as the Lord's Prayer. Whatſoever Chriſt hath inſtituted without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of time, doth always oblige, though the perpetuity of the Obligation be not expreſs'd by him: and therefore unleſs the Objectors can prove that Chriſt hath limited the uſe of the Lord's Prayer to ſuch or ſuch a time, <hi>ſay Our Father</hi> muſt as much
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:407"/> oblige now, as it did when it was firſt deliver'd. But perhaps it may be ſaid, that though Chriſt hath not in expreſs words limited the uſe of this Form to ſuch a time, yet ſince his own Name, wherein all Prayers were to be offer'd up after his aſcention, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into it, this is a fair intimation, that he never intended it ſhould be uſed after his aſcention. I anſwer therefore,</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That his not inſerting his own Name into it, is no argument at all that he never intended it ſhould be uſed after his aſcention: we do acknowledge, that after he was aſcended and ſate down at the right hand of his Father, all his followers were obliged to offer up their Prayers in his Name or Mediation; but withal we do affirm, that they may offer up their Prayers in his Name, though they do not name him: for thus we have ſeveral Prayers of Chriſt's Diſciples recorded in the New Teſtament, which, without doubt, were offer'd in his Name, and yet his Name is not inſerted in them, at leaſt not as implying his mediation, as particularly <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 24. for indeed to pray in the Name of Chriſt, is to pray in his mediation, and to hope and depend upon his ſacrifice and interceſſion for a gracious anſwer of our Prayers: and if we expect all good through Jeſus, and wholly rely upon his merit for the acceptance of our Prayers, we pray in his Name though we do not name him; ſo that Chriſt's not inſerting his Name into this Prayer of his, doth not at all hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from offering it up in his mediation. 'Tis true, could it be made appear, that he did not intend we ſhould offer this Prayer in his Name, it would thence follow, that he did not intend we ſhould uſe it after his aſcention; but his not inſerting his Name into it, is no argument at all that he did not intend we ſhould offer it in his Name, ſince we may as well and truly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:407"/> offer it in his Name, though he is not named in it, as if he were; and he hath not given us the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will to the contrary: 'tis true, he did not expreſs his Name in it, becauſe as yet they to whom he gave it, were not to ask in his Name, he being not yet aſcended; but now that he is aſcended, we can as well offer it in his Name, as if his Name had been expreſs'd in it: how then doth it follow, that becauſe he did not direct them to offer it in his Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before his aſcention, therefore he did not intend they ſhould offer it in his Name afterwards? eſpecially conſidering that he himſelf had ſo fram'd it, that after his aſcention, when the Doctrine of his Mediation was to be more fully explain'd to them, they could not offer it at all but in and through his mediation: for now that we underſtand his mediation, we know that we are the Sons of God, in and through him; and therefore when we thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> we muſt implicitly invoke him in and through Jeſus Chriſt, through whom alone we acknowledge it is that God is peculiarly our Father. Since therefore our Saviour hath ſo compoſed this Form, as that after his aſcention his Followers could offer it up no otherwiſe, but in and through his mediation, this is a plain indication, that he intended that after his aſcention they ſhould offer it in his mediation, though his Name be not expreſt in it; and what though it be not expreſt? yet it may be expreſt, and always hath been in the Prayers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding it: for though we do believe that our Saviour hath commanded us to uſe this Form, at leaſt in our publick Worſhip, yet we do not pretend that no other Prayer is to be uſed beſides, either in publick or in private; and if we uſe another Prayer before it, we may expreſs in the tranſition to it, as we ordinarily do, that 'tis in the Name and Mediation of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:408"/> Jeſus Chriſt that we pray, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we ſay <hi>Our Father,</hi> we do implicitly pray in Chriſt's mediation, and alſo explicitly in the Prayers annext to it, how doth it follow, that becauſe Chriſt's Name is not expreſs'd in it, therefore he did not intend we ſhould offer it in his mediation, or therefore he did not intend it for a ſtanding Form?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That though there be no mention in the New Teſtament of the Apoſtles and Diſciples uſing it, yet this is no argument either that they did not uſe it, or that they did not believe themſelves oblig'd to uſe it: for the great deſigne of the New Teſtament being to give an account of the Life of Jeſus, and of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Precepts of his Religion, together with thoſe miraculous Works by which it was confirm'd, it can no more be expected that the Prayers of the Chriſtian Aſſemblies ſhould be recorded in it, than that the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be recited in the <hi>Expoſition of the Creed,</hi> or <hi>the whole Duty of Man.</hi> And therefore as the New Teſtament takes no notice of their uſing the Lord's Prayer, ſo neither doth it take notice of any other particular Prayer that they uſed in their publick Aſſemblies: from whence we may as reaſonably conclude, that they uſed no Prayer at all, notwithſtanding our Lord commanded them to pray, as that they did not uſe the Lord's Prayer, notwithſtanding he commanded them to <hi>ſay, Our Father;</hi> or at leaſt that they did not <hi>Baptize in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> ſince notwithſtanding Chriſt commanded them to do ſo, yet there is no record in the New Teſtament of their baptizing any perſons in that Form. So that from the ſilence of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter, it would be very unreaſonable to infer, that the Apoſtles omitted the Lords Prayer,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:408"/> notwithſtanding he once commanded them to uſe it; eſpecially conſidering that thoſe who lived neareſt the Apoſtolical Ages, and ſo were the moſt competent Judges of what was done in them, where the Scripture is ſilent, did always uſe this Form in their publick Prayers, and believe themſelves obliged to do ſo: For thus in the Apoſtolick Age <hi>Lucian</hi> makes mention of a Prayer which they uſed in their publick Worſhip, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

That Chriſt hath inſtituted a new Form of Prayer for his new Diſciples. St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was but a ſmall matter his Junior, reckons his giving a Form of Prayer among thoſe divine and wholeſome Precepts which he impoſed on his People: and a little after, <hi>Oremus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Fratres dilectiſſimi, ſicut Magiſter docuit, &amp;c.

                              <hi>did always at the Conſecration of the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>make uſe of the Lords Prayer.</hi> By theſe and ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teſtimonies which are quoted by learned men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this argument, it's evident that the Church of Chriſt in all Ages look'd upon the Lords Prayer as a ſtanding Form given by our Saviour, to be perpetually uſed by Chriſtians: and to be ſure, they who believed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it to be perpetually obliging, could not make the leaſt doubt, but that it was conſtantly uſed in the Apoſtolick Age. And my thinks 'tis very ſtrange, that had the inſtitution been temporary, the Church of Chriſt for fifteen hundred years ſhould never be wiſe enough to diſcover it; and it ſeems to me a very high preſumption for us to determine againſt the conſtant belief and practice of the Church in all Ages, without the leaſt warrant ſo to do, either from our Saviour or his Apoſtles.</p>
                           <p>By all this therefore it's abundantly evident, that both in the Old and New Teſtament there have been Forms of Prayer inſtituted and appointed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:409"/> ſo that were that true which our Brethren affirm, that nothing ought to be admitted into the Worſhip of God which he hath not commanded, yet this will not conclude againſt the admiſſion of Forms of Prayer, ſince there are Forms which God himſelf hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                           <p>But they object yet farther, <hi>That all that this proves is, that Forms of Prayer of Gods appointment may and ought to be admitted into his Worſhip; which no body doubts of: but from hence it doth by no means follow, that men may appoint Forms of humane compoſure: for thoſe Forms of Prayer which God preſcribed were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dictated by him to thoſe inſpired perſons who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered 'em; and therefore we may as well pretend to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point new Scripture for publick inſtruction, becauſe thoſe inſpired perſons did ſo, as to appoint new Forms for publick Worſhip.</hi> Now becauſe I perceive this Objection is very much inſiſted on by our Brethren, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to return a full and clear anſwer to it, in theſe following Propoſitions: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this Objection al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the preſcribing of Forms of Prayer to be lawful in its own nature. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it muſt allow the preſcribing of publick Forms to be not onely lawful, but good and uſeful. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It muſt alſo allow that Gods preſcribing Forms of Prayer by inſpired perſons, is ſo far forth a Warrant for our imitation, as the thing it ſelf is good and uſeful, and lawfully imitable by us. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That though it follows, that becauſe God by inſpired perſons hath preſcribed Forms of Prayer, therefore the Church may preſcribe them upon Gods reaſons; yet it doth by no means follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may preſcribe them as Scripture or divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this Objection allows the preſcribing of Forms of Prayer to be lawful of its own nature,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:410"/> that is, to be void of all intrinſick evil, and to have no contrariety in the nature of it to the eternal Rules and Dictates of right reaſon: for this Objection granting, as it doth, that God hath preſcribed Forms of Prayer, muſt either admit that God may do, and hath done that which is intrinſically evil, and repugnant to right reaſon, or grant that the preſcribing of Forms hath no intrinſick evil in it. And in particular, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that our Saviours preſcribing his Form was a tacit approbation of other Forms that were preſcribed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that not onely by God, but by men too: for though beſides thoſe Forms which were preſcribed by God for the publick Worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their Doctors tell us of ſundry Forms of humane Compoſure that were uſed in their Temple and Synagogues in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's time, yet he was ſo far from diſapproving either them, or that which <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> taught his Diſciples, that in conformity to the later, he preſcribed a Form to his own Diſciples; which Form of his, as our Learned <hi>Gregory</hi> hath proved, he collected out of Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which were then uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in whoſe Books the ſeveral parts and clauſes of it are extant almoſt <hi>verbatim</hi> to this day: and certainly had he diſapproved their Forms as evil and ſinful, he would never have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his own Prayer out of 'em. Since therefore our Saviour hath not onely given us a Form, but hath alſo given it under ſuch circumſtances as do plainly ſignifie his approbation of other Forms, it neceſſarily follows, that either he hath approved that which is evil, or that Forms of Prayer are not evil.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Objection muſt allow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of publick Forms to be not onely lawful in it ſelf, but alſo good and uſeful: for whatſoever God doth, he is directed to do by his own infallible Wiſdom; which always proceeds upon the beſt reaſons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:410"/> the beſt ends of action to him, and the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to compaſs and obtain 'em: when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we grant that God hath done ſuch or ſuch a thing, we muſt either allow the thing to be good and uſeful to ſome excellent end and purpoſe, or ſuppoſe that he did not conſult his Wiſdom in it, or that his Wiſdom was miſtaken. He therefore who allows that God hath preſcribed Forms of Prayer, muſt either blaſpheme his Wiſdom, or grant the preſcribing 'em to be good and uſeful. But it is objected that the preſcribing 'em was good and uſeful onely at that time, and under thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances wherein they were preſcribed: as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the times of the Old Teſtament it may be allowed, that the preſcribing of Forms might be good and uſeful, the Jews, to whom they were preſcribed, being a carnal, dull, and ſtupid People; and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the times and circumſtances of the Goſpel-ſtate, which is ſo vaſtly different, the preſcribing 'em may not onely ceaſe to be good, but become hurtful and injurious. To which in ſhort, I anſwer, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it were the Carnality, Dulneſs, and Stupidity of the <hi>Jews</hi> that render'd Forms ſo uſeful to 'em; I doubt that as to thoſe particulars, the caſe is not ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with the generality of Chriſtians, but that they may be uſeful ſtill: and though 'tis to be hoped we are not altogether ſo very dull and carnal as they were, yet, as it hath been made appear in the former part of this Treatiſe, we are not ſo perfectly refin'd from Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Carnality, but that Forms of Prayer may ſtill be very uſeful to us. But, <hi>2ly.</hi> this Objection allows not onely that there were Forms of Prayer preſcribed in the Old Teſtament, but that our Saviour himſelf hath alſo preſcribed one in the New, for all ſucceſſive Ages to pray by; and if ſo, then we muſt either blaſpheme the Wiſdom of our Saviour for preſcribing what is vain and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:411"/> uſeleſs, or grant the preſcription of Forms to be good and uſeful, not onely for the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but alſo for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-ſtate.</p>

                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Objection muſt alſo allow that Gods preſcribing Forms of Prayer by inſpired perſons is ſo far forth a Warrant for our imitation, as the thing it ſelf is good and uſeful, and imitable by us: if God doth ſuch or ſuch a thing becauſe it is good, and uſeful to ſome end, that is a ſufficient Warrant for us to do the ſame, provided we have the ſame reaſon: for, to imitate God is not onely our priviledge, but our duty. But how can we be ſaid to imitate Him, if ſo far as our power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, we do not the ſame things that he doth, when we have the ſame reaſons? Since therefore God as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour of his Church hath preſcribed Forms of Prayer becauſe they are good and uſeful, thoſe whom he hath ſubſtituted to govern for him, are thereby ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently warranted to preſcribe 'em too, ſo long as they continue ſo; ſo that Gods preſcribing 'em is a ſufficient argument that they are uſeful; and that they are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is a ſufficient reaſon for the Governours of the Church to preſcribe 'em alſo, becauſe for that reaſon God himſelf hath preſcribed 'em: and certainly our Spiritual Governours, who are in Gods ſtead, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently warranted to do as God hath done, when they have Gods own reaſon to do it. Againſt this I know nothing can be objected, but onely that common and fundamental Principle of all our Separations, <hi>viz.</hi> That God himſelf hath forbid the preſcribing of any thing in or about his Worſhip but what he himſelf hath preſcribed: and therefore whatſoever reaſon there may be for it, no other Forms ought to be preſcribed but what are of his own inditing and preſcription. The falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which hath been ſufficiently demonſtrated in <hi>the Caſe about Indifferent Things:</hi> And therefore as to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:411"/> the matter in hand, I ſhall onely ſay, that the Objection ſtrikes with equal force againſt Extemporary words which God hath not preſcribed, as againſt Forms of words which he hath not preſcribed: for as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, <hi>Part</hi> 1. and ſhall yet further prove hereafter, praying Extempore by our own Gift of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is no more preſcribed by God than praying by a Form; and therefore the words of Extempore Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are no more preſcribed by him than the words of Forms: ſo that if the latter may not be admitted into the Worſhip of God, becauſe they are not preſcribed by him, neither may the former. And indeed, he who prays extempore, doth as much preſcribe a Form of words to the people in publick Worſhip, as he who prays by a Form, their devout deſires and affections being equally confined to this particular Set of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in both. And if each ſingle Presbyter may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Form of words to the People which God hath not preſcribed 'em, how much more may the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church? Admitting therefore that ſuch words may be preſcribed in Prayer as God hath not preſcribed, his preſcribing of Forms of Prayer muſt be a ſufficient Warrant for the Governours of his Church to preſcribe 'em when they have his reaſon ſo to do.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, That though it follows that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God by inſpir'd perſons hath preſcribed Forms of Prayer, therefore the Governours of the Church may preſcribe 'em upon Gods reaſons; yet it doth by no means follow, that therefore they may preſcribe 'em as Scripture, or Divine Inſpiration. As briefly to inſtance in another caſe: Becauſe God the ſupream Governour of his Church, hath taken care to inſtruct it by inſpired perſons, it thence follows that thoſe whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to govern it, ſhould take care to inſtruct it too; but it doth by no means follow, either that they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:412"/> ſhould inſtruct it by inſpired perſons, or that they ſhould pretend to inſtruct it by Divine Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for they have the ſame reaſon that God had to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it's good and uſeful to the beſt purpoſes. And ſo far as they have the ſame reaſon with God, they ought to do the ſame thing; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the ſame reaſon that God had to inſtruct it by inſpired perſons, becauſe 'tis not in their power ſo to do: and therefore as they cannot be obliged to it, ſo neither ought they to pretend to it. And ſo it is as to preſcribing Forms of Prayer: for, That God himſelf hath preſcribed 'em to his Church by immediate Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may be a ſufficient Warrant for Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to preſcribe 'em too; but it cannot be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Warrant for 'em to preſcribe 'em by immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: for they may have the ſame reaſons to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe 'em that God had, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are good and uſeful for publick Devotion; but they cannot have the ſame reaſon to preſcribe 'em by immediate Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe that is not in their power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twould be a manifeſt cheat for 'em to pretend to it. Had they the ſame common reaſons with God for both, his Example would warrant 'em not onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe 'em, but to preſcribe 'em as Scripture and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration; but ſince there is a peculiar reaſon why they may not preſcribe 'em as Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot without manifeſt falſhood and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, which reaſon is not at all applicable to the bare and ſimple preſcribing 'em, therefore it doth by no means follow, that if they may lawfully do the latter, they may lawfully do the former alſo. Having thus anſwered the Objections of our Brethren, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that ſuppoſing that Principle were true, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing ought to be admitted into the Worſhip of God, but what God hath commanded; yet it doth not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:412"/> univerſally conclude againſt the admitting Forms of Prayer into his Worſhip, becauſe he himſelf hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome Forms, and by commanding them hath licenſed and authorized the Governours of his Church to preſcribe others upon the ſame reaſons.</p>
                           <p>I proceed therefore to the ſecond general Head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, which was to ſhew, that ſuppoſing this Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing ought to be admitted into the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God but what is commanded by him, did conclude againſt Forms of Prayer, it equally concludes againſt conceived or extempore Prayers; becauſe theſe are no more commanded by God than Forms, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as to publick Worſhip, have much leſs claim to Divine Authority than Forms: but we will ſuppoſe at preſent the Forms of Prayer were not at all comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet this we aſſert makes no more againſt them than it doth againſt Extempore Prayers, there being no command of God requiring us to pray Extempore, or to utter our affections in Prayer in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and expreſſions. It is indeed very confidently aſſerted by our Brethren, That whereſoever we are commanded to pray vocally, we are commanded to pray in our own conceptions and words: but that this is not ſo, is evident from what has been diſcours'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath commanded men to pray in ſundry Forms of his own compoſure; and ſure in thoſe caſes wherein they were commanded to pray vocally in Gods Conceptions and Words, they could not be commanded to pray vocally in their own. Thus far therefore our Brethren muſt grant, if they will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by expreſs words of Scripture, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to pray vocally are not to be always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of praying Extempore, but ſometimes of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a Form: and therefore by the way, I cannot but wonder why they ſhould appropriate as they do
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:413"/> the name of vocal Prayer to praying in their own words, and not as well allow the expreſſing our deſires to God in the words of a Form to be called Prayer, but onely ſaying or reading of a Prayer: for I would fain know, did the Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> praiſe the Lord when they praiſed him in the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph?</hi> did they pray to him when they expreſt their deſires to God in thoſe Petitionary <hi>Pſalms</hi> which were directed to be uſed in their publick Worſhip? or did the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> pray when they pronounc'd the Lords Prayer in their ſolemn Devotions? If ſo, then there is no doubt but ſpeaking to God in a Form of words may as well be called Prayer, as ſpeaking to him in our own Extempore words: for vocal Prayer conſiſts in the ſpeaking of our devout affections to God; and if they are ſpoken, they are vocal, whether it be in our own Extempore words, or in a Form: if we onely ſpeak the words of Prayer, whether they be Form'd or Extempore, and do not ſend up our affections with them, we onely ſay a vocal Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but do not vocally pray; but if the words we ſpeak carry our affections with them, we vocally pray whether they be the one or t'other. If our Brethren can prove that vocal Prayer conſiſts in ſpeaking our deſires to God in words of our own Extempore effuſion, we will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield them the whole Cauſe; but this they will never be able to prove, whilſt there are ſo many inſtances in Scripture of vocal Prayer by a Form. But they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that whatſoever inſtances there may be of Forms in Old times, God hath declared in the New Teſtament that it is his will we ſhould pray by our own Gifts of Expreſſion and Utterance for the future; which if they can prove, we will readily yield that praying by Forms is unlawful, though not impoſſible: but as for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of proof, they do not ſo much as pretend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any expreſs prohibition of praying by Forms; and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:413"/> all that they urge is onely ſome remote and far-fetcht conſequences againſt it. Now ſuppoſing it had been the will of God and our Saviour, that we ſhould not pray by Forms, it ſeems very ſtrange, that in all the New Teſtament there ſhould be no expreſs prohibition of it; for <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> as I ſhewed before, had ſeveral Forms preſcribed them in their publick Worſhip; and that they uſed Forms in our Saviours time, not onely their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Rabbins</hi> do aſſert, but <hi>Philo</hi> himſelf, who lived not longer after, makes mention of <hi>the holy Prayers that</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Phil. de victim.</hi> p. 843.</note> 
                              <hi>were offered by the Prieſts in the time of Sacrifice.</hi> And the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Chronicle, as hath been obſerved upon this. Argument, makes mention of a <hi>Book</hi> in the year of the World 4713, <hi>which contained thoſe Songs and Prayers that were always uſed before their Sacrifices.</hi> And ſince the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were a moſt tenacious People of their Rites and Cuſtoms, were always wont in their publick Adminiſtrations to worſhip God by Forms, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary was it to have given ſome expreſs prohibition of them, had it been his intent to exclude them out of his Worſhip for the future? eſpecially conſidering that the Sect of the Eſſenes, who, as it's highly probable, did of all the Sects of the <hi>Jews,</hi> moſt readily embrace Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, are particularly remarkt by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> for that <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>De Bel. Jud. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 785.</note> they did uſe before the Sun-riſing, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, certain Prayers which they receiv'd from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. And when thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who were the moſt diſpoſed for Chriſtianity, and did moſt readily embrace it (inſomuch that in a little time the whole Sect of them ſeems to have been ſwallow'd up into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church) were ſo addicted to the uſe of Forms, how can it be imagin'd, that had our Saviour intended they ſhould uſe them no longer, he would not have taken care to give them ſome expreſs warning of it? But when, inſtead of ſo doing, he bids them, when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:414"/> they pray'd, to <hi>ſay Our Father,</hi> how could they otherwiſe apprehend, but that it was his meaning, that they ſhould ſtill continue to pray by a Form, as they had always done before? And if he had not ſo intended, it ſeems very ſtrange he ſhould take no care to undeceive them, or to prevent their being deceiv'd in this matter by ſome expreſs command to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for conſidering all, there was not a more urgent occaſion for an expreſs prohibition of any Rite or Uſage of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, than of this of praying by a Form, ſuppoſing the prohibition of it had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and yet I dare boldly affirm, that there is not one Rite of that Church which our Saviour intended to forbid, but is much more plainly and expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den than this is pretended to be. For the proof of this, and which is more, of the main aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no injunction in Scripture of praying by our own gifts of utterance without a Form, I ſhall particularly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſeveral Pretences from which our Brethren infer ſuch an Injunction.</p>
                           <p>1. Therefore, they pretend that God hath promiſed and given to all good Chriſtians an ability to utter their minds in vocal Prayer to him; and therefore for them to omit the uſing this ability to the end for which God hath given it to them, and pray by Forms of other mens compoſure, is contrary to his mind and intention: which Objection hath for the main been anſwered already, <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Caſe</hi> 2. wherein it hath been prov'd at large, that this ability which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is promiſed and given by God for the purpoſe of vocal Prayer, is a common Gift which God hath no more appropriated to Prayer, than to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common end of utterance and elocution; and that therefore to omit the uſing it in Prayer, is no more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:414"/> contrary to the intention of God, than to omit the uſing it upon any other juſt and lawful occaſion. But becauſe our Brethren urge ſome places of Scripture to prove that God hath promiſed and given it meerly to inable them for vocal Prayer, I ſhall briefly inquire, whether it be ſo or no. Firſt therefore they urge <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>I will pour out upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the ſpirit of grace and ſupplications,</hi> which, as I ſhew'd before, <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Caſe</hi> 1. ſingnifies nothing to their purpoſe. 'Tis urg'd indeed, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> here tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated Supplications, doth always denote vocal Prayer, and that therefore pouring out the Spirit of Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt imply communicating an ability to Pray vocally; but this is not ſo: for if we examine the places where this word is uſed, we ſhall find 'tis no more reſtrain'd to vocal Prayer, than any other word by which Prayer is expreſs'd in Scripture; ſo that it may be as truly ſaid, that Prayer always ſignifies vocal Prayer, as that this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for Prayer doth ſo. Nor indeed doth it neceſſarily ſignifie vocal Prayer in the onely place that is urg'd to prove that it always ſignifies ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> Pſalm 28. 2. <hi>Hear the voice of my ſupplication when I cry unto thee:</hi> for this phraſe, the voice of my Supplication, and the voice of my Prayer, is a <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> and denotes no more, than my Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or my Prayer: for ſo in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 10. it's ſaid, <hi>The voice of thy brother's bloud cries from the ground;</hi> that is, it cry'd juſt as mental Prayer doth, without any material voice or ſound, yet ſo as to move God as effectually as the loudeſt vocal Prayer: ſo that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> might cry to God with his mind, without opening his lips; and ſuppoſing he did, his Prayer had a voice which God could hear as well as if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd it never ſo loudly. But then in other places
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:415"/> this <hi>Hebrew</hi> word plainly ſignifies at large both men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and vocal Prayer indifferently: ſo in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 86. 6. <hi>Give ear, O Lord, unto my Prayer, attend to the voice of my Supplications:</hi> and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6. 9. <hi>The Lord hath heard my Supplication, the Lord will receive my Prayer.</hi> And as Prayer and Supplications ſignifie the ſame thing, ſo the word Supplications is uſed to expreſs Prayer in general; as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. <hi>They ſhall come with weeping, and with ſupplications will I lead them:</hi> where the word plainly denotes Prayer in general, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction to any kind of it; and ſo in ſeveral other places, which it would be needleſs to name. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were true, that the word were always uſed for vocal Prayer, there is no doubt but this promiſe of pouring out the Spirit of Supplications, intends a much greater good than the Gift of extempore utterance in Prayer, of which bad men may have a greater ſhare than the moſt devout and pious; and if it doth denote a greater good, what can that be but the gift of pious and heavenly affections in vocal Prayer, of which we may as well partake in praying vocally by a Form, as by our own extemporary utterance? But 'tis yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urg'd, that in purſuance of this promiſe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son, crying, Abba, Father;</hi> and that we <hi>have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father, Rom.</hi> 8. 15. Now becauſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> ſignifies crying with a loud voice, 'tis from hence inferr'd, that we are gifted and inabled by the Spirit, to expreſs our ſelves to God in vocal Prayer, and that therefore we ought not to pray by Forms. To which I anſwer, firſt, That if by any thing in theſe words we are obliged to cry vocally to God by our own Gifts, we are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to cry to him in theſe words, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> in all our vocal Prayers, becauſe that is the cry or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:415"/> Prayer which the Spirit inables us to make; and the Text is every whit as expreſs for the one as the other: and therefore if crying by the Spirit muſt needs denote receiving a Gift from him to pray vocally, then crying, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> by the Spirit, muſt needs denote receiving a Gift from him to pray vocally, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Father;</hi> and conſequently, not to uſe theſe very words, when we cry vocally to God, will be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſinful an omiſſion, as not to cry vocally by our own gift of utterance or expreſſion. Secondly, I utterly deny that crying here doth neceſſarily denote vocal Prayer: for how often do we find the word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to things that have no voice at all? Thus <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 40. <hi>I tell you, that if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out;</hi> and yet no body imagines that our Saviour meant that the ſtones ſhould make a Speech to prove him the true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Thus alſo the Labourers hire unjuſtly detain'd by rich op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, is ſaid to cry to God, <hi>James</hi> 5. 4. not becauſe it offer'd any vocal Prayer to him, but becauſe it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and provok'd him, as the vocal crys of injured perſons do us, to avenge them upon their oppreſſors: and in this ſence mental Prayer may be ſaid to cry, becauſe it moves and affects God as effectually as vocal. And accordingly it's ſaid of the <hi>Jews, That their heart cryed unto the Lord, Lam.</hi> 2. 18. ſo that crying unto God ſignifies in the ſame latitude with Prayer, which includes both vocal and mental. Thirdly, That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that our crying, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> by the Spirit, were to be underſtood of vocal Prayer, yet all that can be gather'd from it is onely this, that when we pray vocally, we are inabled by the holy Spirit to addreſs our ſelves to God with boldneſs and aſſurance, as to a kind and merciful Father; and this we may as well do, when we pray by a Form, as when we pray ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:416"/> for if we never cry, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> by the Spirit, but when we word our own Prayers, we can no more be ſaid to do it when we joyn with a publick extempore Prayer, than when we joyn with a publick Form, becauſe we word our own Prayers in neither.</p>
                           <p>But 'tis further inſiſted on, that the Scripture makes mention of a Gift of utterance, which the Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to true believers, as particularly 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7. which Gift, ſay they, was doubtleſs given for the purpoſe of Praying, as well as of Preaching. To which, in ſhort, I anſwer, That it is moſt evident, that this Gift of utterance, or readineſs of Speech, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and peculiar to the primitive Ages of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts, wherein the Preachers of the Goſpel were ordinarily inſpired with a ſupernatural fluency, aſſurance, and volubility of Speech: for as St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> obſerves, <hi>Hom.</hi> 24. <hi>ad Epheſ.</hi> c. 6. this Gift of utterance is that which our Saviour promiſed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 11. <hi>When they ſhall lead you and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you up, take no thought before-hand what ye ſhall ſpeak, neither do ye premeditate; but whatſoever ſhall be given to you in that hour, that ſpeak ye, for it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> So that what they ſpoke was by immediate inſpiration, without any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought or premeditation of their own; and it being God that ſpoke immediately in and through them, what they deliver'd was the Word of God; and this Gift certainly no ſober Diſſenter will pretend to: and that this gift of utterance was extraordinary, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 4. where it is ſaid, <hi>That the Apoſtles were fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance:</hi> ſo that we may as well pretend to the Gift of Tongues, as to this Gift of Utterance, they being both miraculous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:416"/>
                           <p>This, I think, is a ſufficient Anſwer to thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which our Brethren urge, to prove that God hath promiſed and given to every good Chriſtian an ability to expreſs their minds to him in Prayer, theſe being the onely Scriptures that are urg'd by them to prove it. But they object yet further, That ſuppoſing God hath not given to all Chriſtians the Gift of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extempore, yet to a great many he hath; and therefore theſe at leaſt he requires to pray by their Gift and not by a Form: for ſo in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>He expreſly requires them not to neglect the gift that is in them, but to ſtir up the gift of God that is in them:</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. <hi>And as they have received the gift, even ſo to miniſter the ſame to one another:</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 10. <hi>And that having gifts differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the grace given to us, whether propheſie to propheſie, according to the proportion of Faith.</hi> And if they are obliged by theſe Texts to exerciſe their Gifts in general, then are they obliged by them to exerciſe their Gift of praying extempore in particular. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which, I ſhall need do no more than explain the nature of the Gifts here mentioned; from which, I doubt not, it will evidently appear, that theſe Texts make nothing to the purpoſe for which they are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

So alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given to us,</hi> that is, being put into various Offices and Capacities, according to the various diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Divine Grace, <hi>whether it be that of propheſie, let us propheſie, according to the proportion of faith;</hi> i. e. according to thoſe principles of faith and good life which are known and received among us: <hi>or whether it be Miniſtry,</hi> that is, Deaconſhip, <hi>let us wait on our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring: or he that teacheth, on teaching: or he that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity: he that ruleth, with diligence: he that ſheweth mercy, with chearfulneſs.</hi> In all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the deſigne is to excite them faithfully to diſcharge thoſe ſeveral Offices whereunto God had call'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them: for ſo the word Gift, as all agree, doth in Scripture frequently ſignifie an Office; and that in both theſe Texts it is ſo to be underſtood, is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe things which the Apoſtles exhort them to, are the proper acts and exerciſes of thoſe ſeveral Offices and Capacities of Biſhops, Presbyters, Deacons, and rich men: and the Argument by which they exhort them, is, that they had receiv'd the proper Gifts to which theſe acts appertain. So that if by theſe Gifts we underſtand abilities to perform thoſe acts, we ſhall force the Argument to prove too much, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the duty of every one to Rule, and Teach, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and Propheſie, that hath receiv'd an ability to do ſo; whereas, in truth, none can have a right to perform theſe acts, (as all ſober Diſſenters will acknowledge) but onely ſuch as are veſted with the Offices to which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:418"/> they appertain. Wherefore either this Argument, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received Gifts,</hi> muſt oblige all men to rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are able to do ſo, or elſe by Gifts muſt be meant the Offices to which thoſe acts of ruling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belong. But you will ſay, 'Tis evident that by ſome of theſe Gifts muſt be meant the ability of doing the acts here ſpecifi'd, as particularly that of diſtributing to the Poor, and ſhewing Mercy. I anſwer, That as for theſe acts, the meer ability to relieve the poor and miſerable not onely authorizes, but obliges us to them; and by putting it in our power, God doth as much make it our Office to relieve them, as if he had ſet us apart to it by a ſolemn Ordination: and becauſe the ability here confers the Office, the Gift, though it ſignifies the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, muſt neceſſarily include the ability too; but in all thoſe other particulars, where the Office and Ability are diſtinct things, the Gift muſt ſignifie the Office, diſtinct from the Ability; becauſe here it being the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and not the Ability that authorizes and obliges us to perform the acts, the neceſſity of performing the acts muſt be argued from the Office, and not from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. So then, if by the Gifts here ſpoken of, onely ſuch and ſuch Offices are intended, by what conſequence doth it follow, that becauſe thoſe who are veſted with theſe Offices, are here exhorted faithfully to diſcharge them, therefore thoſe who are able to pray extempore, are hereby obliged to do ſo? Our Brethren may as well argue from theſe words, that all thoſe who are able to rule, are obliged to exerciſe the Epiſcopal Office, as that thoſe who are able to pray extempore, are obliged to pray extempore. But then thirdly and laſtly, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That ſuppoſing that by theſe Gifts were not meant Offices, but onely Abilities, yet all that can hence be argued is, that thoſe who have them, are obliged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them ſo far forth as is conſiſtent with edification:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:419"/> for ſo the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>That all things be done to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification;</hi> and to be ſure, what he exhorts to in one Text, doth not at all claſh with what he exhorts in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and even of thoſe extraordinary Gifts that were poured out in the Primitive times, the Apoſtle declares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that thoſe who had them were no farther o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to uſe them in the Church, than the uſe of them tended to edification, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 6, 18, 19. and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the Gift of Tongues, though it was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inſpired, he totally forbids them the uſe and exerciſe of it where there was no interpreter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 27, 28. If then we are not to exerciſe our Gifts, meerly becauſe they are Gifts, but becauſe the exerciſe of them tends to Edification; and if when they do not tend to it, we are to ſuſpend the exerciſe of them, as it's plain we are, by this inſtance of the Gift of Tongues; then, although by the Gifts mention'd in the above-nam'd Text were meant Abilities, and not Offices, yet it doth not follow, that thoſe who have an ability to pray extempore, ſhould therefore be obliged to exerciſe it any further than as it tends to Edification: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if praying by a Form in publick Worſhip be more for the publick Edification, (and that it is, hath been proved, <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Caſe</hi> 3.) we are no more oblig'd to pray extempore, though we have an ability to do ſo, than he who had the Gift of Tongues was to exerciſe his Gift, when he could not edifie the publick by it; and if we ought to ſuſpend the exerciſe of our Gift, when it is not at all edifying, at leaſt we are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to exerciſe it when we may perform the ſame thing, without exerciſing it, in a more edifying manner. Having thus ſhewn the inſufficiency of thoſe Scriptures which our Brethren urge to prove that thoſe who are able to pray extempore are oblig'd to do ſo, it remains that hitherto no diſcovery can be made of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:419"/> of Scripture by which we are oblig'd to pray vocally by our own gift or ability of expreſſion: for upon the utmoſt enquiry I can make, theſe which I have anſwer'd, are the onely Texts which with any ſhew of argument our Brethren produce to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Suppoſing therefore it were true, that nothing ought to be admitted into God's Worſhip, but what he hath commanded, yet this makes a great deal more againſt praying by our own Gift, and in our own words and expreſſions, than it doth againſt praying by a Form, becauſe there are expreſs Commands for praying in ſome caſes by a Form, but there is no Command at all for praying by our own Gifts. Since therefore there are ſundry inſtances of God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Forms of Prayer, and ſince no inſtance can be given of his requiring us to pray by our own Gifts and Abilities, this certainly is a ſufficient Scripture-warrant of the lawfulneſs of worſhipping him by Forms.</p>
                           <p>I proceed to the ſecond Enquiry included in this Caſe, and that is, Whether there be any Warrant for the uſe of Forms in pure Antiquity? For it is pretended by ſome of our Brethren, that in the primitive Ages of the Church all publick Prayers were perform'd by the Gifts and Abilities of him that miniſter'd, and that there was no ſuch things as Forms admitted into their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip: for the proof of which bold Aſſertion, they onely urge two or three doubtful Authorities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a whole current of plain and expreſs Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to the contrary. In the proſecution therefore of this Enquiry, I ſhall endeavour, 1. To anſwer thoſe Authorities which are objected by our Brethren againſt the uſe of Forms in the Primitive Ages: 2. To prove that they were uſed in thoſe Ages, by a ſhort Hiſtorical Account of the Matter of Fact.</p>

                           <p>Another Teſtimony they object againſt the uſe of Forms, is that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who affirms, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Sine Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore, quia de pectore Oremus. Tertul.

When therefore he ſays, that they pray'd without a Monitor, his meaning muſt be, ſay they, that they pray'd without any one to direct them what Form of words they were to pray in.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:420"/> To which I anſwer, firſt, That ſuppoſing he here ſpeaks of the publick Worſhip, as it ſeems moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, it's evident that by this phraſe, <hi>without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor,</hi> he cannot mean, without any one to dictate or preſcribe a Form of words to them; for in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary publick Prayers, their Miniſter was the Mouth of the Congregation; and whether he pray'd by Form, or Extempore, his words were a Form of words to them, in which they were obliged to frame and expreſs their Devotions: ſo that either this phraſe, <hi>without a Monitor,</hi> muſt import, that they had none to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate and miniſter to them in their publick Prayers, or it cannot import that they had no publick Forms to pray by, becauſe if they had any to dictate to them, his extempore Prayer would have been as much a Monitor to direct them what words to pray in, as if it had been a ſtated Form of Liturgy. Whatever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this obſcure phraſe means, it's certain it cannot mean without a Form, unleſs it be allowed to mean without a Miniſter too. But then, <hi>2ly.</hi> not to take notice of the various gueſſes which learned men make at the meaning of it, and by which it is ſufficiently vindicated from meaning without a Form of Prayer, it ſeems to me moſt probable, that, <hi>without a Monitor,</hi> here, is meant, without any one to correct them, when either they repeated, or the Miniſter recited the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers falſly: for the Gods of the <hi>Heathen</hi> being various, and having each their various Offices and Provinces allotted them, it was the manner of their Prieſts to begin their publick Sacrifices with a Form of Prayer, <note n="(f)" place="margin">A.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:421"/> ill <hi>Omen:</hi> But how could he prevent this, unleſs it were his Office to admoniſh and correct either the Prieſt or People, or both, when he read, or they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated them falſly? This Monitor therefore was not he who read the Prayers, or dictated them to the People out of the Book, but he whoſe Office 'twas to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee either that they were rightly dictated, or rightly repeated, or both: and indeed, there was more need that he ſhould overſee that they were rightly repeated, than that they were rightly dictated, becauſe they were dictated out of a Book; and ſo could not be ſo eaſily dictated as repeated falſly. But ſuppoſe his Office were to overſee both, yet ſince they were dictated in order to their being repeated, he onely overſaw their being dictated rightly, in order to their being repeated rightly. When therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>We pray without a Monitor,</hi> his meaning is not that we pray without a Prieſt to dictate our Prayers to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were out of a Book, or extempore; but that we pray without a <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> or Overſeer, either to admoniſh our People of their repeating the Prayers falſly, or to admoniſh our Prieſts of their dictating them falſly, in order to the Peoples repeating them rightly; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we pray from our hearts:</hi> which words may admit of a twofold interpretation; firſt, becauſe we do not vocally repeat our Prayers after our Prieſt, but onely joyn our affections with them, and ſend up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our hearts and deſires after them; or, <hi>2ly.</hi> becauſe we can ſay our Prayers by heart, and ſo are in no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of repeating them falſly, and conſequently have no ſuch need of a Monitor to obſerve and correct us: for it is well known how much <hi>Tertullian</hi> in all his Writings affects to imitate and expreſs the Greek, which renders him oftentimes ſo very obſcure; and therefore it's probable enough, as hath been obſerv'd,

That this is the true account of this difficult phraſe, I will not confidently affirm, becauſe it is onely my own ſingle gueſs; but whether it be or no, it's certain it can no more ſignifie without a Form of Prayer, than without a Miniſter to pray extempore, the one being as much a Monitor to the People, as the other.</p>

                           <p>And now I proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, which was, to prove the uſe of Forms of Prayer in the primitive Ages, by a ſhort Hiſtorical Account of the Matter of Fact. That in the firſt Age there was a Gift of praying extempore by immediate inſpiration, ſeems highly probable, both from what the Apoſtle diſcourſes of <hi>praying in unknown Languages,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and from what St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> aſſerts concerning it, <note n="(r)" place="margin">Chryſ. <hi>in Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</note> viz. <hi>That together with thoſe miraculous Gifts which were then poured out, there was a Gift of Praying, which was called by the Apoſtle, a Spirit, by which he who was endued with it, poured out Prayers for all the People:</hi> and while this Gift continued, perhaps (which how
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:423"/> long it was, is very uncertain) there might no other Form be uſed in publick Worſhip in thoſe places, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where it abounded, but onely that of the Lord's Prayer; and it may be in imitation of this Gift, upon which even in the Apoſtles time the Chriſtians were apt to over-value themſelves, ſome might affect to pray extempore after it was wholly expired; but it is highly probable, that upon the ceaſing or abatement of it, it was in moſt places immediately ſupplied by Forms of Prayer, which were compoſed either of the words, or according to the method and manner of thoſe inſpired Prayers, by Apoſtolical perſons that heard and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred them; for ſo, as the ſame St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> goes on, <note n="(s)" place="margin">Chryſ. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>For we being ignorant of many things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for us, do ask many things which are unprofitable; and therefore this Gift of Prayer was given to ſome one perſon that was there, i. e.</hi> in the Congregation, <hi>who ask'd for all that which was profitable for the univerſal Church, and taught others to do ſo;</hi> that is, to form Prayers according to thoſe inſpired Models: for though I do not pretend that there were no other Prayers uſed in publick, but onely Forms either in or preſently after the Age of the Apoſtles, yet it ſeems moſt probable that even from the Apoſtolical Age ſome part at leaſt of the publick Worſhip was perform'd in Forms of Prayer; and if ſo, we have all the reaſon in the world to conclude, that theſe Forms were compoſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Pattern of thoſe primitive inſpired Prayers. Now that there were Forms from the Apoſtolical Age, ſeems highly probable, becauſe, ſo far as we can find, there never was any diſpute among Chriſtians concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the lawfulneſs of praying by a Form. Had this way of praying been introduc'd after the Primitive Ages, it would have been a moſt obſervable innovation upon the Primitive Chriſtianity, and that in ſuch a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:423"/> publick matter of fact, that every Chriſtian could not but take notice of it. Now that ſuch an open Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be ſo ſilently admitted into the Church, without the leaſt conteſt or oppoſition, ſeems very ſtrange, if not incredible. 'Tis true, there were ſome Innovations that crept in very early, without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but none that was of ſuch a publick cognizance as this; and unleſs the whole Chriſtian World had been faſt aſleep, it is hardly ſuppoſeable they would ever have admitted ſuch a remarkable alteration in their publick Worſhip, as from praying extempore, to pray by a Form, without the leaſt contradiction. If therefore praying by a Form were an Innovation upon their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Worſhip, it was certainly the moſt lucky and fortunate one that ever was of that kind, there being no one Innovation beſides it of that publick nature, but what hath always found powerful Adverſaries to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. But not to inſiſt upon probabilities, we will inquire into the matter of fact: And firſt, we have thoſe three ancient Liturgies, which are attributed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>James;</hi> which though they have been all of them wofully corrupted by later Ages, yet are, doubtleſs, as to the purer parts of them, of great antiquity, and, probably, even from the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Age: for beſides that there are many things in them which have a ſtrong reliſh of the ſimplicity and piety of that Age, that of St. <hi>James</hi> in particular was of great authority in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereof he was the firſt Biſhop, in St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s time, who wrote a Comment upon it, <note n="(t)" place="margin">Cyril <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech.

For firſt, there was one <hi>Faithful Commin</hi> a Dominican Friar, who in the 9th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> to ſeduce the People from the Church, thereby to ſerve the ends of Popery, began to pray extempore with ſuch wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Zeal and Fervour, that he deluded a great many ſimple People; for which he was afterwards amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by the Pope <note n="(d)" place="margin">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:430"/> he was examined, <hi>That he had been ſix years in</hi> England, <hi>labouring to refine the Proteſtants, and to take off all ſmacks of Ceremonies, and to make the Church purer</hi>

The affirmative of which is ſufficiently proved in <hi>the Caſe of Indifferent Things.</hi> And indeed, if the Impoſition of Praying in publick by Forms, though lawful in it ſelf, may not be lawfully complied with, then neither may the Impoſition of praying extempore; and if ſo, then we muſt act quite contrary to what we are commanded by Authority, and pray by Form when we are commanded to pray extempore, as well as extempore when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pray by Form: and if in lawful things Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can oblige us to comply with this by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the contrary, our liberty will be altogether as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſtraint this way as the other, becauſe we ſhall

                        <p>I Believe all Conſidering Perſons are by this time ſenſible what advantage the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make of the Separation of ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And the ill effects of it at preſent, and the worſe which we have reaſon to fear, are ſo very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, that it may now be hoped the Conſideration hereof will ſomething abate thoſe Prejudices of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt us, which we think have hitherto hindred the prevailing of our Reaſons. Though Prejudice is hard to be remov'd, yet 'tis not impoſſible. Several Ingenuous Perſons of that Perſuaſion have been reſcu'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:433"/> from their Prejudices againſt our Communion, when the miſchief of theſe Diviſions was not ſo apparent as 'tis now. I truſt therefore, that at this time many more will, and I pray God that all of them may ſeriouſly and impartially look over the Grounds upon which they have kept up the Separation. For I am perſuaded that their Objections againſt our Communion are not of that Conſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I have with great pleaſure read ſome ſhort Diſcourſes lately Publiſht that tend to this purpoſe, the Good Spirit where with they are written ſeeming to be a very likely means of conveying the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with all its advantage into the Minds of thoſe that ſhall take the pains to read them. And though I think that which hath been ſaid already, is enough to ſatisfie Judicious Men, yet by the perſuaſion of ſome Friends, I have taken upon me to Anſwer thoſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Objections againſt the Publick Service of God by the <hi>Book of Common Prayer,</hi> which the Diſſenters are ſaid to inſiſt moſt upon. I muſt confeſs that I have always thought the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to be ſuch a truly <hi>Evangelical</hi> Form of <hi>Publick Worſhip,</hi> that it would rather have invited <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, than kept them from it. And I believe, if the Diſſenters would ſeriouſly read over that Sermon of Dr. <hi>Beverege</hi> concerning the <hi>Excellency and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of the Common Prayer,</hi> they would go near to be of the ſame mind. And I hope many of them are ſo, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only as to thoſe Particulars wherein they are not ſo well ſatisfied: And therefore I ſhall endeavour through Gods aſſiſtance to lay ſome things together, of which People of ordinary Capacities may make a Judgments and which may afford reaſonable ſatisfaction to thoſe that Doubt.</p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:433"/>
                        <p>It is by ſome pretended, That the <hi>Confeſſions of Sin</hi> in our Liturgie are <hi>too General,</hi> and that there are <hi>many Particular Sins</hi> which ought to have been <hi>Diſtinctly</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, of which there is no mention.</p>
                        <p>Now I deſire thoſe that are of this Mind to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there is hardly any thing in Publick Worſhip which requires more Caution and Prudence in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of it, than that Confeſſion of Sin which is to be made by the <hi>whole Congregation:</hi> It may be too <hi>Looſe</hi> and <hi>General</hi> on the one ſide, or it may be too <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>Diſtinct</hi> on the other. And it is not ſo very eaſie to avoid both inconveniencies. The reaſon is, becauſe it ſhould be framed as all may in good earneſt uſe it, notwithſtanding the great Difference amongſt thoſe that are within the Communion of the Church; the Sins of ſome of them being more in <hi>number,</hi> and greater in <hi>kind,</hi> and more <hi>heinouſly aggravated,</hi> than the Sins of others.</p>
                        <p>There may be this Inconvenience in a Confeſſion <hi>very ſhort</hi> and <hi>General,</hi> that takes in all, that it does not ſo well <hi>ſerve</hi> to excite or to expreſs that due ſenſe of Sin, nor to exerciſe that humility and ſelf abaſement wherewith we ſhould always Confeſs our Sins to God. On the other hand, the Inconvenience of a <hi>very Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> and <hi>Diſtinct</hi> Confeſſion of Sins will be this, That ſome Sins, with their Aggravations, may be Confeſſed in the Name of the whole Congregation, of which it is by no means to be ſuppoſed that all are guilty; and then they who through the Grace of God have been kept from them, cannot in good earneſt make ſuch Confeſſion.</p>
                        <p>Now I take it, that the Confeſſions of Sin in the <hi>Daily</hi> and in the <hi>Communion Service,</hi> are ſo Judiciouſly framed as to avoid both extreams: Since the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have that large meaning as to take in the caſe of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:434"/> the beſt of the Congregation, who may in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt uſe them, and thereby joyn their Confeſſions with the reſt. And on the other ſide, though they are Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, yet they are ſo affectionately amplified, that they may well ſerve to expreſs that Contrition which they ought to feel who labour under the Conſcience of moſt hemous Sins; and, if they come duly prepared, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a godly ſorrow for Sin, and to exerciſe a due ſenſe of their own unworthineſs of Gods Mercy. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thoſe who are made to believe otherwiſe, that they would venture to uſe their own Judgment in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and upon this occaſion ſeriouſly to read over thoſe two Confeſſions in our <hi>Lyturgie;</hi> the one, that which our daily Worſhip almoſt begins with; the other, in the <hi>Communion Office</hi> before the <hi>Abſolution.</hi> And then let them judge impartially, as in the fear of God, if I have not ſaid the Truth.</p>
                        <p>But beſides this, the Confeſſion of Sin after the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter has recited each of the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> is not only General enough to take in all ſorts of Men; but it ſeems alſo to be as particular as can reaſonably be deſired in a Congregation, becauſe it goes particularly through the Ten Commandments, to which it has been uſual to reduce the whole Duty of Man. And this Method of Confeſſion makes it eaſie for all that conſider their own ways, and endeavour to underſtand their own ſtate, to confeſs every one of them to God, yet more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his known Offences in thought, word, or deed, againſt each Commandment.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things being well provided for, to find fault with this part of our Service, ſeems to argue want of Modeſty or Judgment in thoſe that do ſo. They ſeem to believe ours to be amiſs, becauſe they believe themſelves could make a better. But, if for this and ſuch like reaſons, they think fit to break Communion with us,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:434"/> where will be an end of <hi>Diviſion</hi> and <hi>Separation?</hi> I hope none of our Brethren will ſay, that they are not to make a Confeſſion of their Sins in a way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that is poſſible to be mended; leſt by this means they ſhould never make any Confeſſion of Sin at all: Since it may ſtill remain a Queſtion, Whether <hi>this</hi> had not been better left out, or <hi>that</hi> added, after the beſt care is taken. If a Form of Confeſſion of Sins were Compoſed by the wifeſt of them, I ſuppoſe he would pretend no more than that it is ſo Compoſed, that Gods People might ſafely and profitably uſe it. And this is that we may confidently ſay of the Confeſſions in our <hi>Liturgie;</hi> and if this be truly ſaid, it ought to end the Diſpute.</p>
                        <p>And yet they who Object the Generalneſs of our Confeſſions againſt us, would not find it an eaſie task to give us better and more unexceptionable. I may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, they would not mend the Matter, if they could prevail to have them as Particular as they are wont to be in the Prayers of ſome that ſeparate from us. For beſides that they Confeſs againſt themſelves ſo many particular Sins as many ſincere Chriſtians cannot in good earneſt acknowledge themſelves to be, or ever to have been guilty of, there is this other great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in ſuch Confeſſions, that groſs <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and other <hi>Carnal Profeſſors,</hi> are very apt to go away with an opinion, that their caſe is as good as that of the beſt; ſince by theſe Confeſſions of Sin, which deſcribe their own caſe perhaps truly enough, it ſhould ſeem that the reſt are no better than themſelves. We find it needful to warn thoſe of our own Communion againſt ſuch like miſtakes, though they are not in ſo much danger of falling into them. We are afraid leſt they that live in the Practice of wilful Sins, ſhould think the better of themſelves, becauſe we do all confeſs that we have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:435"/> 
                           <hi>erred and ſtrayed from Gods ways like lost ſheep, and have followed too much the devices and deſires of our own hearts, and have offended againſt the holy Laws</hi> of God, <hi>and have left undone thoſe things which we ought to have done, and have done thoſe things which we ought not to have done, and that manifold ſins and wickedneſs in thought, word, and deed, have moſt grievouſly been committed by us, against the Divine Majeſty, whereby we have provoked moſt juſtly his wrath and indignation againſt us.</hi> But 'tis not hard for us to ſhew theſe Men, that all this may be truly Confeſſed by the ſincere and godly, as well as by Hypocrites; that though the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion does not mention a difference, yet it does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that there is no difference between them, but after all, that theſe are in a ſtate of Impenitence &amp; Damnation, while thoſe are in a ſtate of Salvation, who yet truely confeſs their Sins in the ſame General Words with the reſt of the Congregation. But there is greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this ſelf-flattery we are ſpeaking of, where the Common Confeſſion of Sins is ſo very particular as ſome would have ours to be. And though there is <hi>greater need</hi> of Caution againſt it in ſuch places, yet the way of their Confeſſion makes the miſtake <hi>more difficult</hi> to be prevented.</p>
                        <p>Indeed we find in the Scripture Examples of Holy Men confeſſing ſuch Sins as themſelves were not guilty of. Thus did <hi>Jeremiah, Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> &amp;c. But this was upon Solemn Humiliation for thoſe known and publick Idolatries of the Nation, which had brought Gods heavy Judgments upon them, or for Common and Scandalous Tranſgreſſions afterward. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered themſelves as part of that Community which had provoked God to ſend them into Captivity, and therefore they bore their part in the Common Calamity with ſuch meekneſs, and confeſſed the Common Sins
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:435"/> with ſuch humility, as if themſelves had offended as greatly in their own Perſons as their Countrey-men had done. But I conceive there is a great deal of difference between thoſe Confeſſions of Sin, that ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſions of Publick Humiliation require, and thoſe that are fit for the ordinary Service of God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſtated Aſſemblies of the Church.</p>
                        <p>But it ought not to be forgot, that thoſe particular Confeſſions of Sin, which ſome Men want in our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie are not properly the matter of that Publick Service we are to offer daily unto God in <hi>Religious Aſſemblies,</hi> but of that Private Devotion which is neceſſary to be performed in our Cloſets. And if we could be perſuaded ſeriouſly to enter upon this Work of Examining our ſelves impartially concerning thoſe Sins which we have more openly or ſecretly committed, and then to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves before God for them, with particular Confeſſions and ſutable Prayer for his Grace and Pardon; we ſhould then find our Affections prepared to comply with thoſe more <hi>General</hi> Confeſſions of Sin, which we make with the whole Congregation; we ſhould then have leſs reaſon to complain, that thoſe Confeſſions are not apt to move us, becauſe this way would cure the <hi>deadneſs</hi> of <hi>our hearts,</hi> which commonly are moſt to blame, when we find fault with the means that God hath provided for us.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this Matter, There is great need of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Confeſſion of Sins in <hi>Religious Aſſemblies,</hi> but that of another ſort than what I have yet been ſpeaking of; and that is the particular and humble Confeſſion which every <hi>Scandalous</hi> Sinner ought to make in the <hi>Congregation,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of the Church, and the declaration of a true Repentance. This is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an Act of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but alas! al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt in this miſerably divided ſtate of the <hi>Church;</hi>
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:436"/> a loſs never enough to be lamented! For ſo it has fallen out, that by quarreling for a Reformation in things of an Indifferent Nature, that ought to be left to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Governours; and the Communion of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> is broken, and the Spiritual Authority which <hi>Chriſt</hi> left in his <hi>Church</hi> is expoſed to Contempt, which is a Matter of a thouſand times more concern, then all the Objections againſt the Book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though they were as conſiderable as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſeem to believe they are.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Objection I ſhall take notice of, is that againſt the <hi>ſhortneſs of the Collects,</hi> by reaſon of which it is pretended, that the Prayer is <hi>often ſuddenly broken off,</hi> and <hi>then begun again:</hi> And this is thought not ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Gravity wherewith this Duty ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> nor ſo likely a means of <hi>exciting Reverence</hi> and Devotion in the People, as <hi>one continued Form of Prayer</hi> that might be as long as all thoſe put together. Now in anſwer to this, I ſay,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the meer <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> of a Prayer, is not to be found fault with by any underſtanding <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> ſince this would be to diſparage that <hi>Form</hi> of Prayer which our <hi>Lord</hi> taught his Diſciples, it being not much longer than moſt of our <hi>Collects,</hi> and not ſo long as ſome of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it will be hard to prove, That <hi>many</hi> of theſe ſhort Prayers being offer'd up unto God one <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> after another, is either not ſo <hi>Grave</hi> or not ſo <hi>Edifying,</hi> as one <hi>Continued Form.</hi> I do not believe the difference to be ſo great, as it is made by thoſe that do not approve our way. For the <hi>Work of Praying</hi> is as much continued all the while, as if there were but one Continued Form. Indeed, in the Book the <hi>Printed</hi> Prayer breaks off ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what often, and there is a <hi>diſtinction</hi> made between the ſeveral <hi>Collects,</hi> by a New <hi>Title</hi> ſhewing the Matter of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:436"/> the Prayer, and by beginning a New Line. But I hope our Brethren do not mean, that in this there is a defect of Gravity, or any hindrance of Devotion and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the <hi>abruption</hi> of the <hi>Printed</hi> Forms is by no means an interruption of our Prayer; ſince we ſtill go on in Praying or in giving Thanks to God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking off, paſs from one Petition, or Matter of Invocation, to another, as immediately as if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Forms we uſe together were all brought into the Compaſs of One.</p>
                        <p>And as there is no Interruption of <hi>our Praying,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the frequent beginning and ending of the <hi>Collects;</hi> ſo neither can this cauſe an Interruption of <hi>Attention</hi> in the People, which is rather helped by that frequency of ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> which this way requires. Nor can it be charged with a tendency to Interrupt that <hi>Devout Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and <hi>Godly Diſpoſition</hi> of Mind, which is the beſt thing in Prayer: But on the other hand, this may be kept alive and more effectually ſecured, by calling upon the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and pleading the <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo often as we do. I know ſome have ſaid, this is done more frequently than is meet. But it would be a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing, if there ſhould be any difference about this Matter. When the Decence and Convenience of a thing is conſidered, we ſhould attribute much to the Wiſdom of Authority, and to the Judgment of Prudent and Holy Men, ſuch as our firſt Reformers were, and great numbers of Learned Perſons ſince their time were alſo, who thought this manner of Praying to be Grave and Edifying. And I believe others would be of the ſame Mind, if they would not altogether dwell upon their Prejudice againſt our way; but attend a little to thoſe conſiderations that favour it, and which diſcover the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and uſefulneſs of it; which ſort of Equity they that are Wiſe and Humble will ſhew to all Men, much more to their Governours.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:437"/>
                        <p>Now the Invocation of God ſomewhat often by his Attributes, does of it ſelf tend to maintain in our Minds a reverent ſenſe of his Majeſty and Preſence, which we all know is of neceſſary uſe to make us Pray unto him as we ought to do. I make no queſtion but thoſe that have been blamed for repeating <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> ſo very often in their <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers, would think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſomewhat hardly uſed, if they ſhould not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, in ſaying, that this was not for want of Matter, but for the exciting of a reverent ſenſe of Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in themſelves and others. And I think there is a little more reaſon why this Conſtruction ſhould be made of the frequent calling upon God by his Name and Perfections, in the Prayers of the Church.</p>
                        <p>In like manner the frequency of mentioning the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>Mediation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is profitable for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of our Faith and Aſſurance that we ſhall be heard. And to Pray unto God in the Name of Chriſt being the moſt diſtinguiſhing Character of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Devotion, This alſo will juſtifie our frequent uſe of it. And the reaſon is ſo much the ſtronger, becauſe this is one main thing that diſtinguiſheth us from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which pretendeth the Mediation of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Departed Saints,</hi> as well as of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And it had not been ſo agreeable to the Principles of the Reformation, to have left the Name and Mediation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of the Concluſion of any of the Collects, when this Church declared her deteſtation of calling upon God in any other Name, but the Name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is all I ſhall ſay to this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and I hope enough is ſaid to remove the Prejudice of all Sober and Underſtanding Perſons againſt the <hi>ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Collects, and againſt the recital of the Name or Attributes of <hi>God,</hi> and of the Name and Merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in every one of them.</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:437"/>
                        <p>The next Exception I ſhall take notice of, is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Repetition</hi> of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> in the Offices of the Liturgie, and of that Hymn, <hi>Glory be to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the Son, and to the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. and of that Petition, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> and the like.</p>
                        <p>Now I hope that they are but very few, and I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh they were none at all, that ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as to diſapprove all uſe of theſe Forms in our Worſhip: I do not mean of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> only, but of thoſe Affectionate Petitions, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, Chriſt have mercy upon us,</hi> and of that excellent <hi>Doxologie, Glory be to the Father,</hi> &amp;c. which moreover contains a ſhort Confeſſion of our Faith, in oppoſition to the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians.</hi> But that which is thought too much, is that theſe things are too often repeated, and that regard enough is not had to that Rule of our Saviour, <hi>When ye Pray uſe not vain Repetitions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I hope nothing of this will appear upon farther Examination. For by our Saviour's Caution againſt <hi>Vain</hi> Repetitions, it ſeems that there are ſome Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are <hi>not vain,</hi> and which therefore he doth not forbid. And this we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe, becauſe himſelf Praying in his <hi>Agony, thrice</hi> uſed the ſame Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in the <hi>ſame</hi> Words. Now the Vanity of this kind among the <hi>Heathens</hi> which our Saviour would have his Diſciples to avoid, ſeems to be that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition which proceeds from the Affectation of much ſpeaking in Prayer, or from a belief that God will not be moved to help us, unleſs we uſe many Words, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the ſame thing over in a tedious manner. And thus the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> cried out from Morning till Noon, <hi>O Baal hear us; O Baal hear us.</hi> We are far enough, I hope, from ſuch kind of Repetitions. And ſince they are ſuch tedious Repetitions as theſe, which our Saviour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:438"/> here calls Vain, Men ſhould have a care of calling thoſe Repetitions of Good Prayers and Praiſes Vain, which are nothing like theſe, eſpecially in contempt of a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Rule.</p>
                        <p>I never yet could find, that thoſe who charge our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> with this fault, have attempted to ſhew us thoſe marks of difference, by which we might diſtinguiſh Vain Repetitions from thoſe that are not Vain, which I think their pretence obliged them to do. But although the Gravity and Uſefulneſs of that part of our Service, which they make this Objection againſt, might well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us from any farther Vindication; yet I ſhall ſay ſomething to this purpoſe, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe that are willing to be ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>I conceive there are theſe two things only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in uſing Repetitions in Prayer or Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, that they may not be liable to the charge of Vanity.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Matter Repeated be very weighty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,</hi> and <hi>that it be ſingularly apt to move thoſe Pious Affections</hi> which God is moſt pleaſed with in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him. And in this reſpect I dare ſay there is no ſober Chriſtian but will grant our Repetitions to be ſecured from Vanity. Such Petitions as <hi>Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon us,</hi> deſerve the putting forth of the whole ſtrength of our Deſires and Affections. And when we aſcribe <hi>Glory to the Holy Trinity,</hi> we expreſs what we ought to make the end of all our Worſhip, and of all the Actions of our Lives. And therefore theſe things will bear being Repeated, and the Repetition of them may be profitable both to excite and to expreſs the fervour of our Minds. And I truſt we ſhall agree, that if any one Form of Prayer will bear being uſed more than once, when we Worſhip God, it is the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:438"/>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing required to ſecure Repetitions from Vanity, is, That they be <hi>framed with Judgment, both with regard to the frequency, that they do not come over too often, and with regard to the diſpoſal of them,</hi> that they come in <hi>fitly</hi> and in <hi>due place.</hi> I do not mean that this is ſo very nice a thing, that the difference of an hairs breadth, as we uſe to ſay, will ſpoil all: For in things of this Nature there is a Latitude in which Prudent Men may take their choice; but only that this is to be done with diſcretion and choice, and with reſpect to the Ends for which Repetitions may be uſeful. And I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this alſo is not wanting in our <hi>Liturgie.</hi> For I do not find that this was ever Objected againſt the Repetitions we mean, that they are ordered injudiciouſly, unleſs upon the only account of too much frequency. And yet the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> is but twice in the Ordinary Service, and but once in every other diſtinct Office of Prayer or Thankſgiving. The <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> is uſed but once at our beginning to Praiſe God with Spiritual <hi>Hymns,</hi> and once at the Concluſion of every Pſalm, and of ſome of the <hi>Hymns,</hi> beſides one recital thereof in the Litany, when that is uſed. And as for thoſe ſhort Ejaculations. <hi>Lord have mercy upon us; Chriſt have mercy upon us.</hi> The former is repeated but once in the Ordinary Service, and both but twice in the Litany. So that there is no ſuch ground of Complaint as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there are many Repetitions in our Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, much leſs that thoſe are Vain which are there. And I do not ſee how they that charge our Common-Prayer Book with Vain Repetitions upon theſe accounts, can have a reverent eſteem of the 136 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where for 26 Verſes together, <hi>His mercy endureth for ever,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in every Verſe.</p>
                        <p>There is indeed one thing more requiſite to ſecure our Repetitions of the ſame thing in calling upon God
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:439"/> from being Vain, and that is, That our Deſires and Affections ſhould be raiſed to keep pace with our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. But this belongs to us to take care of. And if we would endeavour to ſtir up in our ſelves that Zeal and Devotion of Heart, which ſhould anſwer that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof which theſe Repetitions make, this would ſatisfie us beyond all other Argument that they are not Vain. To Conclude this Matter, I deſire thoſe who do not yet approve our Repetition of the Lords Prayer, and the other ſhort Devotions, to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo eaſie to ſpend the time it takes up more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, than by joining in good earneſt with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in theſe Prayers.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, the <hi>Reſponſals</hi> of the <hi>Congregation</hi> are Matter of Offence to ſome Perſons; They do not approve the <hi>Peoples ſaying the Confeſſion and the Lords Prayer after the Miniſter,</hi> nor <hi>their alternate Reciting ſome Petitions in the daily Service,</hi> with the <hi>Pſalms and Hymns,</hi> and leaſt of all do they approve <hi>that part</hi> which the <hi>Congregation bears in the Prayers of the Litany.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now it were well, if they, who blame our Prayers upon this account, would conſider what has often been ſaid to ſhew the uſefulneſs of this way. Namely, That it is apt to <hi>check a wandring Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Attention;</hi> and withal, that it tends to <hi>quicken a lively Forwardneſs and Zeal in Gods Service,</hi> whilſt we <hi>invite and provoke one another</hi> to Pray and to give Thanks. Theſe things we ſay not without ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their Truth, and we think they carry plain Reaſon along with them, and I do not find that they have been Contradicted by the Leaders of the Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party. It is True, they have declared their diſlike of this way, but ſtill without taking notice of what may be ſaid for it. If I have obſerved right, the main Reaſon of their diſlike is this, That the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> as they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:439"/> ſay, <hi>is appointed for the people in all Publick Services ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to God,</hi> and that the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to be the Mouth of the People to God in Prayer.</hi> And therefore I ſhall Examine this Reaſon in the firſt place.</p>
                        <p>And, 1. If it were granted that the Scripture maketh the Miniſter to be the Mouth of the People to God in Publick Worſhip; yet this muſt by no means be ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, as to make all Vocal Prayer and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Religious Aſſemblies unlawful to the People. For then they muſt not declare their Aſſent to the Prayers which the Miniſter utters, by ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> which yet the Scripture approves, and is not diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any of thoſe that Object our way againſt us. Nor muſt it be ſo taken, as if the People were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from a Vocal Part in Praiſing God by <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs.</hi> For this alſo is warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſeems to be confeſſed by our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who allow the People to <hi>Sing Pſalms</hi> with the Miniſter.</p>
                        <p>Now he that audibly ſays <hi>Amen</hi> to the Prayers of the Congregation, makes a <hi>ſhort Reſponſal</hi> to the Miniſter: And moreover, they that ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in which there are Paſſages of Prayer, Confeſſions, or Petitions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining matter of Invocation proper for us, as the Pſalms often do, they pray Vocally. So that notwithſtanding what is pretended concerning the Miniſters being the Peoples Mouth to God, it ſhall ſtill be lawful for the People, ſometimes to joyn <hi>Vocally</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> as well as in Praiſe, and not only by ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> but by expreſſing the very words of <hi>Confeſſion</hi> or <hi>Petition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, <hi>2ly.</hi> Where is it ſaid in Scripture, that <hi>the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is the Mouth of the People to God,</hi> or that no Prayer may be Offered up to God <hi>in Religious Aſſemblies,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:440"/> than by the <hi>Mouth of the Miniſter?</hi> I doubt theſe ſayings are grown ſo ſamiliar amongſt ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they believe them to be the Words, or very near the Words of Scripture: But there are no ſuch <hi>Words</hi> nor <hi>meaning</hi> in the <hi>Bible</hi> that I can find, or that they have found for us. It is not good to pretend the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture for a Doctrine that is not to be met with there.</p>
                        <p>It is true that the Miniſter is the Mouth of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to God in all thoſe Prayers which he utters for them, and becauſe theſe are many more than what the People themſelves utter, he may be ſaid to be their Mouth to God <hi>Comparatively,</hi> but not <hi>Abſolutely.</hi> It will be true alſo, that the Miniſter is <hi>appointed for the People in all Publick Services appertaining to God,</hi> if this be underſtood for the <hi>moſt part,</hi> or of <hi>All</hi> with little exception. Some Publick Services there are which are incloſed in <hi>his Office,</hi> and he is appointed for them in <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the People;</hi> that is, for <hi>Adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Abſolving the Penitent,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing the People.</hi> And therefore Prayers that immediately concern theſe things are to be pronounced by him only. And as for the reſt, the <hi>Order</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of the Miniſterial Function, makes it fit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that the Miniſter ſhould utter <hi>moſt</hi> ever of them; &amp; that in thoſe wherein the People have their part, he ſhould ever <hi>go before,</hi> and <hi>lead</hi> them, and <hi>guide</hi> the whole performance: which is all taken care for in our <hi>Liturgie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſaid before, that the Diſſenters do not utterly debar the People from all Vocal Prayer and Thankſgiving of their own in God's Solemn Worſhip. And therefore it were great pity that they ſhould keep at a diſtance from us upon Queſtions of this Nature. And I heartily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to conſider whether they may not upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:440"/> their own Principles come up to the Rules and Cuſtoms of our Church in this thing.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If they grant the Peoples intereſt in Vocal Praiſe, let them conſider whether they have reaſon to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Peoples bearing a part in any of the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms</hi> by <hi>alternate Reſponſes.</hi> For the plain End of reciting thoſe Pſalms in the Congregation, is to Praiſe and Magnifie God's Name, and to excite in our Hearts ſuch like devout affections in doing ſo, as thoſe Holy Men felt in themſelves, who were aſſiſted by God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Compoſing them. And therefore the Diſſenters are not obliged to demand that the People be ſilent all this while. I have heard ſome of them ſay, that if theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> were <hi>Sung,</hi> the Congregation might then challenge to put in their Voices with the Miniſter. But when they are <hi>read,</hi> as they generally are in our Pariſh Churches, they ſay this ought to be the Work of the Miniſter only. But I cannot ſee why ſinging or not ſinging ſhould make ſuch a Difference. I grant it were better if they were every where ſung, becauſe this is more ſuitable to the Deſign of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> than bare <hi>reciting</hi> is. But if they be not ſung (which is cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily omitted in <hi>Pariſh</hi> Churches, for want of skill as I conceive) the next uſe of them that is moſt agreeable to their Nature and Deſign, is not that the Miniſter ſhould <hi>read all,</hi> as he does other parts of the Scripture; but that the <hi>People</hi> ſhould <hi>recite</hi> the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and other Godly <hi>Hymns,</hi> with the Miniſter by way of <hi>Anſwering in turns,</hi> as the Cuſtom is with us, more or leſs in moſt Places. For when the People riſe up to do this in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Solemn Praiſing of God, this is much nearer to ſinging, wherein the People are allowed to bear a part in God's Vocal Praiſe, than the Miniſters reciting all himſelf, and ſhutting out the People from any part thereof.</p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:441"/>
                        <p>But it is Objected particularly againſt the reciting of <hi>one</hi> Verſe of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> by the Miniſter, and <hi>another</hi> by the People; that the Peoples Verſe is in a manner loſt to ſome of the Congregation, ſince in the <hi>confuſed murmur of ſo many Voices nothing can be diſtinctly heard.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if our Brethren ſhould admit of what has been already ſaid in Vindication of theſe Reſponſals; I hope this Objection will not be inſiſted upon. I grant, that which is uttered in the Congregation ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. But then thoſe Verſes of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> which are uttered by the Congregation may be well enough underſtood by every one that has a Book, or who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted competently well with the <hi>Pſalms</hi> themſelves. I need not ſay much in anſwer to this Objection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be removed by every one that makes it, if he can read, and will bring a Book along with him. And as for thoſe that cannot, I muſt needs ſay, that it is not ſo hard as is pretended for them alſo to take thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are uttered by thoſe that are near them, if they will carefully attend. And I have been credibly informed, that ſome devout People that <hi>could never read,</hi> have attained to an ability of reciting moſt of the Pſalms without Book, by often hearing them in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where they are <hi>alternately recited;</hi> which ſhews that the <hi>Murmur</hi> is not ſo <hi>confuſed,</hi> but that the Words may be heard ditinctly enough to be underſtood, if one has a mind to it. And then they that cannot read may by this means be more quickned, than otherwiſe they would be, to learn to read; however to attend, and to learn the Pſalms without Book, that they alſo may bear their part <hi>Vocally</hi> with the Congregation in God's Praiſes.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall add, That for the moſt part the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited alternately in thoſe Churches only, where it may be reaſonably preſumed that the whole Congregation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:441"/> can read, very few excepted. For by the way, this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of reading the Pſalms is not Commanded, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pariſh Church is left at liberty to obſerve her own Cuſtom about it. In the <hi>Country</hi> Pariſhes the Miniſter generally recites all, (which way I do not think ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient as that of <hi>Reſponſals,</hi> for the Reaſon I gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.) But there ought to be no breach amongſt us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things of this Nature, in which one way may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be more convenient in one reſpect, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary more convenient in another; and then we ſhould not altogether dwell upon Conſiderations that favour our own opinion, but attend alſo to thoſe that may be offered for another, and put the beſt conſtruction upon it, eſpecially in favour of a Publick Rule, or a received Cuſtom. This is more <hi>Chriſtian-like,</hi> and will be more for the honour of Religion, and the good of other Mens Souls, and for our own Comfort at laſt, than to ſtrain our utmoſt Wit to find faults with, and to aggravate Inconveniences againſt the Laws or Uſages of the Church where we live. This that I am now ſpeaking of is not a <hi>Law</hi> impoſed on all the Churches of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Communion, but a <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of ſome of them, which I thought good to deſend, that they who think not ſo highly well of it as I do, may not yet break Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thoſe that uſe it. And I hope our Brethren, who grant the People are not to be excluded from Vocal Praiſe, will conſider that there is no inconvenience in uttering the <hi>Pſalms</hi> by <hi>Reſponſals,</hi> but that which is pretended concerning the difficulty to underſtand what is ſaid: And that there is very little reaſon for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſeeing the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are the moſt <hi>known</hi> parts in the <hi>Bible,</hi> and that if thoſe few who cannot read, will be careful, they may reap great benefit by attending to the Congregation, as ſome have done, till themſelves have been able to recite the Pſalms.</p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:442"/>
                        <p n="2">2. If they grant it Lawful and Expedient, that the People ſhould joyn in Vocal <hi>Praiſe;</hi> I cannot ſee how they can Diſpute the lawfulneſs or expedience of their joyning with the Miniſter ſometimes in Vocal <hi>Prayer.</hi> It will not be eaſie to ſhew a Reaſon why this ſhould be diſallowed, if that be allowed. If it be ſaid, there is ſome Example and Warrant in the Scripture for the one, but not for the other; it ſeems to be a good anſwer, that there is ſuch a parity of reaſon, as that the expreſs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Scripture for one, is an implied warrant for the other: Unleſs a Man will ſay, that <hi>Nothing muſt be done in Gods Worſhip for which there is not expreſs and particular Warrant;</hi> which though a Man may ſay when he is oppoſing a way of Worſhip which he likes not, yet he will not ſay it, when he comes to defend his own. It is a Principle that no Man will ſtand by, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he may take it up to ſerve a turn. The truth is, the Scripture does not pretend to give us a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Order and Manner of the Solemn Worſhip of God either in the <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or in the <hi>Churches of Chriſtians;</hi> nor to preſcribe a Form for the Service of God by the Church in after times. Several things were done in the <hi>Religious Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> firſt of all, that were peculiar to the extraordinary effuſion of the Spirit in thoſe times, and ſeveral that were fit enough for the conduct of God's Service when Miracles ſhould ceaſe; and of both ſorts <hi>ſome</hi> are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s two Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> but no Man that underſtands theſe things will ſay, that they are all intimated there, or any where elſe in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And therefore it does not follow that they did not obſerve in their Worſhip, this or that Cuſtom; from hence, that we do not find it written that they obſerved it. We do not read that the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> was uſed in the time of the Apoſtles; but I ſuppoſe they are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:442"/> very few who will therefore make a queſtion whether it was uſed or not. We are able to ſhew that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples joyning in Vocal Prayer with the Miniſter was very anciently practiſed. In imitation of the way of the Chriſtians, <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> appointed a Form of Prayer for the <hi>Heathen,</hi> to be recited in Parts; which ſhews that this was a known Cuſtom <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Naz. Orat.</hi> 3.</note> of the Church in thoſe days, and that it had been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally practiſed before. And if this was the Primitive way, it is more probable that it was the way in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time,</hi> than that it was not. But of this let every one Judge as he ſees cauſe. This is certain, That the Apoſtles left the Governours of the Church under the Obligation of ordering the Service of God according to General Rules, and preſcribed that all things ſhould be done Decently and in Order, and to Edification. And I do not think that our Brethren will ever be able to ſhew, that this Practice which they except againſt, is not agreeable to ſuch General Rules; which yet they ought to do very fully and plainly, to excuſe their Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
                        <p>That which is moſt urged, is, That the People ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in the Church is <hi>Diſorderly,</hi> and a breaking in upon the Miniſters Office. But will they ſay that the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> intrenched upon the Prieſt, when they <hi>all bowed themſelves upon the Pavement, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Lord, and Praiſed him, ſaying, For he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever;</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 3.? I have already obſerved, That Eccleſiaſtical Order is in this matter ſecured by the Miniſters <hi>Preſiding</hi> in God's Publick Worſhip, and <hi>guiding</hi> the whole performance of it.</p>
                        <p>But not to allow the People to make an <hi>audible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sin</hi> after the Miniſter, nor to <hi>utter ſome few affectionate Petitions,</hi> and thoſe very ſhort, to which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:443"/> they are alſo <hi>invited</hi> and <hi>led</hi> by him; this rather ſeems to ſavour of an affectation of undue ſuperiority over the People, than to proceed from any fear, leſt by this means they ſhould be <hi>incouraged to invade the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office.</hi> I believe the <hi>Laity</hi> of our Communion have as Reverend an eſteem of the Sacred Function as their Neighbours, and to raiſe the Compariſon no higher, have ſhewn themſelves ever ſince the Reformation, as much afraid to uſurp the <hi>proper Offices</hi> of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> as thoſe that have been drawn away from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, and have been taught that they muſt not ſay a word in Publick Prayer, but <hi>Amen.</hi> We ſhould not think that we endanger our Order and the reſpect that is due to it, if we do not arrogate more to our ſelves than is meet. It has been one great fault of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to advance the <hi>Prieſt</hi> unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably above the <hi>People</hi> in the Adminiſtration of Holy Things. The Diſſenting Miniſters may be a little guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this, though in a particular wherein that Church is not guilty of it. They ſeem to make too little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Flock of Chriſt,</hi> in Condemning our Church for permitting and requiring the People to Offer up thoſe Petitions to God with their <hi>own Mouths,</hi> which are appointed for them in the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> The Miniſter aſſuming the whole to himſelf does not indeed make <hi>him much greater</hi> in the Church than he is, but they that obſtinately deny any part of it to the People, do make <hi>them</hi> of <hi>much lower and meaner Condition</hi> in the Church than they ought to be. And it is ſomething ſtrange, that thoſe very Perſons who Contend for the intereſt of the <hi>Laity</hi> in ſome buſineſs in <hi>Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> that more nearly touches upon <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> than the bare offering up of a few Petitions to God, ſhould be ſo unwilling to allow them this. They affirm that the People have a right to be heard before
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:443"/> 
                           <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> are <hi>Ordained,</hi> and as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them contend to interpoſe alſo in all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Diſcipline:</hi> and yet they do not think them qualified to bear any part in the Prayers of the Congregation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to what the Miniſter utters. Theſe things do not ſeem to hang well together. And I am perſuaded our Church has ordered this Matter with more Judgment and Impartiality, in aſſigning to the People their Intereſt both in Acts of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> within ſuch Rules and Limits that the <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> may know what their proper place and buſineſs is in all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have heard ſome Object againſt the Peoples utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Prayers and Praiſes in the Congregation, that it is <hi>Forbidden Women to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> But this is ſtrangely miſapplied to the Matter in hand. For it is plain, that the ſpeaking mentioned by the Apoſtle, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing but <hi>Prophecying, Interpreting, Preaching,</hi> or <hi>Inſtructing;</hi> and that the reaſon why he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this to the Woman, is becauſe Preaching is an <hi>Act</hi> that implies <hi>Authority,</hi> whereas the Womans part is <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Subjection.</hi> They that will read the whole Chapter, will find that this is the true meaning of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And indeed the place it ſelf ſufficiently ſhews it, which I ſhall therefore ſet down. <hi>Let your Women keep ſilence in the Churches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak, but they are Commanded to be under Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as alſo the Law ſaith. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at home, for it is a ſhame for a Woman to ſpeak in the Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34, 35, The Subject of this Diſcourſe is briefly expreſt in the 39 Verſe, <hi>Brethren covet to prophecy, and forbid not to ſpeak with tongues.</hi> Now the reaſon given why the Woman is not to ſpeak, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe ſhe is to be <hi>under Obedience,</hi> does plainly reſtrain <hi>that Speaking</hi> to <hi>Prophecying,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:444"/> the like, which is moreover the only ſort of <hi>Speaking</hi> that is diſcourſed of in this place.</p>
                        <p>I know no particular Exception under this Head which remains to be ſpoken to, unleſs it be, that the People are ſaid to utter the <hi>Words of Invocation in the Litany for the moſt part,</hi> the Miniſter all the while <hi>ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting the Matter of it to them.</hi> But this Objectin will be of no force, if what I have ſaid concerning the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of allowing the People an Intereſt in <hi>Vocal Prayer</hi> be admitted; unleſs the Objection be this, That they are allowed to bear <hi>too conſiderable a part</hi> in that Prayer, and ſomewhat to the diſparagement of the Miniſters Office. And then I anſwer, That, upon Reaſons which I ſhall preſently Offer, it ſeems to me to be otherwiſe. I ſhall only premiſe that I am really troubled for their ſakes who put us upon this Defence, that in Matters of Prudence and Expedience wherein there is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble latitude to order them well enough, that in theſe things I ſay they ſeem to yield ſo very little to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Judgment of their Governours. I do not think it hard to make out the Prudence of theſe Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſo much diſliked: This is not the thing I am troubled at. But I think it hard that a <hi>Publick Rule</hi> ſhould not be thought reaſon enough to juſtifie things of this ſort, and to oblige the People to compliance without more adoe. I am ſorry that our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do not conſider that it is ſome diminution to their Modeſty and Humility, to challenge, as in effect they do, a nice and punctual account of the prudence of the Publick Orders of this Church, before they will Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to 'em in Practice. Now as to the Objection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. The Peoples Vocal Part in the Litany ſeems to be no diſparagement at all to the Miniſters Office upon theſe accounts.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:444"/>
                        <p n="1">1. Although the Formal Words, of <hi>Good Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us,</hi> and <hi>We beſeech thee to hear us Good Lord,</hi> be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the People; yet it muſt be acknowledged that this is but <hi>part</hi> of the Prayer of the Litany, that which the Miniſter utters being the <hi>other part</hi> and the <hi>far greater</hi> part.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Words of <hi>Prayer</hi> are <hi>begun</hi> by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, not only in the Invocation of the Holy Trinity firſt of all; but in that Prayer <hi>Remember not Lord our Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>Spare us Good Lord,</hi> and <hi>We beſeech thee O Lord God,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Miniſter does utter the <hi>Formal</hi> Words of Prayer, and the People take them all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from him, excepting only the Words of that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. They are but theſe two ſhort and known Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Good Lord deliver us,</hi> and <hi>We beſeech thee to hear us Good Lord,</hi> upon the uttering of which by the People the weight of the Objection lies. And if they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the People any Vocal part in the Words of Prayer, I know not what Petitions are more proper for them than ſuch as theſe. As for the <hi>Repetition</hi> of them, there is this reaſon for it, that there is ſtill new and diſtinct Matter to which they are applied. And I will be bold to ſay, that the repeated application of them is a great relief to attention and minding the buſineſs we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and evidently contributes to keep up an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ardent frame of Heart, in deſiring thoſe weighty things we ask of God in this Prayer. I could almoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the keeneſt of our Adverſaries, if that Petition, <hi>Good Lord deliver us,</hi> were applied but once in groſs to the <hi>Deprecations</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> of that part of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany</hi> to which it belongs, whether we ſhould not be more apt to let our attention fall, and to forget the meaning, and to languiſh in the offering up of thoſe Prayers, than as it is now ordered. But,</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:445"/>
                        <p n="4">4. I think it is plain, that in offering up theſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, the Miniſter has the <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Guiding</hi> part, in that he utters all the <hi>diſtinct Matter</hi> of the Prayer, which the People do not, whereas he utters Words of <hi>Invocation</hi> as well as they. And now I deſire our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to conſider, whether if the People were to utter that which is the Miniſters part now; and the Miniſter to ſay that only which is theirs, they would not have more grievouſly complained that the Miniſters Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was ſlighted in the whole deſign, ſince he ſeemed only to learn from the People what the Congregation was to pray for.</p>
                        <p>It is of great Conſequence with what Mind we come to conſider any thing; if with prejudice and diſlike, we are then ready to turn all that is reaſonably produced in favour for it, into an argument of diſtaſte; and that ſeems unreaſonable, with the quite contrary, to which we ſhould have been more diſpleas'd if this had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the other. But ſurely we may judge of theſe things with <hi>Impartiality,</hi> and if need be with <hi>Candor,</hi> as we ought to do. And if the difficulty of doing ſo be ſeen in the frequency of doing the Contrary, even amongſt Men otherwiſe good, we have the greater need to intreat of God to enlighten our Underſtandings, and to reſcue us from prejudices and paſſions in the Judgment we make of all things of this nature. I do not intimate this any way in affectation of ſeeming not to need this exhortation my ſelf; but remembring my own frailty. I do hereupon admoniſh my ſelf as well as others. In the mean time, if there be any Biaſs upon my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that eſteem, I declare my ſelf to have of the Prayers of the Church; I muſt confeſs that I believe my ſelf to be byaſs'd on the right hand. For I take it to be much more for the <hi>ſafety of my own Soul,</hi> as well as the <hi>ſecurity of the Churches Peace,</hi> that I ſhould be inclined
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:445"/> rather to Judge too favourably of Publick Rules, than to value them beneath their juſt worth and uſefulneſs. But I muſt confeſs, That of all the Prayers in our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> that are of Humane Compoſition, I ſhould be moſt unwilling to part with the <hi>Litany</hi> as it now ſtands there. It ſeems to be, what it was deſigned to be, a Form of Prayer apt to excite our moſt <hi>intenſe</hi> and <hi>ſervent</hi> deſires of God's Grace and Mercy. Whileſt the Miniſter leads the people to pray againſt thoſe ſeveral Sins and Evils which a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is moſt concerned to be afraid of, and at the end of every convenient period, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation with one voice cries out, <hi>Good Lord deliver us;</hi> while the Miniſter leads them to pray for all thoſe particular Bleſſings which ought to be moſt dear to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the whole Congregation with one voice cries out, <hi>We beſeech thee to hear us Good Lord.</hi> Theſe Prayers ſeem to be offered with ſuch affection, as I am not well able to expreſs by any ordinary inſtance: In Offering them we ſeem to be as paſſionately concerned as a Malefactor upon his knees, that begs his own life. The whole Office is framed with reſpect both to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and contrivance, for the raiſing of the utmoſt Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Chriſtians, and for the warming of the coldeſt hearts by the heat of the Congregation. And in ſuch a diſpoſition it is then moſt fit to expreſs our Charity, by praying for others, even all ſorts of Men, as diſtinctly and particularly as Publick Prayers will bear. And this the fullneſs of this Prayer doth admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably provide for, as no Man will deny, who conſiders it without averſion and prejudice againſt it, which I pray God deliver all well meaning people from, that they may not deprive themſelves of ſo great a benefit.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall ſay no more concerning this Matter of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples joyning in Vocal Prayer and Praiſe. And indeed the Reaſon why I have dwelt ſo long upon an Anſwer
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:446"/> to this Objection, is, becauſe I have obſerved, that ſome <hi>honeſt</hi> perſons are very confident, that in this thing at leaſt our <hi>Liturgie</hi> is to be blamed. And I hope what hath been ſaid will to ſuch perſons give reaſonable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that for this thing it is rather to be commended. But becauſe upon this occaſion the part of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the <hi>Litany</hi> was laſt mentioned: I ſhall now ſpeak briefly to ſome other Objections againſt the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which are commonly made.</p>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe is, That we pray to be <hi>delivered from all deadly ſin,</hi> which ſeems to imply that there are ſome Sins which are not deadly.</p>
                        <p>Now in anſwer to this it is by ſome truly enough ſaid, That theſe Words do not neceſſarily imply a diſtinction between Sins that <hi>are,</hi> and Sins that <hi>are not deadly.</hi> But admitting that ſuch a diſtinction was intended, yet I think no underſtanding <hi>Chriſtian</hi> has reaſon to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with it. By <hi>Deadly Sin</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> means all ſuch Sin as puts a Man out of a ſtate of Favour with God. But all Sins are not thus Deadly. <hi>For in many things we offend all,</hi> and as for thoſe Sins which the Regenerate commit through Humane Frailty only, they are not thereby put into a ſtate of Damnation. And though all Sin be in its own Nature Deadly or Damnable; yet through the Mercy of God, and the Merits of Chriſt, Sins of meer Infirmity are not imputed to true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and therefore not Deadly to them. But there are ſome Sins ſo heinous, that he who Commits them is thereby put into a Damnable ſtate, and till he recovers himſelf by true Repentance and Actual Reformation, he cannot upon any good ground promiſe to himſelf that the <hi>wrath of God does not abide upon him.</hi> And 'tis of ſuch Sins as theſe that this paſſage is to be underſtood, as appears by Deadly Sin being added to <hi>Fornication. From Fornication and all other Deadly Sin, Good Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi>
                           <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:446"/> 
                           <hi>us.</hi> So that this Petition ſeems to be of the ſame Nature with that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt. Keep back thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant alſo from preſumptuous ſins, let not them have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me, then ſhall I be upright, and I ſhall be innocent from the great Tranſgreſſion, Pſal.</hi> 19. 13. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Words of the <hi>Litany</hi> ſeem to ſuppoſe that ſome Sins are not Deadly, we ſhould be very unjuſt to make ſuch a Conſtruction of them, as if they implyed that ſome Sins are <hi>in their own nature Venial,</hi> and ſo ſlight, that they will be forgiven without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for as I have ſhewn, we may hold that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which the Words ſuppoſe, and yet retain that <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine, that no Sin is forgiven, but through the <hi>Mercy of God,</hi> and the <hi>Merits and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, ſome are offended with our praying againſt <hi>Sudden Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But why ſhould we not by Sudden Death underſtand our being taken out of this World when we are not fit to die? For ſometimes a thing is ſaid to be Sudden to us when we are not prepared for it. And in this ſenſe can any good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> find fault with the Petition? But ſuppoſe, that by <hi>Sudden Death</hi> we mean what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood by it, that is, a Death of which a Man has not the leaſt warning by Sickneſs: Are there not reaſons why even good Men may deſire not to die ſuddenly? May they not when they find themſelves drawing towards their end, by their good Inſtructions and Admonitions make impreſſion upon their Friends, Companions, and Relations to the bettering of them? May not their Counſels be more effectual with them than ever they were before? And is it not reaſonable to believe they will be ſo? As for themſelves, may not the warning they have of Approaching Death be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make them more fit to die than they were in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:447"/> their perfect health? In a Word, he that thinks himſelf to have ſufficiently <hi>perfected holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> and not to ſtand in need of thoſe Acts of Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Humiliation, and Devotion, by which good Men improve the warnings of Death, which Mortal Sickneſs or Extream Age gives them, let him ſuſpend his Act, and refuſe to joyn with us when we pray God to <hi>deliver us from Sudden Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is yet another Objection which I ſhould not have named, but that ſome of the Diſſenters, who ſeem to underſtand very little of Religion by making it, have it often in their Mouths. That is, when we pray to be <hi>delivered by the Myſtery of Chriſts Holy Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by his Agony and Bloody Sweat, by his Croſs and Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> They ſay, ſome of them, that this is <hi>Swearing,</hi> ſome that it is <hi>Conjuring,</hi> and I know not what. For which ſayings, favouring of great profaneneſs, they ought to be ſeverely rebuked; and that is all the anſwer they ſhould have, were it not that ſome of them may be groſly ignorant of the true Senſe of theſe Petitions.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I ſay, that they might eaſily ſuppoſe, if they would give their Minds to it, that we pray to be delivered through the Saving Efficacy of <hi>Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. And yet I do not take this to be the principal meaning, or that which was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For I conceive that to be this, that when we ſay, <hi>By the Myſtery of thy Holy Incarnation,</hi> and <hi>by thy Croſs and Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Good Lord deliver us;</hi> we implore Chriſt, who has already ſhewed ſuch ineſtimable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us, by taking our Nature to his Divinity, to <hi>Die upon the Croſs,</hi> to be <hi>Buryed,</hi> to <hi>Riſe again,</hi> to <hi>aſcend into Heaven,</hi> and there to <hi>intercede with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for us,</hi> and by <hi>ſending the Holy Ghoſt</hi> to qualifie the Apoſtles for their great Work of carrying the Word
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:447"/> of Salvation into the World: I ſay we implore him who hath already done ſuch mighty things for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we plead with him by that goodneſs which he hath already given us ſuch great demonſtrations of, by thoſe wonders of Mercy that he hath wrought for us, that he would now go on to deliver us by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Grace from theſe Evils which we pray againſt. And this is ſo reaſonable, ſo devout and affectionate, ſo humble and thankful a way of Praying, that I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that any who call themſelves Believers ſhould be ſo ignorant as not to underſtand it, or ſo profane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like what they pretend to be, as to deride it. Though God does not need to be put in mind of his former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits towards us; yet it is fit for us to mention them in our moſt earneſt Prayers, not only becauſe we are to make a grateful acknowledgment of them to him, but likewiſe, becauſe by this means we encourage our ſelves to ask in Faith; ſince he who unaskt hath done ſuch great things for us, will not fail upon our earneſt and humble prayer, which himſelf alſo hath required, to give us all other good things that we need, and to deliver us from all real evils of which we are in danger.</p>
                        <p>I proceed next to conſider whether there be any juſt cauſe to find fault with the reading of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Leſſons in our Church.</p>
                        <p>And, 1. It muſt be acknowledged by thoſe who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the uſefulneſs of <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Catechiſing</hi> in the Church, that thoſe Chapters may be read in the Church, though they are not Divinely inſpired Writings, ſince no ſober Man will pretend that the Miniſter <hi>Preaches</hi> or <hi>Catechiſes</hi> by <hi>Inſpiration.</hi> But if other good Inſtructions may be read or recited in the Church, beſides the Word of God it ſelf, why may not ſome Leſſons out of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books be read, which contain excellent Rules of good Life; and Exhortations and Encouragements to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:448"/> Virtue and Piety; eſpecially ſince thoſe writings were greatly eſteemed by the Church in its pureſt Ages, when they and other Humane Writings were alſo Publickly read, as well as the Holy Scriptures?</p>
                        <p>2. If it be ſaid that thoſe Chapters of <hi>Canonical</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which are omitted in the <hi>Calendar,</hi> would be more profitably read inſtead of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Chapters; it ought alſo to be obſerved, that the Chapters omitted are thoſe of the Old Teſtament, which either recite Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, or the Rules of the Levitical Service, or which relate matters of Fact delivered alſo in other Chapters that are read, or which are hard to be underſtood. This ſeems to Apologiſe for the Churches leaving thoſe to be conſidered at home by them that have ability ſo to do, and appointing ſome <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Chapters to be read, which are more plain, and in that reſpect more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Common People: Unleſs a Man will ſay, that becauſe the Scripture is all of Divine Authority, it muſt be always more profitable to read any part of that to the people, than to uſe any other Exhortation, or read any other good Leſſon. And then I do not know what place will be left for Sermons, ſince as I ſaid before, they are no more of Divine Authority, than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Leſſons.</p>
                        <p>3. If it be ſaid, that the reading of theſe as Leſſons; is a <hi>prevailing Temptation</hi> to the Vulgar to take them for God's Word, or to think them equal to the Writings of the Old and New Teſtament: I believe there is no ſufficient ground for this. I never heard of any of our Communion that were led into that miſtake. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that our Church declareth thoſe Leſſons to be no part of Canonical Scripture, and in the <hi>6th</hi> Article ſaith, That they are <hi>read for example of Life, and inſtruction of Manners, but that it doth not apply them to eſtabliſh any Doctrine:</hi> And herein ſhe follows the Judgment and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:448"/> Practice of the Primitive Church, which diſtinguiſheth between the <hi>Canonical</hi> and <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, eſteeming thoſe to be of Divine Authority, theſe not ſo, but indeed Godly Writings, profitable to be publickly read. And why the ſame uſe of them may not be retained with the ſame diſtinction, I can ſee no good Reaſon. For the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> receiving the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books into her <hi>Canon,</hi> is not likely to miſlead any of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; ſince we are not ſo forward to take their Opinion in any Matter of Religion.</p>
                        <p>But in the laſt place, There is no <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Leſſon read in our Churches upon any <hi>Lords day</hi> in the year, and ſo there is not this pretence againſt Communion with us upon the <hi>Lords days,</hi> when it is that we do ſo earneſtly deſire the Communion of thoſe that have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from us. And therefore I ſhall at preſent ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thoſe Exceptions which are taken from the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of ſome of the <hi>Apocryphal Books,</hi> as that ſome Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are pretended to be <hi>Fabulous,</hi> &amp;c. For this would engage me to a greater length than I intend. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thinks himſelf capable to judge of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, may receive ſatisfaction from what Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi> has ſaid upon it in his <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſt.</hi> p. 164, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>To proceed; Although the <hi>Communion Service</hi> for the Gravity and Holineſs thereof is preferred by the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before all other Offices in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> yet that has not paſt free from Exception. The Paſſages that ſeem to be diſliked are two.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Petition in the Prayer before Conſecration, <hi>That our ſinful Bodies may be made clean by his Body, and our Souls waſhed by his moſt precious Blood.</hi> Here they ſay a diſtinct efficacy of cleanſing, and a greater efficacy is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Blood of Chriſt, than to his Body; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the cleanſing of our Souls is attributed to the Blood of Chriſt, whereas our Bodies are ſaid only to be cleanſed by his Body.</p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:449"/>
                        <p>Now in anſwer to this, I ſuppoſe it is plain from thoſe Words at the delivery of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine; The Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which was given for thee, preſerve thy Body and Soul unto everlaſting life. And the Blood of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. It is, I ſay, plain from hence, that our Church teaches the Sanctification and Salvation of our Souls and Bodies, to flow from the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the <hi>Blood of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore that former Paſſage is not to be Interpreted, as if our Souls were not cleanſed by the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they are ſaid to be waſhed by his Blood. For the ſaying of this does not exclude the other. When the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>We being many are one Bread and one Body, for we are all partakers of that one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 17. Though he expreſt only the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> yet no man will ſay he meant to exclude the <hi>Cup,</hi> as if the Unity of the Church would be argued only from their partaking in that one kind. And when he ſaid, <hi>that we have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. he meant not to exclude the Participation of the <hi>Bread,</hi> as if that <hi>one Spirit</hi> which animated the Church, was ſignified only by partaking of the Cup. Nor will any Man argue from hence, that he attributes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct efficacy to the Bread to prove the Unity of the Body, and to the Cup to prove the Unity of the Spirit. I muſt needs ſay, that this Exception was ſought, but never offered it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Miniſters delivering the Elements into every Communicants hands, with a Form of Words recited to every one of them at the Diſtribution, is blamed alſo, as being thought a departure from the Practice of Chriſt at the firſt Inſtitution of this Sacrament. For they ſay, our Lord's Words were, <hi>Take ye, Eat ye, Drink ye all of this,</hi> and therefore the People are not to take the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one by one out of the Miniſters hand, nor ought any Form of Words to be uſed particularly to every one that receives. To this I anſwer,</p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:449"/>
                        <p n="1">1. That it does not appear from thoſe Words, <hi>Take ye,</hi> &amp;c. which are ſpoken in the Plural Number, that our Saviour did not ſpeak particularly to every one of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles when they received, or that he did not deliver the Elements into every particular Mans hand. For the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> may well be ſuppoſed to give a ſhort account of the Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not of every Word he then ſaid, but what was neceſſary to be related. And then what might be particularly ſaid or done to every one, would be ſufficiently related, in being related as ſpoken or done Generally to all. That is, if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Take thou, Eat thou,</hi> to every one of them; this were truly related by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> who tell us that he had ſaid to all, <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I do not ſee how it can be proved, that our Practice varies from this <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of the Inſtitution: Tho, if it did, I ſuppoſe it might be as eaſily defended, as the Celebration of the Euchariſt about Dinner time, and not at Supper, which the Diſſenters themſelves ſcruple not. But he that thinks not this Anſwer ſufficient, let him conſult the aforeſaid excellent Book of Dr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> p. 218, &amp;c. where he ſhall find, that it is indeed more probable that our way is agreeable to the way of the Firſt Inſtitution in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than that which the Diſſenters would have inſtead of it. But for their ſakes who may not have that Book by them, I ſhall add out of it, another anſwer which I think may ſatisfie a Reaſonable Man. Suppoſing then that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> did not relate the Matter <hi>Summarily,</hi> but as diſtinctly as the Words were ſpoken by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Yet,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <q>Our Saviour alſo Commanded his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: But will any Chriſtian think it hence deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That where divers Perſons, or great numbers are to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:450"/> be Baptized together, the Solemn Words of Baptizing them <hi>in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> may not lawfully be expreſſed ſeverally to every Perſon? And if the Baptiſmal Form of Words may be Solemnly and Suitably to that Sacrament applied to every Perſon Baptized, by the General acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Chriſtians, there can be no Reaſon why the like may not be allowed in the Lord's Supper. Wherefore the Practice of our Church herein is no way <hi>unſuitable to the Inſtitution of Chriſt,</hi> or the Nature of the Sacrament; and the Alteration of it would be for the worſe, and to the abating the Solemnity of its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, <hi>Lib. Eccl. p.</hi> 224.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>There remains but two more particular Exceptions which I think needful to take notice of, and thoſe are in the Office of Baptiſm. And the firſt I mean, is,</p>
                        <p>1. That all Baptized Infants are ſuppoſed to be Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; of which, as ſome ſay, we cannot be certain.</p>
                        <p>But I deſire thoſe that ſay ſo, to conſider if the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> does not attribute to Baptiſm, as much as the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> does. We are ſaid by Baptiſm to be made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's Body, <hi>By one Spirit we are all Baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. And <hi>to be Baptized into Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>to put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 27. and <hi>he that is in Chriſt is a new creature.</hi> And to be <hi>Baptized for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 2. 38. Baptiſm is alſo called <hi>the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. Now if it be made a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether Infants are <hi>Regenerated</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> the Queſtion at laſt muſt come to this: Whether they are Qualified to become <hi>Members of Chriſts Body,</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into God's <hi>Covenant,</hi> to receive Pardon of <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Sin, and to become <hi>New Creatures,</hi> gaining that State by <hi>Grace,</hi> which they could not have by <hi>Nature?</hi> And I do not ſee, that any but <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> can deny this. For they that contend, as we do, that Infants are capable of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:450"/> 
                           <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> muſt not deny them to be qualified for this <hi>Grace</hi> of Baptiſm, unleſs they will make the Ordinance and Promiſes of God to be of none effect towards them. Now if Infants do by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> gain <hi>Remiſſion of Sin,</hi> and are made <hi>Members of Chriſt;</hi> they are <hi>Regenerated</hi> and <hi>Born anew.</hi> If they do not gain this by it, what does their Baptiſm ſignifie? Or what benefit can they be ſuppoſed to have by it, if they die in their Infancy, more than if they had not been Baptiz'd at all? This is the only means of Salvation they can have. And thoſe expreſſions of the Scripture above recited, with many more, will juſtifie our Church, which ſuppoſes that this means will be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, ſo long as they are capable of none other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be conſidered by thoſe that make it to be of none effect.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall only add, That this had been thought a ſtrange Queſtion in the Ancient Church, Whether Infants were <hi>Regenerated by Baptiſm,</hi> when the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> whoſe cauſe led them to deny it, yet durſt not do it directly, becauſe they knew it would not be endured; and therefore they confeſſed that Infants were to be Baptiz'd, to qualifie them for the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but not for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin.</hi> So that they themſelves ſeemed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſaving effect of Baptiſm to Infants; though as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> often ſhewed them, they contradicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſo doing. But they durſt do no otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Doctrine of the Church was ſo plainly againſt them in this matter, and every Believer was ſo ſettled in it, that I remember St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſomewhere ſpeaks to this purpoſe, that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> would have come to the point, and denied that the Baptiſm of Infants ſignified any thing at all to their Salvation, and therefore might be as well let alone; but that they were afraid the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themſelves of thoſe Children would every where reproach them for it.</p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:451"/>
                        <p>The other Objection againſt the Office of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is this, That the <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> that anſwer for Infants, are not their <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Guardians,</hi> but others, who have, they ſay, <hi>no Authority</hi> to <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Act in their Names.</hi> In anſwer to whih, I ſhall omit ſeveral things that might be ſaid, and content my ſelf with theſe two things, which I think may be ſufficient.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That in all caſes where the Sureties are procured by the <hi>Parents,</hi> there they have <hi>Authority to Covenant</hi> in behalf of the Infant; and this the Objectors muſt grant, I think, upon their own Principles: ſince they contend that <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Pro-parents</hi> are fitteſt to act in behalf of the <hi>Baptized</hi> Infants, as having Authority ſo to do, ſince they have the Power to diſpoſe of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation afterward. For then the Sureties which are by them prevailed with to ſtand for their Children, have at leaſt all that Authority which the Parents can give them. And this is ſufficiently known to be the caſe with us. And this is that which the Church might well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sureties, which contract with the Church in the Infants Name, would be procured by the Parents; ſo that the Parents Contracting in behalf of the Infant, is included in the Undertaking of the Sureties, who although they are required by the Church to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the Infant, yet are they ſuppoſed to be <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd</hi> by its Parents alſo, ſo to do,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The good Deſign of this Order and Appointment in the Church ought to be conſidered, which is not the leſs, for the fault of Men, and the looſeneſs of theſe times, does often defeat it. For hereby the Church taketh greater ſecurity, that the Infant ſhall be brought up in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Practice of that Holy Covenant into which it is Baptiz'd: In as much as beſides the care of the Parents, which is in effect promiſed, and may be more reaſonably rely'd upon without their own Solemn Act, upon the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:451"/> account of that <hi>Natural Affection</hi> which makes them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerned; beſides this, I ſay, there is a <hi>Particular Obligation</hi> laid upon others alſo, to ſee that the Infant be ſo Educated, as much as in them lies. In caſe the <hi>Parents ſhould die</hi> before the Child is grown to years of Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Sureties are then more Particularly Obliged to look to their Godchild, that he be put into a way of learning and doing his Duty. If they <hi>ſhould not die</hi> before, but be <hi>remiſs,</hi> the Sureties have Authority to come to them and Admoniſh them of their Duty, and to let them know, that ſince themſelves were deſired by them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for this Child, they as ſuch Sureties are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned to mind the Parents of their Duty, and if need be to <hi>rebuke them ſharply</hi> for neglecting it; ſince they did in effect, and to all purpoſe of Obligation under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for the performance of it, when the Sureties under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for the Child. Moreover when <hi>the Child is grown to years of Knowledge,</hi> and come abroad into the World, <hi>he is liable to</hi> the Charitable Admonitions of his Sureties as well as of his Parents, in caſe he does amiſs, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs are more likely to take place, than thoſe of moſt other Perſons. Now though all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Members of one Body</hi> are to take care of, and to watch over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet ſome are more Particularly Obliged, and have greater Advantages to do thoſe Works of Spiritual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than others. And I appeal to all conſidering Men, if <hi>Sureties at Baptiſm,</hi> may not with great Authority, and with likelyhood of good effect, Reprove both thoſe <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Parents</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nruly Children</hi> for whom they have undertaken to the Church. The Parents for not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Educate their Children in the knowledge and keeping of the Baptiſmal Vow; or the Children for not hearkening to good Admonition. And in this Age when the Duty of Chriſtian Reproof is ſo generally omitted; it were well if the defect were this way a little ſupplied.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:452"/> But it is by no means deſireable that the opportunity thereof, and the obligation thereunto ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I know ſome will be apt to ſay, that this is but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Practiſed. But that is no ſufficient Anſwer to what I have ſaid. For when we uſe to judge of the goodneſs of a Rule or Cuſtom by the good that comes of obſerving it, we muſt look where 'tis kept, though it be kept but by few, and not where 'tis broken. And if the Diſſenters have nothing to ſay againſt the uſe of Sureties, but that the end of this Appointment is ſeldom regarded, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may help to remove this Objection, by returning to the Church, and encreaſing the number of thoſe that do purſue the End of it. And thus doing they ſhall have the benefit of this Order of the Church, and the Church the benefit of their good Examples.</p>
                        <p>As for the uſe of the <hi>Interrogatories</hi> put to the Sureties, and their <hi>Anſwers,</hi> they are a Solemn Declaration of what Baptiſm doth oblige all Baptiz'd Perſons to, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants do ſtand ingaged to perform the Vow of Baptiſm when they ſhall come to years of knowledge. This is the known meaning of the Contract, nor did I ever hear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that otherwiſe underſtood it; and therefore I ſee not why it ſhould be ſaid to be <hi>liable to miſunderſtanding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After all, there is one General Objection yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſtill prevails with ſome Perſons, and that is, That ſome of our Prayers are to be found in the <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> and the <hi>Breviary,</hi> and the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Objection hath made a great noiſe, but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Underſtanding Men, if there be any ſenſe in it.</p>
                        <p>No Man will ſay, that 'tis enough to make any Prayer, or Form of Devotion or Inſtruction unlawful to be uſed, that the ſame is to be found in the <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> &amp;c. For then the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and a great part of the Scriptures beſides, and the <hi>Creeds</hi> muſt never be uſed by us. And therefore whether any part of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:452"/> Service is to be uſed by us or not, muſt be judged of by ſome other Rule, that is by the Word of God. So that 'tis a vain Exception againſt any part of our Liturgie, to ſay it was <hi>taken out of the Maſs-Book,</hi> unleſs it could be ſhewn withal, that it is ſome part of the <hi>Romiſh Superſtition.</hi> I know it has been ſaid, that the Scriptures being of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary uſe are to be retained by us, though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> retains them; but that there is not the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for Forms which are not neceſſary; but in thoſe we ought to go as far from that Church as ever we can. But what reaſon is there for this? For the Danger that may happen <hi>to us</hi> in coming too near them, lies in things wherein they do ill, not in which they do well. And as for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, we do not in the leaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance them wherein they are wrong, by agreeing with them wherein they are right. And as for the <hi>Things</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are not the worſe for being uſed by them. We ſhould allow the <hi>Papiſts</hi> a greater Power to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than they have, if their uſing of ſome good things ſhould render all uſe of them hurtful to us. The Caſe in ſhort is this, When our Reformers were intent upon the Reformation of the Liturgie, they deſigned to Purge it of all thoſe corrupt Additions, which the uſurpt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had long ſince brought into it; and to retain nothing but what was agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, and to the Practice of the purer Ages of the Church. And in this they did like Wiſe Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thus it would be evident to all the World, that they Reformed upon juſt &amp; neceſſary Reaſons, and not meerly out of a deſire of Change and Innovation; ſince they Purged the Forms of Divine Service, from nothing but Innovations and Corruptions, and an unprofitable croud of Ceremonies. No Man can ſhew a good Reaſon why thoſe Paſſages in the Common-Prayer-Book, which are to be found in the <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> but which were uſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:453"/> by the Church before <hi>Romaniſm</hi> had Corrupted it, are not as much to be Valued becauſe they were once uſed by good Chriſtians, as to be run down becauſe they have been ſince uſed by Superſtitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Men. But to conclude this Matter, If any Man would ſet himſelf to expoſe the <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> he would I ſuppoſe lay hold upon nothing but the Corruptions that are in it, and things that are obnoxious to juſt reproof; not on things that are juſtifiable and may eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. And the reaſon of this is plain, becauſe the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> is to blame for thoſe parts of it only, but not for <hi>theſe.</hi> Now for ſuch Paſſages as the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> it ſelf is not to be blamed for, neither is our <hi>Liturgie</hi> to be blamed, if we will ſpeak juſtly of things, and without Prejudice and Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>I have now conſidered all thoſe Exceptions againſt the Solemn Service of God by our Liturgie, which the Diſſenters are thought to inſiſt moſt upon. Not but that ſome other Exceptions have been made by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of that perſuaſion: But this I hope was without deſign to prejudice the People againſt our Communion, but rather to gain ſome alterations, which in their Judgment would have been advantageous to the Book of Common-Prayer, and given it a greater perfection; whether they were right in this or not, I will not now diſpute; being very deſirous, as I pray God we may all be, to avoid Controverſies in this Matter as much as may be. Nay, I believe thoſe Prejudices of the <hi>Lay-</hi>Diſſenters againſt the Common-Prayer, which I have endeavoured to remove, have wrought in them a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a verſion to it, than the beſt Divines of that way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; (I ſhould be very ſorry to find my ſelf miſtaken in this.) And this conſideration was ſome encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me to give a true account of thoſe things they ſeemed to diſlike moſt of all.</p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:453"/>
                        <p>Which I have endeavoured upon the plain grounds of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> almoſt wholly avoiding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to other <hi>Church Antiquity,</hi> not but that great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had of it, and that we can defend our ſelves by it; but becauſe they are very few in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon who are qualified to Examine this kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. And the like I ſay of the Concurrence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformed Churches with us in thoſe things that are diſliked.</p>
                        <p>As for the Sign of the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> it is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this is a <hi>part of Worſhip,</hi> or a <hi>Sacrament of Mans making.</hi> The contrary to which, has been ſo plainly ſhewn in late Diſcourſes, that unleſs I am called to give an account of it, I cannot think fit to trouble you with this Diſpute. But I heartily deſire our Brethren to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider at length, that though the uſe of this Ceremony were not ſo eaſie to be defended as I think it is, yet that it is no Condition of Communion, becauſe the <hi>People</hi> are not required to Sign with the Sign of the Croſs, but the <hi>Miniſter</hi> only.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Kneeling at the Communion</hi> of the Holy Table, that is indeed every Communicants Act, but of this you may expect a Diſcourſe from another Hand, which I hope will give ſatisfaction to all Sober Perſons, that are yet unſatisfied about it.</p>
                        <p>And now I intreat all thoſe of the Diſſenting Party, into whoſe hands theſe Papers ſhall fall, that they would ſeriouſly conſider, whether it be fit to venture the <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and the <hi>ſad Conſequences</hi> of it, likely to come to paſs, upon ſuch grounds as theſe: Let us at length conſult for the Honour of this Age with Poſterity, who will ſtand amazed to find a Separation of Proteſtants from this Church, carried on ſo long upon ſo little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given, and ſuch weak Objections ſo ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, as to build an oppoſite Communion upon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:454"/> them. Let us Conſult the <hi>Honour</hi> and the <hi>Safety</hi> of the Reformation, and no longer ſuffer it to be expoſed to ſcorn and dnager, to be Laught at, and Diſgraced by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> our dangerous Enemies always, but never <hi>more dangerous</hi> than now. If the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the wide breach they have made in the Communion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> will certainly let in <hi>Popery,</hi> if it be not prevented by a timely cloſing with the <hi>Church of England:</hi> Nothing remains but to wait till they are convinced by the laſt Extremity. I can take no comfort in being aſſured that at laſt they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, when, alas! it will be to no purpoſe to believe it. I beſeech them to conſider, whether we are likely to be united in any other Communion, but that of the <hi>Church of England</hi> as it is by <hi>Law Eſtabliſhed;</hi> and whether ſo little account ought to be made of Law and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to ſay that our Governours may as well come down to them, by forbearing to require what they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; as they come up to the Law, by doing what it requires. Will our caſe bear this wantonneſs? Will ſuch Expreſſions conſiſt with our Duty? I beſeech them by what is moſt dear to them, by the Honour of God, and the Love of Chriſt, and the Care of their own Souls, and the Charity they have for the Souls of other Men, that they will take pains with themſelves to lay aſide Prejudice, and Anger, and all Paſſions that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct a clear Judgment of things that have been diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt us, and that they would conſider impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially what we have ſaid, as in the ſight of God who knoweth the Hearts of Men. Can they propound to themſelves more beneficial Deſigns, than to check the Prophaneneſs and Atheiſm which in this laſt Age hath been ſo much complained of, than to reſtore in ſome meaſure the Ancient Diſcipline of the Church for the excluding of vicious Men from the Communion of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:454"/> Faithful, than to tranſmit the Profeſſion of the true Religion Eſtabliſht among us, down to their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? The moſt effectual means by which they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to all thoſe good Ends, is to return heartily and unanimouſly to the Communion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> all the true Sons whereof are ready to receive them with open Arms, with joy and thankfulneſs to God, and to them, for the good they will do us and themſelves by it. But as for them, that for Worldly and Corrupt Intereſts, encourage and ſupport the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Separation from this Church, I cannot expoſtulate with them in this manner, ſince ſuch Men have not the fear of God before them, and 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be touched with tenderneſs for the Concerns of Religion, while they continue as they are. All I ſhall ſay to them is, That when that great day of Judgment comes, which they of all Men have moſt reaſon to be afraid of, then all the diſmal Conſequences of this Schiſm which are likely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, will be fully required at their hands to be ſure; whilſt thoſe that in meer Ignorance and Miſtake have contributed to them, ſhall have an eaſier Account to give, eſpecially if they have taken pains to inform themſelves better.</p>
                        <p>What good Effect our Applications to Men will have, we cannot ſay; but if it ſhall appear that they are not yet prepared for Inſtruction; we have the more reaſon to turn our ſelves to God by earneſt Prayer, that he would pleaſe to open the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſimple, and to detect the ill Deſigns of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt Men; and to enable us to bring forth more and better Fruits of Repentance, that whatever happens to this Church, <hi>it may not be forſaken of his Favour and Protection,</hi> Amen.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt, Our</hi> Church is at the greateſt diſtance from that of <hi>Rome, in all thoſe Doctrines and Practices, by which ſhe deprives her Members of their due Liberty, and miſerably inſlaves them.</hi> For inſtance,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This Church denieth her Members all <hi>Judgment of diſcretion</hi> in matters of Religion: She obligeth them to follow her <hi>blindfold,</hi> and to reſolve both their Faith and Judgment into <hi>hers;</hi> as aſſuming <hi>infallibility</hi> to her ſelf, and binding all under pain of Damnation to <hi>believe</hi> her Infallible.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>our</hi> Church permits us the <hi>full</hi> enjoyment of our due Liberty in believing and judging; and we Act not like Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction) we <hi>prove not all things,</hi> that we may <hi>hold faſt that which is good,</hi> if we <hi>believe every Spirit,</hi> (which St. <hi>John</hi> cautions us againſt) and do not <hi>try the Spirits, whether they be of God;</hi> which he requires us to do. 'Tis impoſſible that our Church ſhould oblige us to an <hi>implicite</hi> Faith in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe ſhe diſclaimeth all pretence to <hi>infallibility:</hi> Our Church tells us, in her <hi>19th Article,</hi> that, <hi>As the</hi>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:457"/> 
                           <hi>Churches of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and</hi> Antioch, <hi>have erred; ſo alſo the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath erred, not only in their Living and manner of Ceremonies, but alſo in matters of Faith.</hi> And our Churches acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment is plainly implyed, in aſſerting the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Churches in the World to have erred from the Faith, that ſhe <hi>her ſelf</hi> muſt needs be Obnoxious to Errour in matters of Faith; and that ſhe would be guilty of the higheſt <hi>impudence</hi> in <hi>denying</hi> it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> impoſeth a deal of moſt ſlaviſh Drudgery in the vaſt multitude of her <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>unreaſonably ſevere Tasks,</hi> and <hi>cruel Penances.</hi> As to her <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> they are ſo vaſt a number, as are enough to take up (as Sir <hi>Edwyn Sandys</hi> hath obſerved) a great part of a mans life mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gaze on: And abundance of them are ſo vain and Childiſh, ſo marvellouſly odd and uncouth, as that <hi>they can naturally bring</hi> (to uſe that Gentlemans words, who was a curious obſerver of them in the Popiſh Countries) <hi>no other than diſgrace and contempt, to thoſe exerciſes of Religion wherein they are ſtirring.</hi> In viewing only thoſe that are injoyned in the Common <hi>Ritual,</hi> one would bleſs ones ſelf to think how it ſhould enter into the minds of <hi>Men,</hi> and much more of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to invent ſuch things. And the like may be ſaid of the Popiſh <hi>Tasks</hi> and <hi>Penances,</hi> in impoſing of which the Prieſts are Arbitrary, and ordinarily lay the moſt Severe and Cruel ones on the lighteſt offenders, when the moſt Leud and Scandalous come off with a bare ſaying of their Beads thrice over, or ſome ſuch inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant and idle buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> impoſeth nothing of that Drudgery, which makes ſuch Vaſſals of the poor Papiſts. Her <hi>Rites</hi> are exceeding <hi>few,</hi> and thoſe <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>eaſie, grave</hi> and <hi>manly,</hi> founded on the Practice of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:458"/> the Church, long before Popery appeared upon the Stage of the World. Our Church hath abandon'd the <hi>five Popiſh Sacraments,</hi> and contents her ſelf with thoſe <hi>two</hi> which Chriſt hath ordained: As is to be ſeen in her 25th <hi>Article,</hi> where ſhe declares, that <hi>There are two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments ordained of Chriſt our Lord in the Goſpel; that is to ſay, Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord. Thoſe five commonly called Sacraments; that is to ſay, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nxion, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Goſpel; being ſuch as have grown, partly of the Corrupt following of the Apoſtles, partly are ſtates of life allowed in the Scriptures: But yet have not like Nature of Sacraments with Baptiſm and the Lords Supper: For that they have not any viſible Sign or Ceremony ordained of God. The Sacraments were not ordained of Chriſt, to be gazed upon, or to be carried about,</hi> &amp;c. And in ſaying that our Church owns not the fore-mentioned Popiſh Sacraments, is implied that ſhe hath nothing to do with any of thoſe very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Superſtitious Fopperies which are injoyned in the Offices appointed for the Adminiſtration of thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>Our</hi> Church no whit more imitates that of <hi>Rome</hi> in her Cruel <hi>Tasks and Penances,</hi> than in her <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi> as is needleſs to be ſhewed.</p>

                           <hi>Mans Authority, ſo that all things be done to Edifying.</hi> And this Article <hi>begins</hi> thus: <hi>It is not neceſſary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed according to the diverſities of Countrys, Times and Manners; ſo that nothing be Ordained againſt Gods Word.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſubjects her Members by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of her Doctrines to inſlaving <hi>Paſſions.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that of <hi>Purgatory</hi> makes them all their life-time ſubject to the bondages of <hi>Fear;</hi> at leaſt thoſe of them who are ſo ſollicitous about the life to come, as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any miſtruſt or doubting (as it's ſtrange if the moſt <hi>Credulous</hi> of them do not) concerning the Efficacy of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> and <hi>Indulgences.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Her Doctrine of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion</hi> ſubjects all that are not forſaken of all Modeſty, to the paſſion of <hi>Shame.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Her Doctrine of the <hi>Dependance of the Efficacy of the Sacraments upon the Prieſts intention,</hi> muſt needs expoſe all conſiderative people, and thoſe who have any ſerious concern about their ſtate hereafter, to great <hi>Anxiety</hi> and <hi>Solicitude.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>theſe</hi> Doctrines are all rejected by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That of <hi>Purgatory</hi> ſhe declares againſt in <hi>theſe</hi> Words, <hi>Article</hi> 22<hi>d. The Romiſh Doctrine of Purgatory, is a vain thing fondly invented, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on no Warranty of Scripture, but rather Repugnant to the Word of God.</hi> As to that of <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> nothing like it is taught or practiſed in <hi>our</hi> Church. Her Members are obliged onely to Confeſs their Sins to <hi>God,</hi> except when 'tis neceſſary to Confeſs them to <hi>Men,</hi> for the relieving of their Conſciences, and their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Prayers of others; or in order to the righting of thoſe they have wronged, when due ſatisfaction can't otherwiſe be made; or in order to their giving Glory to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:459"/> God, when they are juſtly accuſed, and their guilt proved: in which caſes, and ſuch like, 'tis without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our duty to confeſs to <hi>Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor have we any ſuch Doctrine in <hi>our</hi> Church, as that of the <hi>Dependence of the Efficacy of the Sacraments on the Prieſts intention;</hi> but the <hi>contrary</hi> is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, <hi>Article 26th, viz.</hi> that <hi>The Efficacy of Chriſts Ordinance is not taken away by the Wickedneſs</hi> of thoſe that Miniſter.</p>
                        <p>3. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſubjects her Members by not a few of her Doctrines and Practices to <hi>Vile Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> of all ſorts: As might be largely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">See <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> Chap. 17.</note> and will be in part, under the next Head of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>our</hi> Church neither maintains any Licentious Principle, nor gives Countenance to any ſuch Practice; our Adverſaries themſelves being Judges.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> is at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance from that of <hi>Rome, in all thoſe Doctrines and Practices in which ſhe is juſtly charged with plainly contradicting the Holy Scripture.</hi> For inſtance, (not to repeat any of thoſe ranked under the <hi>foregoing</hi> head, ſeveral of which may alſo fall under <hi>this)</hi> Her Doctrines of <hi>Image-Worſhip,</hi> of <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> (with her groſs practiſing upon them) of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> of <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> wherein Chriſt is pretended to be ſtill offered up afreſh for the quick and dead. <hi>Her keeping the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the Vulgar, and making it ſo hainous a crime to read the Bible,</hi> becauſe by this means her foul Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours will be in ſuch danger of being diſcovered, and the People, of not continuing implicite believers. <hi>Her injoyning the ſaying of Prayers, and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments, in an unknown Tongue. Her Robbing the Laity of the Cup in the Lords Supper.</hi>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:459"/> 
                           <hi>Her prohibiting Marriage to Prieſts. Her Doctrines of Merit, and works of Supererogation. Her making ſimple Fornication a mere Venial ſin. Her damning all that are not of her Communion. Her moſt deviliſh cruelties towards thoſe whom ſhe is pleaſed to pronounce Hereticks.</hi> Her darling Sons Doctrines of <hi>Equivocation</hi> and <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Reſervations; of the Popes power of diſpenſing with the moſt Solemn Oaths, and of abſolving Subjects from their Allegiance to their Lawful Princes:</hi> with many others not now to be reckoned up.</p>
                        <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> Abominates <hi>theſe</hi> and the <hi>like</hi> Principles and Practices. As to the inſtances of <hi>Image-Worſhip, Invocation of Saints,</hi> and <hi>Pardons and Indulgences,</hi> what our Church declareth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Purgatory,</hi> ſhe adds concerning <hi>theſe</hi> things too, <hi>Article</hi> 22<hi>d.</hi> viz. <hi>That the Romiſh Doctrine concerning Pardons, Worſhip and Adoration, as well of Images as of Relicks, as alſo Invocation of Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded on no Warranty of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but rather Repugnant to the Word of God.</hi> And as there is no ſuch Practice as Worſhipping of Images in <hi>our</hi> Church, ſo all are deſtroyed which Popery had Erected among us. Nor have we in <hi>our</hi> Church any <hi>Co-Mediators</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt; we Worſhip only one God, by one only Mediator, the Man Chriſt Jeſus. And the now-mentioned Practices, our Church doth not only declare to be <hi>Repugnant to the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> but to be likewiſe moſt groſly <hi>Idolatrous, viz.</hi> in the <hi>Homilies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> our Church declareth her ſenſe thereof, <hi>Article 28th.</hi> in <hi>theſe</hi> Words: <hi>Tranſubſtantiation (or the change of the ſubſtance of</hi> Bread and Wine) <hi>in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but it is repugnant to the plain terms of Scripture; overthroweth the Nature</hi>
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:460"/> 
                           <hi>of a Sacrament; and hath given occaſion to many Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions. The Body of Chriſt is given, taken and eaten in the Lords Supper, only after an Heavenly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner; and the mean whereby the Body of Chriſt is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, was not by Chriſts Ordinance reſerved, carried about, lifted up, or Worſhipped. As to the Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> ſee what our Church ſaith of it, <hi>Article 31ſt.</hi> viz. <hi>That the offering of Chriſt once made, is that perfect Redemption, Propitiation and Satisfaction for all the Sins of the whole World, both Original and Actual; and there is none other Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſins but that alone. Wherefore the Sacrifices of Maſſes, in the which it was commonly ſaid, that the Prieſt did offer Chriſt for the quick and the dead, to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of pain or guilt, were Blaſphemous Fables, and dangerous deceits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Church of</hi> Romes <hi>locking up the Scriptures, and prohibiting the reading of them, Our</hi> Church hath not only more than once cauſed them to be Tranſlated into our Mother-Tongue, but alſo, as I need not ſhew, gives as free Liberty to the reading of the <hi>Bible,</hi> as of any <hi>other</hi> Book; nor is any duty in our Church eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more neceſſary, than that of Reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and Hearing them read.</p>
                        <p>As to <hi>Praying and Adminiſtring the Sacraments in an unknown Tongue,</hi> as <hi>this</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo is it to her <hi>Declaration</hi> alſo, <hi>Article 24th.</hi> viz. <hi>That it is a thing plainly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Word of God, and the Cuſtom of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, to have publick Prayers in the Church, or to Adminiſter Sacraments in a Tongue not underſtanded of the People.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:460"/>
                        <p>As to <hi>Robbing the Laity of the Cup in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi> in <hi>Our</hi> Church they may not receive the <hi>Bread,</hi> if they refuſe the <hi>Cup.</hi> And <hi>Article</hi> 30. tells us, <hi>That the Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Laity; for both the parts of the Lords Sacrament, by Chriſts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and Commandment, ought to be Adminiſtred to all Chriſtians alike. As to prohibiting Marriage to Prieſts, this</hi> is declared againſt, <hi>Article</hi> 32. <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons are not Commanded by Gods Law, either to vow the Eſtate of ſingle Life, or to abſtain from Marriage; therefore it is Lawful for them, as for all other Chriſtian Men, to Marry at their own diſcretion, as they ſhall judge the ſame to ſerve better to godlineſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to the Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>Merit,</hi> Our Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares againſt <hi>this, Article</hi> 11. <hi>We are accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, and not for our own Works, or Deſervings. Wherefore, that we are juſtified by Faith only, (viz.</hi> ſuch a Faith as <hi>purifies the Heart,</hi> and <hi>works by Love) is a moſt wholſome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort; as more largely is expreſſed in the Homily of</hi> Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>As to the Doctrine of <hi>Supererogation, this</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, <hi>Article</hi> 14. <hi>Voluntary Works, beſides, over and above Gods Commandments, which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without Arrogance and Impiety: For by them Men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his ſake than of bounden duty is required: whereas Chriſt ſaith plainly, When ye have done all that are Commanded to you, ſay, We are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to <hi>making ſimple Fornication a meer Venial ſin; Our</hi> Church will endure no ſuch Doctrine. For as in the <hi>Litany</hi> ſhe calls Fornication expreſly a <hi>deadly</hi> ſin,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:461"/> ſo hath it ever been accounted in Our Church, one of the <hi>moſt</hi> deadly, even conſidered as <hi>diſtinct</hi> from Adultery.</p>
                        <p>As to the Church of <hi>Romes Damning all that are not of her Communion,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> is guilty of no uncharitableneſs <hi>like</hi> it; and never pronounced ſo ſad a ſentence againſt thoſe in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as great a deteſtation as ſhe expreſſeth, in the <hi>Homilies,</hi> eſpecially of her Idolatrous and Wicked Principles and Practices. She is ſatisfied to Condemn the groſs Corruptions of that Apoſtate Church, and leaves her Members to ſtand or fall to their own Maſter, nor takes upon her to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchurch</hi> her.</p>
                        <p>And as to the remaining moſt <hi>Immoral</hi> Principles and Practices of the Romiſh Church, which are all as contrary to <hi>Natural</hi> as to <hi>revealed</hi> Religion, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enemies Our Church hath, cannot ſurely have the forehead to charge her with giving the leaſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to any <hi>ſuch.</hi> There being no Church in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom that more ſeverely Condemns all inſtances of Unrighteouſneſs and Immorality.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> is at a mighty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in reference to <hi>their Publick Prayers and Offices.</hi> Whereas our <hi>Liturgy</hi> hath been by many Condemned, as greatly reſembling the <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> all that have compared them do know the contrary, and that there is a vaſt difference between them, both as <hi>to matter</hi> and <hi>form:</hi> Although ſome few of the <hi>ſame</hi> Prayers are found in both: and three or four of the ſame Rites; <hi>of which more hereafter.</hi> To ſhew this throughout in the <hi>particulars,</hi> would be a very long and tedious task: I will therefore ſingle out the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Adminiſtration of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> as we have it in the <hi>Roman Ritual,</hi> and deſire the Reader to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with that in <hi>our</hi> Liturgy; and by <hi>this</hi> take a meaſure of the likeneſs between our Liturgy and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:461"/> Maſs-Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there being no greater agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Morning and Evening Services, and the <hi>other</hi> Offices of <hi>each,</hi> than is between <hi>theſe</hi> two; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that, beſides the <hi>Lords</hi> Prayer, there is <hi>no</hi> Prayer belonging to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Office of Baptiſm to be met with in <hi>ours.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the ſake of the Readers who underſtand no more of the Language that the Popiſh Prayers and Offices are expreſſed in, than the generality of thoſe that make <hi>uſe</hi> of them, take the following account of the Popiſh Admoniſtration of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> in our <hi>own</hi> Tongue.</p>
                        <p>To paſs by the long Bedroul of Preparatory Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, the Prieſt, being dreſt in a Surplice and Purple Robe, calls the Infant to be Baptized by his <hi>Name,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>What askeſt thou of the Church of God?</hi> the God-Father anſwers, <hi>Faith.</hi> The Prieſt ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>What ſhalt thou get by Faith?</hi> The God-Father replies, <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Then adds the <hi>Prieſt, If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments; Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next, the Prieſt blows three gentle puffs upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants face, and ſaith (as if we come all into the World poſſeſſed by the Devil,) <hi>Go out of him, O unclean Spirit, and give place to the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter.</hi> Then with his Thumb he makes the Sign of the Croſs, on the Infants Forehead and Breaſt, ſaying; <hi>Receive the Sign of the Croſs both in thy Forehead, and in thy heart: Take the Faith of the Heavenly Precepts, and be thy manners ſuch, as that thou maiſt now become the Temple of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After <hi>this</hi> follows a Prayer that <hi>God would always protect this his Elect one</hi> (calling him by his Name) <hi>that is Signed with the Sign of the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a longer Prayer (the Prieſt laying his hand on the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:462"/> Infants head) comes the <hi>Benediction of Salt:</hi> of which <hi>this</hi> is the Form.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I exorcize (or conjure) thee, O Creature of Salt, in the Name of God the Father Almighty</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, <hi>and in the Love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>. <hi>I conjure thee by the Living God</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, <hi>by the true God</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, <hi>by the Holy God</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>; <hi>by the God</hi>

                           <hi>which Created thee for the ſafeguard of Mankind, and hath ordained that thou ſhouldeſt be conſecrated by his Servants, to the People entring into the Faith, that, in the Name of the Holy Trinity, thou ſhouldeſt be made a wholeſome Sacrament, for the driving away of the Enemy. Moreover, we Pray thee, O Lord our God, that in Sanctifying thou wouldeſt Sanctifie</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> 
                           <hi>this Creature of Salt, and in Bleſſing thou wouldeſt Bleſs it</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, <hi>that it may be to all that receive it a perfect Medicine remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Bowels, in the Name of the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; who is about to come to judge the quick and dead, and the World by fire, Amen.</hi> This Idle and prophane Form being recited, the Prieſt proceeds in his Work with the poor Infant; and next, putting a little of this Holy Salt into his mouth, he calls him by his Name, and ſaith, <hi>Take thou the Salt of Wiſdom:</hi> (and adds moſt impiouſly) <hi>be it thy propitiation unto Eternal Life, Amen.</hi> This ended with the <hi>Pax tecum,</hi> God Almighty is next mockt with a Prayer, <hi>That this Infant, who hath taſted this firſt food of Salt, may not be ſuffered any more to hunger, but may be filled with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Food,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now follows <hi>another</hi> Exorciſing of the Devil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is conjured as before, and moſt wofully becalled. And next the Prieſt Signs the Infant again with his Thumb on the Forehead, ſaying, <hi>And this Sign of the Holy Croſs</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> 
                           <hi>which we give to his Forehead, thou Curſed Devil never dare thou to Violate. By the ſame</hi>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:462"/> 
                           <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.</hi> And now after all this tedious expectation, we ſee ſome Sign of Baptiſm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, for the Prieſt puts his hand again on the Infants head, and puts up a very good Prayer for him, in order to his Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>The Prayer being ended, he puts part of his Robe upon the Infant, and brings him within the Church, (for he hath been without all this while) ſaying, (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him by his Name) <hi>Enter thou into the Temple of God, that thou mayeſt partake with Chriſt in Eternal Life, Amen.</hi> Then follow the Apoſtles Creed, and the <hi>Pater Noſter.</hi> But after all this, here's more exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe for our Patience; for the Prieſt falls to his fooling again: For now comes another Exorciſing or Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Devil. And this being alſo concluded, the Prieſt takes Spittle out of his Mouth, and touches therewith the Ears and Noſtrils of the Infant. And in touching his right and left Ear, he ſaith, <hi>Ephphatha,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Be opened.</hi> Then, touching his Noſtrils, he ſaith, <hi>for a ſavour of ſweetneſs:</hi> (no doubt mighty ſweet!) <hi>Another</hi> Conjuration of the Devil followeth, in <hi>theſe</hi> Words, <hi>Be packing, O Devil, for the judgment of God is at hand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now the Prieſt will make you hope again that he hath not forgotten his main buſineſs: For he asks the Infant, whether he renounces the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>all his Works,</hi> and <hi>all his Pomps;</hi> of which he makes three Queſtions; and the God-Father diſtinctly anſwers to them. But alas he is thus ſoon gone off from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Work again, for now you have him dipping his Thumb in <hi>Holy Oyl,</hi> and Anointing the Infant with it in his Breaſt, and betwixt his Shoulders, in the figure of a Croſs, ſaying, <hi>I Anoint thee with the Oyl of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, that thou mayeſt obtain Eternal Life, Amen.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We proceed to ſhew, that there is alſo no ſmall diſtance between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> in reference <hi>to the Books they receive for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> This will be Immediately diſpatched: For no more is to be ſaid upon <hi>this</hi> ſubject, but that, whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes all the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Canon, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> like all other Proteſtant Churches, receives only thoſe Books of the Old and New Teſtament for Canonical Scripture, as ſhe declares in her Sixth Article, <hi>of whoſe Authority there was never any doubt in the Church.</hi> And ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth concerning the Apocryphal Books in the ſame Article, citing St. <hi>Hierom</hi> for her Authority, <hi>That the Church doth read them for Example of life, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of manners; but yet it doth not apply them to Eſtabliſh any Doctrine.</hi> And after the example of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, no more doth <hi>ours;</hi> and appoints the reading ſome of them only upon the foreſaid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> place, The Church of <hi>England</hi> is at the greateſt diſtance poſſible from the Church of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:465"/> 
                           <hi>Rome,</hi> in reference to <hi>the Authority on which they each found their whole Religion.</hi> As to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe makes her own Infallibility the Foundation of Faith. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Our belief of the Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures <hi>themſelves,</hi> muſt, according to <hi>her</hi> Doctrine, be founded upon her infallible Teſtimony.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to that Prodigious deal which ſhe hath added of her <hi>own</hi> to the Doctrines and Precepts of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and which ſhe makes as neceſſary to be believed and practiſed, as any matters of Faith and Practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures (and <hi>more</hi> neceſſary too, than many of them) the Authority of thoſe things is founded upon her unwritten Traditions, and the Decrees of her Councils; which ſhe will have to be no leſs inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, than were the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves.</p>
                        <p>But Contrariwiſe, the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Build the whole of <hi>her</hi> Religion upon the <hi>Sole</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Divine Revelation in the <hi>Holy Scriptures:</hi> And therefore ſhe takes <hi>every jot</hi> thereof out of the Bible. She makes the Scriptures the <hi>Complete</hi> Rule of her <hi>Faith,</hi> and of her <hi>Practice</hi> too, in all matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, that is, in all the <hi>parts</hi> or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor is there any Genuine Son of <hi>this</hi> Church, that maketh any thing a part of his Religion that is not <hi>plainly</hi> contained in the Bible. Let us ſee what our Church declareth to this purpoſe, in her 16 <hi>Article,</hi> viz. <hi>That Holy Scripture containeth all things neceſſary to Salvation; ſo that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of any Man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite or neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> So that, as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſaith, <hi>THE BIBLE, THE BIBLE IS THE RELIGION OF PROTESTANTS:</hi>
                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:465"/> So you ſee the Bible is the Religion of the Proteſtant Church of <hi>England:</hi> Nor doth ſhe fetch one <hi>Tittle</hi> of her Religion either out of unwritten Traditions, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councils. Notwithſtanding ſhe hath a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for thoſe Councils which were not a Company of Biſhops and Prieſts of the <hi>Popes</hi> packing, to ſerve his purpoſes, and which have beſt deſerved the Name of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Four firſt;</hi> yet her Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them conſiſteth not in any opinion of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility:</hi> As appears by <hi>Article</hi> 14. <hi>General Councils may not be gathered together without the Commandment and Will of Princes; and when they be gathered together (for as much as they be an Aſſembly of Men, whereof all be not Governed with the Spirit and Word of God) they may Err, and ſometimes have Erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things ordained by them as neceſſary to Salvation, have neither Strength nor Authority, unleſs it may be declared</hi> (that is, manifeſtly proved) <hi>that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us ſee again how our Church ſpeaks of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, <hi>Article</hi> 20. <hi>The Church hath Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Rites or Ceremonies, and Authority in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Faith: And yet it is not Lawful for the Church to Ordain any thing that is contrary to Gods Word Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; neither may it ſo Expound one place of Scripture, that it be Repugnant to another. Wherefore although the Church be a Witneſs and Keeper of Holy Writ</hi> (that is, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was ſo of the Canon of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, by whoſe Tradition alone it could be known, what Books were Canonical, and what not; ſo the Catholick <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, from Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles downwards is ſo, of the Canon of the <hi>New;) Yet as it ought not to decree any thing againſt the ſame, ſo beſides the ſame ought it not to inforce any thing to be believed for neceſſity of Salvation.</hi> If it be asked <hi>who</hi>
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:466"/> is to Judge, what is agreeable or contrary to Holy Writ? 'tis manifeſt that Our Church leaves it to <hi>every</hi> Man to Judge for himſelf. But 'tis Objected, that 'tis to be acknowledged, that if the Church only claimed a Power to Decree <hi>Rites and Ceremonies;</hi> (that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general Rules of doing all things <hi>Decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Orderly,</hi> and to <hi>Edification,</hi> which Power <hi>all</hi> Churches have ever Exerciſed) <hi>this</hi> may well enough conſiſt with private Perſons Liberty to Judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but 'tis alſo ſaid in the now Cited Article, that <hi>the Church hath Authority in Controverſies of Faith;</hi> and accordingly <hi>Our</hi> Church hath Publiſht 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> and requires of the Clergy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Subſcription to them. To this we anſwer, that we ſhall make one Article Egregiouſly to Contradict another, and one and the ſame to Contradict it ſelf, if we underſtand by the Authority in Controverſies of Faith, which <hi>Our</hi> Church acknowledges <hi>all</hi> Churches to have, any more than Authority to Oblige their Members to outward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when their Deciſions are ſuch as Contradict not any of the Eſſentials of our Religion, whether they be <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Rules of Life;</hi> not an Authority to Oblige them to aſſent to their Decrees, as infallibly true. But it is neceſſary to the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Peace,</hi> that all Churches ſhould be inveſted with a Power to bind their Members to outward ſubmiſſion in the Caſe aforeſaid; that is, when their ſuppoſed Errors are not of that Moment, as that 'tis of more pernicious Conſequence to bear with them, than to break the Peace of the Church by oppoſing them. And as to the fore-mentioned Subſcription that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> it is very Conſiſtent with Our Churches giving all Men Liberty to Judge for <hi>themſelves,</hi> and not Exerciſing Authority (as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church doth) over our <hi>Faith;</hi> for ſhe requires
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:466"/> no Man to <hi>believe</hi> thoſe Articles, but at worſt only thinks it Convenient that none ſhould receive <hi>Orders,</hi> or be admitted to Benefices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>ſuch</hi> as <hi>do</hi> believe them (not all as Articles of our <hi>Faith,</hi> but many as inferiour truths,) and requires Subſcription to them as a Teſt, whereby to Judge who <hi>doth</hi> ſo believe them. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires all under Pain of Damnation, to <hi>believe</hi> all her long Bed-roul of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which have only the Stamp of <hi>her</hi> Authority, and to believe them too as Articles of <hi>Faith;</hi> or to believe them with the <hi>ſame</hi> Divine Faith that we do the indiſputable Doctrines of our Saviour and his Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>For a proof hereof, the Reader may conſult the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius the Fourth,</hi> which is to be found at the End of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Herein it is Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Profeſſion of Faith ſhall be made and ſworn, by all Dignitaries, Prebendaries, and ſuch as have Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices with Cure, Military Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Form following:</p>

Alſo the Holy Scriptures according to the Senſe which our Holy Mother the Church hath held, and doth hold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I profeſs alſo that there are truly and properly Seven Sacraments of the New Law, inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and neceſſary to the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; although all are not neceſſary to every individual Perſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I alſo admit and receive the Received and approved Rites of the Catholick Church, in the</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:467"/> 
                           <hi>Solemn Adminiſtration of all the foreſaid Sacraments</hi> (of which I have given the Reader a taſte) <hi>I Embrace and Receive all and every thing which hath been declared and defined concerning</hi> Original Sin, <hi>and</hi> Juſtification <hi>in the Holy Synod of</hi> Trent. <hi>I likewiſe profeſs that in the Maſs, a True, Proper, and Propitiatory Sacrifice is Offered to God, for the quick and dead: And that the Body and Blood of Chriſt, is truly, really and ſubſtantially in the moſt Holy Euchariſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I alſo Confeſs that whole and intire Chriſt, and the true Sacrament, is received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of the kinds only. I conſtantly hold that there is a</hi> Purgatory, <hi>and that the Souls there detained are relieved by the Prayers of the Faithful. And in like manner that the Saints Reigning with Chriſt, are to be Worſhipped and Invoked,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that their Relicks are to be Worſhipped. I moſt firmly aſſert, that the Images of Chriſt, and of the Mother of God, always a Virgin, and of the other Saints, are to be had and kept, and that due Honour and Worſhip is to be given to them. I Affirm alſo, that the power of</hi> Indulgences <hi>is left by Chriſt in his Church, and that the uſe of them is very Salutiferous to Chriſtian People. I acknowledge the Holy Catholick and Apoſtolick</hi> Roman <hi>Church, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Miſtreſs of all Churches; and I Profeſs and Swear Obedience to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>the Succeſſor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>Prince of the Apoſtles, and the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt. Alſo all the other things delivered, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and declared by the Holy Canons, and Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Councils, and eſpecially by the Holy Synod of</hi> Trent, <hi>I undoubtedly receive and profeſs: As alſo all things contrary to theſe, and all Hereſies Condemned, Rejected and Anathematized by the Church, I, in like manner, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, Reject and Anathematize. This true Catholick Faith, (viz.</hi> all this Stuff of their own, together with the Articles of the Creed) <hi>without which no Man can be Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved,</hi>

                           <hi>which at this preſent I truly profeſs and ſincerely hold, I will, God Aſſiſting me, moſt conſtantly Retain and Confeſs intire and inviolate; and, as much as in me lies, will take Care, that it be held, taught and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by thoſe that are under me, or the Care of whom ſhall be committed to me; I the ſame</hi> N. <hi>do Profeſs, Vow and Swear; So help me God, and the Holy Goſpels of God.</hi> Who, when he Reads <hi>this,</hi> can forbear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a moſt Glorious <hi>Reformation?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the Motives our Church propoſeth for our belief of the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> viz. that that Doctrine is of Divine Revelation, they are no other than ſuch as are found in the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Excellency</hi> thereof, which conſiſts in its being wholly adapted to the reforming of mens Lives, and renewing their Natures after the Image of God; and the <hi>Miracles</hi> by which it is confirmed.

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> We proceed to ſhew, that a Churches Symbolizing, or agreeing in ſome things with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no Warrant for Separation from the Church ſo agreeing. Agreement with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in things either in their <hi>own nature good,</hi> or made ſo by a Divine Precept, none of our Diſſenting Brethren could ever imagine not to be an indiſpenſable duty: Agreement with her in what is <hi>in its own nature Evil,</hi> or made ſo by a Divine Prohibition, none of <hi>us</hi> are ſo forſaken of all Modeſty as to deny it to be an inexcuſable ſin. The Queſtion therefore is, whether to agree with this Apoſtate Church, in ſome things of an <hi>indifferent</hi> nature, be a Sin, and therefore a juſt ground for Separation from the Church ſo agreeing. But, by the way, if we ſhould ſuppoſe that a Churches agreeing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſome indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things is ſinful, I cannot think that any of the more Sober Sort of Diſſenters (and I deſpair of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in arguing with any but ſuch) will thence infer, that Separation from the Church ſo agreeing is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe warrantable, than upon the account of thoſe things being impoſed as <hi>neceſſary terms of Communion.</hi> But I am ſo far from taking it for granted, that a Church is guilty of Sin in agreeing in ſome indifferent things with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I muſt needs profeſs, I have often wondred how <hi>this</hi> ſhould become a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Seeing whatſoever is of an indifferent nature, as it is not <hi>Commanded,</hi> ſo neither is it <hi>Forbidden</hi> by any Moral or Poſitive Law; and <hi>where there is no Law,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there is no tranſgreſſion; Sin</hi> being, according to <hi>his</hi> definition, <hi>the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> And whereas certain <hi>Circumſtances</hi> will make things that in <hi>themſelves</hi> are neither <hi>duties</hi> nor <hi>ſins,</hi> to be either duties or ſins, and to fall by <hi>Conſequence</hi> under ſome Divine Command or Prohibition; I have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:468"/> admired how <hi>this</hi> Circumſtance of <hi>an indifferent thing's being uſed by the Church of Rome</hi> can be thought to alter the Nature of that thing, and make it ceaſe to be indifferent and become ſinful. But that it doth ſo, is endeavoured to be proved by that general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of <hi>imitating the doings of the</hi> Aegyptians <hi>and</hi> Canaanites, in thoſe Words, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>After the doings of the Land of</hi> Aegypt <hi>wherein ye dwell, ſhall ye not do, and after the doings of the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>whither I bring you, ſhall ye not do, neither ſhall ye walk in their Ordinances.</hi> This place divers of the Defenders of Nonconformity have laid great weight upon, as a proof of the Sinfulneſs of Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Even in indifferent things. But I chuſe to forbear the <hi>Naming</hi> of any whoſe Arguings I purpoſe to inquire into, becauſe I would prevent (if it be poſſible) the leaſt ſuſpition in the Readers, that I deſign in this Performance to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Mans weakneſs in <hi>particular,</hi> or that I am therein Acted by any <hi>Perſonal</hi> Piques.</p>
                        <p>Now then, as to the Text now Cited; not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the Fallaciouſneſs of Arguing, without mighty caution, from Laws given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo as to infer the Obligation of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are under a diſpenſation ſo different from theirs, and in Circumſtances ſo vaſtly differing from thoſe <hi>they</hi> were in; I ſay, not to inſiſt upon the Fallaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this way of Arguing, (which all conſidering Perſons muſt needs be aware of) if <hi>this</hi> general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition be not at all to be limited, then it will follow from thence, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might have no uſages <hi>whatſoever</hi> in common with the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> or <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites;</hi> and therefore, in as <hi>general</hi> terms as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition runs, our Brethren muſt needs acknowledge that there is a reſtriction therein intended: it being
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:469"/> the moſt abſurd thing to imagine, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſo bound up by God, as to be Obliged to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſs to thoſe People in <hi>all</hi> their Actions: For, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if they were never to Company with Wicked Men, <hi>they muſt needs go out of the World, we</hi> may ſay of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in reference to <hi>this</hi> Caſe of theirs, <hi>they</hi> then <hi>muſt needs have gone out of the World.</hi> Now if this general Prohibition, <hi>After their doings ye ſhall not do,</hi> be to be limited and reſtrained, what way have we to do it, but by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Context, and confining the reſtriction to thoſe Particulars Prohibited in the <hi>following</hi> verſes? But I need not ſhew that the particulars forbidden in all theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>v. 5th.</hi> to the <hi>24th.</hi> were not things of an <hi>indifferent</hi> Nature, but <hi>Inceſtuous Copulations, and other abominable Acts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs.</hi> And God doth <hi>Expreſly</hi> enough thus reſtrain that general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, in the <hi>24th v.</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>Defile not your ſelves in any of theſe things, for in all theſe the Nations are Defiled, which I caſt out before you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But thoſe that alledge this Text to the foreſaid purpoſe, will not hear of the general Propoſition's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus limited by the Context; (as apparent as it is, that it neceſſarily muſt) becauſe, ſay they, we find that God forbids the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>other</hi> places to imitate <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> in things of an <hi>Indifferent</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> Nature.</p>
                        <p>To this I Anſwer, Firſt, That ſuppoſing this were ſo, it doth not from thence follow, that God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forbid ſuch imitations in <hi>this</hi> place, the <hi>contrary</hi> being ſo manifeſt as we have ſeen. But,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God hath any where prohibited the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to Symbolize with <hi>Heathens,</hi> in things of a meer Indifferent and Innocent Nature; I mean, that he hath made it unlawful to them, to obſerve any ſuch Cuſtoms of the Heathens, meerly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:469"/> of their being <hi>like them,</hi> is a very great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake: Which will appear by conſidering thoſe places which are produced for it. One is, Deut. 14. 1. <hi>You ſhall not Cut your ſelves, nor make any baldneſs between your Eyes for the dead.</hi> Now, as to the <hi>former</hi> of theſe prohibited things, who ſeeth not that 'tis <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> and therefore not indifferent? And as to the <hi>latter,</hi> viz. the disfiguring of themſelves by Cutting off their Eyebrows, this was not meerly an indifferent thing neither: It being a Cuſtom at Funerals much disbecoming the People of God, which would make them look, <hi>as if they ſorrowed for the dead as Men without hope.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another place inſiſted upon for the ſame purpoſe, is <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not let thy Cattle-Gender with a divers kind, thou ſhalt not ſow thy ground with ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſeed, nor ſhall a Garment of Linnen and Woollen come upon thee.</hi> Now theſe <hi>three,</hi> 'tis ſaid, are things of ſo indifferent a Nature, that none can be more indifferent. I anſwer, 'Tis readily granted. But where is it ſaid, that theſe things were forbidden becauſe the <hi>Heathens</hi> uſed them? <hi>Maimonides</hi> indeed (as I learn from <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius)</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> uſed theſe mixtures of <hi>Seeds,</hi> and of <hi>Linnen and Woollen</hi> in many of their Magical Exploits; but 'tis univerſally acknowledged that <hi>theſe</hi> things, among <hi>many</hi> other, were forbidden to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Myſtical inſtructions in Moral Duties.</p>
                        <p>I have found no other Text made uſe of to prove meer indifferent things to have been forbidden the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> only in regard of <hi>Heathens</hi> uſing them, which make more for this purpoſe than theſe <hi>two</hi> do, nor hardly another that makes ſo much. But if there were never ſo many, it is not worth our while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ourſelves now with them, becauſe, though we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:470"/> ſhould ſuppoſe a great number of inſtances of ſuch things as were forbidden thoſe People, for no other reaſon, but becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> or <hi>Canaanites</hi> uſed them, yet this would ſignifie nothing to the proving Our Churches Symbolizing with that of <hi>Rome</hi> in indifferent things to be Unlawful, becauſe there is not the like reaſon, why in ſuch things we may not Symbolize with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that there was why the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be forbidden to Symbolize in ſuch with thoſe Heathens. For there could not be too great a diſtance and unlikeneſs between <hi>thoſe</hi> People and <hi>theſe</hi> in their uſages, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ſtrangely Vehement inclination to their Superſtitious and Idolatrous Practices. And upon this account, the diſtance was made wider (as our Brethren themſelves will acknowledge) between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Pagans,</hi> than it ought to be between <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> and them, or between Proteſtants and Papiſts. And we find that the diſtance that God made between the Jews and Heathens, as very wide as it was, was not wide enough to preſerve the <hi>Jews</hi> from being very often (and that generally too) infected with their Superſtitions, and various kinds of Idolatry: No, though they frequently paid moſt dear for theſe their Wicked Imitations of them. But, thanks be to God, there is no ſuch inclination in the Members of <hi>Our</hi> Church to go over to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor hath any ſuch inclination been obſerv'd ever ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And where <hi>one</hi> of our Communion hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted out of Love to Popery, (of thoſe few Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively who have play'd the Apoſtates) we have cauſe to believe that <hi>many</hi> have ſo done meerly upon the ſcore of intereſt. And I need not ſay, that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would not have been preſerved from Apoſtaſie, by our Churches being ſet at the wideſt diſtance poſſible from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in indifferent things. Nay 'tis
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:470"/> ſo far from being true, that there is a general incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in our Proteſtants to Popery, that nothing is better known, or hath of late been more obſerved, than the greateſt Antipathy and Averſation thereto i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable in the generality. Upon which account, I ſay, the foreſaid and the like Prohibitions to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation (although they ſhould be underſtood in the ſence of our Diſſenting Brethren) can by no parity of reaſon be obliging to us Proteſtant Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>And indeed moſt of them have ſeemed of late years to be pretty well aware of this, and therefore divers of their Writers have limited the unlawfulneſs of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing with the Romiſh Church, to things that have been <hi>abuſed notoriouſly, in Idolatrous and groſly Superſtitious Services.</hi> And that our Symbolizing with that Church in any <hi>ſuch</hi> things is Unlawful, they endeavour to demonſtrate both by Scripture-Precepts and Examples.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> They endeavour to demonſtrate this by Scripture-Precepts. And if any ſuch Precept as <hi>this</hi> could be produced, <hi>That all ſuch things as have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly abuſed and Polluted in Idolatrous or groſly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious ſervices, ſhould by all be aboliſhed and laid aſide,</hi> there could be no place left for diſpute about this matter; and I doubt not but <hi>we</hi> ſhould all of us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs as great Zeal, as our Brethren do, for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of all ſuch things. But no ſuch expreſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Precept is pretended, but the chief of thoſe Texts from whence our Brethren endeavour to Infer this Propoſition, <hi>That it is the will of God, that all things ſo polluted ſhould be utterly deſtroyed and laid aſide,</hi> are <hi>theſe</hi> following: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo the covering of thy Graven Images of Silver, and the Ornament of thy Molten Images of Gold: Thou ſhalt Caſt them away as a Menſtruous Cloath, thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:471"/>
                        <p>Deut. 7. 25, 26. <hi>The Graven Images of their Gods ſhall ye burn with Fire; thou ſhalt not deſire the Silver or Gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, leſt thou be ſnared therein: for it is an Abomination to the Lord thy God. Neither ſhalt thou bring an Abomination into thy Houſe, leſt thou be a curſed thing like it; but thou ſhalt utterly deteſt it, and thou ſhalt utterly abhor it, for it is a Curſed thing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Jude 23.<hi>—hating even the Garment ſpotted with the Fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Revel. 2. 14. <hi>I have a few things againſt thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt there them that hold the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam, <hi>who taught</hi> Balac <hi>to caſt a Stumbling block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Children of Iſrael, to Eat things Sacrificed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idols,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>Notwithſtanding I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that Woman</hi> Jezebel, <hi>which calleth her ſelf a Propheteſs, to teach and to ſeduce my Servants to commit Fornication, and to Eat things Sacrificed to Idols.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to their alledging of theſe Texts to prove the foreſaid Propoſition, I reply:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>laſt</hi> of them is altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. For <hi>the eating of things offered to Idols</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in thoſe two verſes, is nothing better than joyning and complying with Idolaters, and Communicating in Idol-worſhips. Which the vile Gnoſtiques held they might do (and accordingly practiſed this Doctrine) to avoid Perſecution: Which abominable Sect aroſe in the Church (as we learn from <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Euſebius, &amp;c.)</hi> even in the Apoſtles times, of which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was the firſt Founder. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath given us his Judgment concerning Eating of things offered to Idols, without any reſpect to Idols in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 <hi>chap. viz.</hi> That upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but that of <hi>Scandal</hi> it is unlawful.</p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:471"/>
                        <p>And the like he hath done, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27, 28, 29. <hi>If any of them that believe not bid you to a Feaſt, and you be diſpoſed to go, whatſoever is ſet before you, Eat, making no queſtion for Conſcience ſake. But if any man ſay unto you, This is offered in Sacrifice unto Idols, Eat not, for his ſake who ſhewed it, and for Conſcience ſake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Conſcience I ſay not thine own, but of the others: For why is my liberty judged of another mans Conſcience?</hi> That is, ſo as to make a thing indifferent in it ſelf, <hi>ſimply</hi> unlawful to me. But the ſtating of this caſe of <hi>Scandal</hi> is the buſineſs of <hi>anothers</hi> Pen, to which I refer thoſe who need ſatisfaction in this matter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to thoſe words of St. <hi>Jude—hating even the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh:</hi> Nothing more can poſſibly be gathered from them, than what <hi>we</hi> and all Chriſtians muſt acknowledge, as well as our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, viz.</hi> that we ought to be as Cautious of expoſing our ſelves unneceſſarily to temptations to ſin, as we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are of touching the Garments of infected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But if the Text had run <hi>thus—hating even the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was once ſpotted with the Fleſh,</hi> or once fouled with a Plague-Sore, though it be never ſo well cleanſed from infection, <hi>then</hi> I muſt confeſs it would be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our Brethrens purpoſe, we could make no reply to.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the two places cited out of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, <hi>they</hi> indeed not only ſerve to prove, that it was God's will that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould deſtroy <hi>Idols,</hi> but alſo the Appurtenances of them. And the reaſon of theſe Precepts being given to thoſe People hath already been ſhewed, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they were ſo ſtrangely, ſo <hi>prodigiouſly</hi> addicted to the Superſtitions and Idolatry of their Heathen-Neighbours. But if theſe and the like places ſhould really make for our Brethrens deſign in Citing them, and do prove that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are obliged
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:472"/> to deſtroy, or caſt away, all things notoriouſly defiled in groſly Superſtitious and Idolatrous ſervices, they would certainly prove <hi>more,</hi> than the more ſober ſort of Diſſenters do deſire they ſhould. For they do not object againſt the lawfulneſs of our uſing the <hi>Churches,</hi> or <hi>Fonts,</hi> or <hi>Bells,</hi> which heretofore were moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſo defiled by the Papiſts. But if theſe Texts ſpeak it to be the duty of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as well as <hi>Jews</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all ſuch things, then 'tis manifeſt that down we muſt with all our Old <hi>Churches, &amp;c.</hi> or we are guilty of an inexcuſable violation of the Divine Law. And to except ſuch things as theſe, after they have Evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from ſuch Scriptures our obligation to deſtroy all things notoriouſly polluted in groſly Superſtitious and Idolatrous Services, ſeems to be making too too bold with the expreſs Laws of God, which make no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, nor doth the forementioned reaſon of them imply any ſuch. And therefore they have been high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned for making ſuch like exceptions, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their Brethren who have Attained to a higher diſpenſation. And conſidering this Conceſſion that ſuch things as the fore-named may ſtill be lawfully uſed, as alſo the Conceſſions of a nameleſs Author in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Book call'd <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> that <hi>no Creature of God is to be refuſed, nor any neceſſary or profitable devices of men need be ſent packing upon the account of their having been much abuſed to the foreſaid ends;</hi> I appeal to their own more ſedate thoughts, whether all that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſuch Scriptures is any more than <hi>this,</hi> that things ſo abuſed ought to be deſtroyed or aboliſhed, by all who have power to do it, in <hi>ſome certain caſe or caſes,</hi> and not merely for this reaſon, <hi>becauſe they have been ſo abuſed. This,</hi> I preſume, none of <hi>us</hi> will deny; and if <hi>they</hi> will acknowledge it, as they muſt do if they will ſtand to thoſe their Conceſſions, they will be Conſtrained to give up this Cauſe.</p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:472"/>
                        <p>I will conclude the Argument in hand with the judgment of that Eminent Reformer Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> whoſe Authority goes farther with the generality of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, than, I think, any <hi>Mans</hi> next to the Apoſtles. Saith he upon the <hi>Second Commandment, I know that the</hi> Jews, <hi>throughout the time of their</hi> Paedagogy, <hi>were Commanded to deſtroy the Groves and Altars of Idolaters, not by vertue of the</hi> Moral <hi>Law, but by an Appendix in the</hi> Judicial <hi>or</hi> Politick <hi>Law, which did oblige that People for a time only, but it binds not Chriſtians: And therefore we do not in the leaſt ſcruple whether we may Lawfully uſe thoſe Temples, Fonts, and other Materials, which have been heretofore abuſed to Idolatrous and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious uſes. I acknowledge indeed, that we ought to remove ſuch things as ſeem to nouriſh Idolatry, upon ſuppoſition that we our ſelves in oppoſing too violently things in their own Nature indifferent, be not too Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious. It is equally Superſtitious to Condemn things indifferent as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy, and to Command them as if they were Holy.</hi> Thus you ſee Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> ſenſe agreeth exactly with <hi>Ours,</hi> touching this Point of Controverſie between us and many of our Diſſenting Brethren.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> They endeavour alſo to make out this Doctrine of theirs by Scripture <hi>Examples.</hi> There are four or five of theſe Examples inſiſted upon, but I will trouble the Reader with conſidering only <hi>one</hi> of them; both becauſe it is the Principal Example, and that which they lay moſt ſtreſs on; and becauſe the Reply I ſhall make to <hi>this,</hi> will be as ſatisfactory in reference to the reſt. It is that of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his breaking in pieces the Brazen Serpent that <hi>Moſes</hi> had made, becauſe the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> burnt Incenſe to it, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. Now, ſaith a certain Noted Author, <hi>What Example is more conſiderable than that of</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>who not only abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſuch Monuments of Idolatry, as at their firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:473"/> 
                           <hi>were but Men's inventions, but brake down alſo the Brazen Serpent (though Originally ſet up at Gods Command) when once he ſaw it abuſed to Idolatry.</hi> And he adds, that this deed of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Pope <hi>Stephen doth greatly Praiſe</hi> (citing <hi>Wolphius</hi> for it) <hi>and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that it is ſet before us for our imitation; that when our Predeceſſors have wrought ſome things, which might have been without fault in their time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they are converted into Error and Superſtition, they may be quickly deſtroyed by us who come after them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which ſoever of the <hi>Stephens</hi> this was, he was a ſtrangely Honeſt <hi>Pope;</hi> eſpecially had he <hi>Practiſed</hi> according to <hi>this</hi> his Profeſſion, and his Infallibility<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had judg'd <hi>Impartially</hi> of Errors and Superſtitions. And he cites <hi>Farellus</hi> (out of an Epiſtle of <hi>Calvins)</hi> for this ſaying, <hi>That Princes and Magiſtrates</hi> ſhould <hi>learn by this Example of</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>what they</hi> ſhould <hi>do with thoſe ſignificant Rites of Mens deviſing which have turned to Superſtition.</hi> And he farther adds, <hi>that the Biſhop of</hi> Wincheſter, <hi>(in his Sermon on</hi> Phil. 2. 10.) <hi>acknowledgeth, that whatſoever is taken up at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Men, when it is drawn to Superſtition, cometh under the Compaſs of the Brazen Serpent, and is to be aboliſhed.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>he Excepteth nothing from this Example, but only things of Gods own Preſcribing.</hi> But 'tis ſtrange if a <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhould not except <hi>Churches,</hi> and ſome other things beſides which are of an humane make; and as ſtrange if there be nothing going before or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this acknowledgment, to lead us to a better underſtanding of it. We will not queſtion our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors faithfulneſs in Tranſcribing it, but wiſh he had told us <hi>which</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> this is, and in what <hi>page</hi> of his Sermon we might find this Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:473"/>
                        <p>But that this Fact of King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> will not prove, that whatſoever hath been notoriouſly defiled in Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous or groſly Superſtitious Services ought to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and much leſs, that the not aboliſhing ſome ſuch things is a good ground for Separation from the Church that neglects ſo to do, will, I preſume, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear by theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Brazen Serpent was not only a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in Idolatrous Services, but it was made an <hi>Idol it ſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was not only a thing that had <hi>once</hi> been made an Idol, or Object of Religious Worſhip, but it was Actually ſo at that time when it was deſtroyed. Nay, it was at that inſtant an Object of the <hi>moſt groſs</hi> kind of Idolatry: It being not only <hi>bowed down</hi> to, but had likewiſe <hi>Incenſe burnt</hi> to it; <hi>this</hi> being a Rite which is never uſed in meer <hi>Civil</hi> Worſhip, like <hi>bowing the Knee,</hi> &amp;c. but ſo proper and peculiar to <hi>Divine</hi> Worſhip, that no Rite is <hi>more</hi> ſo. Nay farther:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was not thus notoriouſly Idolized by ſome <hi>few</hi> of the People, but the People were <hi>generally</hi> lapſed into this Idolatry: As the Text plainly ſheweth. Nay:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There was as little hope as could be of the Peoples being reclaimed from this Idolatry, while the Idol was in being: Seeing that of a long time they had been accuſtomed thereunto. For 'tis ſaid, that <hi>unto thoſe days</hi> the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> burnt Incenſe to it; which ſpeaks it to have been not only a <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> but a Cuſtom alſo of a <hi>long ſtanding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Although it had been only <hi>a thing defiled in Idolatrous Services,</hi> yet we freely grant that it ought to have been deſtroyed, or removed from the Peoples ſight, if the continuance of it in their View were like to be a <hi>Snare</hi> to them, and a Temptation to Idolatry:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:474"/> Since now the uſe of it was ceaſed, for which, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment, it was firſt Erected. But there was no neceſſity for this, upon ſuppoſition that it had ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be abuſed for any conſiderable time, and there were no appearance of an inclination in the People to abuſe it again. And no doubt, all things of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature, that have formerly been abuſed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Superſtition, ought to be taken away by the Governours, whenſoever they find their People again inclined ſo to abuſe them; at leaſt, if ſuch abuſe cannot probably be prevented by <hi>other</hi> means.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> But had <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſuffered the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſtill to ſtand, no doubt private Perſons (who have no authority to make publick Reformations) might Lawfully have made uſe of it, to put them in mind of, and affect them with the wonderful mercy of God expreſſed by it to their Fore-Fathers; notwithſtanding that many, had not only formerly, but did at that very nick of time, make an Idol of it. And much more might they have Lawfully continued in the Communion of the Church, ſo long as there was no conſtraint laid upon <hi>them</hi> to joyn with them in their Idolatry: As we do not read of any that Separated from the Church while the Brazen Serpent was permitted to ſtand, as wofully abuſed as it was by the generality.</p>
                        <p>I will alſo conclude this Head with the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> concerning Rites uſed (and conſequently ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly abuſed) by the Papiſts, expreſſed in theſe Words; <hi>Let not any think me ſo auſtere, or bound up,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Calv.</hi> de vitandâ Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitione <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>as to forbid a Chriſtian without any exception, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the Papiſts in any Ceremony or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance: for it is not my purpoſe to Condemn any thing, but what is clearly Evil, and openly Vitious.</hi> To which may be added many other ſuch like ſayings of this Learned Perſon.</p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:474"/>
                        <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice to be diſcourſed upon our ſecond general Head, <hi>viz. That a Church's Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing in ſome things with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>is no Warrant for Separation from the Church ſo Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We now proceed, in the <hi>Third</hi> and laſt place, to ſhew, That the Agreement which is between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in no wiſe ſuch as will make Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> unlawful.</p>
                        <p>We have ſhewed, what a vaſtly wide Diſtance and Diſagreement there is between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and that of <hi>Rome:</hi> And we have ſufficiently (though with the greateſt brevity) made it apparent, that a Church's Symbolizing or agreeing in ſome things with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe ſuch too as ſhe hath abuſed in Idolatrous and groſly Superſtitious Services, is no juſt ground for Separation from the Church ſo agreeing; And we have anſwered the Chief of thoſe Arguments which have been brought for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the contrary Doctrine. And now, from what hath been diſcourſed, it may with the greateſt eaſe be prov'd, that <hi>thoſe</hi> things wherein our <hi>own</hi> Church particularly, agreeth with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, do none of them ſpeak ſuch an Agreement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as will juſtifie Separation from our Church's Communion.</p>
                        <p>Now the particulars wherein <hi>our</hi> Church Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which our Diſſenters take offence at, and make a pretence for Separation (though <hi>all</hi> Diſſenters are not offended at <hi>all</hi> of them, and much leſs ſo offended as to make them all a pretence for Separation) are principally <hi>theſe</hi> following.</p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:475"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Government of our Church by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhops.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Churches preſcribing a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or Set-Forms of Prayer, and Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and other Publick Offices.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Liturgy ſo contrived as that of our Church is.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Certain <hi>Rites</hi> of our Church. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the <hi>Surplice,</hi> the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Geſture of Kneeling at the Communion,</hi> the <hi>Ring in Marriage,</hi> and <hi>the Obſervation of certain Holy-days.</hi> And to all theſe I ſhall ſpeak very ſuccinctly, the limits I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to not permitting me to enlarge much upon any of them.</p>
                        <p>But I muſt firſt premiſe concerning them all in the general theſe following things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> That I take it for granted, that they are all indifferent in their <hi>own nature:</hi> That there is nothing of Viciouſneſs or Immorality in any of them to make them unlawful. I know no body ſo unreaſonable as not to grant this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is no <hi>Expreſs</hi> poſitive Law of God againſt any of theſe things. I do not know of any ſuch Law objected againſt any one of them. And therefore if all, or any of them are unlawful, they muſt be made ſo either by Conſequences drawn from Divine Laws, or certain Circumſtances attending them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That I am concerned in this Diſcourſe to vindicate them from being unlawful, upon the account onely of this <hi>one</hi> Circumſtance, <hi>viz. Our Symbolizing with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in them.</hi> Now then,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the Government of our Church by <hi>Biſhops: This</hi> is ſo far from being an <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful</hi> Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we have moſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:475"/> clear Evidence of its being a Symbolizing with her in an <hi>Apoſtolical Inſtitution.</hi> And what Eminent Divines of the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Party have acknowledg'd (and is too evident to be denied or <hi>doubted</hi> by any, who are not wholly ignorant of Church-Hiſtory) is ſufficient (I ſhould think) to ſatisfie unprejudiced perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of <hi>this:</hi> And <hi>that</hi> is, that <hi>this</hi> was the Government of all Churches in the World from the Apoſtles times, for about 1500 years together. <hi>Beza,</hi> in his Treatiſe of a <hi>Threefold kind of Epiſcopacy,</hi> Divine, Humane, and Satanical, aſſerts concerning the ſecond (which is that which we call Apoſtolical) <hi>that of this kind is to be underſtood whatſoever we read concerning the Authority of Biſhops,</hi> in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and other more Antient Writers. And the famous <hi>Peter Du Moulin,</hi> in his Book <hi>of the Paſtoral Office,</hi> written in defence of the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>preſently after the Apoſtles times, or even in their time (as Eccleſiaſtical ſtory witneſſeth) it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that in every City one of the Presbytery ſhould be called a Biſhop, who ſhould have preheminence over his Collegues; to avoid Confuſion, which oft times ariſeth out of Equality. And truly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment all Churches every where received.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Inſtitution of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus docendi munus injunctum erat, &amp;c. <hi>Thoſe to whom was committed the Office of Teaching, they called them all Presbyters. Theſe Elected out of their number in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">L. 4. cap. 4. §. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>each City one, to whom in a ſpecial manner they gave the Title of Biſhop; leſt Strife and Contention (as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happeneth) ſhould ariſe out of Equality.</hi> And in his Epiſtle to Arch-biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> he <hi>thus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſts him: <hi>Illuſtriſſime Domine, &amp; Ornatiſſime Praeſul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moſt Illuſtrious Sir, and moſt Honourable Prelate, and by me heartily Reverenced:</hi> And tells him, <hi>that</hi>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:476"/> 
                           <hi>if he might be ſerviceable to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>he would not think much of paſſing over ten Seas, for that purpoſe.</hi> Again, in his Epiſtle to the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he thus ſpeaks of <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Arch-biſhops; The Ancient Church did appoint Patriarchs and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in every Province, that by this bond of Concord the Biſhops might the better be knit together.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In ſhort, (for I muſt not proceed farther upon this vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly large head of diſcourſe) I know not how our Brethren will defend the Apoſtolical Inſtitution of the Obſervation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> while they contend that <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> cannot be concluded from the uninterrupted Tradition of the Catholick Church, for ſo many Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies from the time of the Apoſtles. Nor how thoſe that Separate from <hi>our</hi> Church upon the account of its <hi>Government by Biſhops,</hi> and call it Antichriſtian, can defend the Lawfulneſs of Communicating with any Church in Chriſtendom for about 1500 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>Our</hi> Churches preſcribing a <hi>Liturgy</hi> or <hi>ſet Forms of Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and other publick Offices;</hi> It is eaſie to ſhew that Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing with the Church of <hi>Rome herein</hi> is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing culpable, and much more from being a juſt ground of Separation from <hi>our</hi> Church, that 'tis highly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. For as herein our Church no leſs Symbolizeth with the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, than with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhe is now Conſtituted (nothing being more certainly known, than that Liturgies are of moſt Ancient ſtanding) ſo nothing is more highly expedient, for the due management of the publick Worſhip of God, than the uſe of a Liturgy. And, indeed, inſtead of <hi>Expedient</hi> I might ſay <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> it being impoſſible to ſecure the performance of publick Worſhip with that ſolemnity and gravity that becomes it, in a Church
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:476"/> where its Miniſters are wholly left free to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Extemporary invention. But the handling of <hi>this</hi> Argument is the buſineſs of another new Diſcourſe, to which I refer the Reader. I ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it with a citation out of <hi>Calvins</hi> Epiſtle <hi>Ad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorem Angliae;</hi> ſaith he; <hi>As to a Form of Prayers and Eccleſiaſtical Rites, I do very much approve of the publiſhing of a fixed one, from which it may not be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Paſtors to depart in the exerciſe of their Function: Thereby to provide againſt the ſimplicity and unskilfulneſs of ſome, and that the conſent of all the Churches with each other may more certainly appear: And laſtly, to put a barr to the skipping Levity of others, who Affect certain innovations. And therefore</hi> (as he proceeds) Statum eſſe Catechiſmum oportet, Statam Sacramentorum Adminiſtrationem, publicam item precum Formulam, <hi>there ought to be an Eſtabliſhed Catechiſm, an Office for the Adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments Eſtabliſht, and alſo a Publick Form of Prayers.</hi> And he accordingly compoſed a Liturgy, to be uſed by the Miniſters in <hi>Geneva,</hi> on Sundays and Holydays. And the Exiles that reſided at <hi>Geneva,</hi> in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> did by his advice draw up a Liturgy, which was Printed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, in the year 1556.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to a Liturgy <hi>ſo contrived</hi> as that of <hi>our</hi> Church is, what hath been ſaid of the vaſt diſtance between <hi>our</hi> Church and that of <hi>Rome</hi> herein, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſhew that there can be no warrantable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for Separation from <hi>our</hi> Church, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Symbolizing that is between theſe two Churches in <hi>this</hi> particular. But we will <hi>perticularly</hi> conſider thoſe inſtances of agreement between <hi>ours</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Service which are moſt offenſive to our Brethren; they are eſpecially theſe four.</p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:477"/>
                        <p n="1">1. Our many ſhort Prayers, which ſome have too lighly called <hi>ſhort Cuts, and Shreddings, and rather Wiſhes than Prayers.</hi> But there needs no other reply hereunto, than <hi>that</hi> our Learned <hi>Hooker</hi> gives, <hi>viz.</hi> That St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 121. <hi>That the Brethren in</hi> Aegypt <hi>are reported to have many Prayers, but every of them very ſhort, as if they were Darts thrown out with a kind of ſudden quickneſs, leſt that Vigilant and erect attention of mind, which in Prayer is very neceſſary, ſhould be Waſted and dulled through Continuance, if their Prayers were few and long. But that which St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>alloweth, they Condemn,</hi> &amp;c. He might as well have ſaid, What that good Father <hi>Commendeth;</hi> nay his words imply <hi>no ſmall</hi> commendation. And I fear not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all Pious Souls, who without prejudice joyn with us in our Publick Prayers, whether they find the ſhortneſs of many of them an <hi>hindrance</hi> or <hi>help</hi> to their Devotion. I don't queſtion but that ſuch will readily acknowledge that they find it an <hi>help.</hi> And therefore, in my weak judgment, our Symbolizing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular, is Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing with her in that which is highly commendable, as 'tis ſo alſo in <hi>that</hi> wherein <hi>ſhe</hi> Symbolizeth with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ancient Churches.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another inſtance is, <hi>The Peoples bearing a part with the Miniſter in Divine Service.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſaid enough in his <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> on Q. 83. not only to vindicate the <hi>Lawfulneſs,</hi> but the <hi>Fitneſs and Expediency</hi> alſo, of Symbolizing herein with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Saith he,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Scripture no where forbids it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>If the People may do this in the Pſalms in Metre, there can be no reaſon given, but they may Lawfully do it in Proſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:477"/>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The Primitive Chriſtians were ſo full of Zeal and Love of Chriſt, that they would have taken it for an injury, or quenching of the Spirit, to have been wholly reſtrained from bearing a part in the Praiſes of the Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>The uſe of the Tongue keeps awake the Mind, and ſtirs up Gods graces in his Servants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>It was the decay of Zeal in the People, that firſt ſhut out the Reſponſes: while they kept up the Ancient Zeal, they were inclined to take their part vocally in the Worſhip.</hi> Though I were under no obligation of brevity, I ſhould add nothing more of mine own about this matter.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Another inſtance of this Nature is, <hi>the taking of ſome of the Collects out of the Maſs-Book.</hi> But to <hi>this</hi> I give this, I hope as <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> as <hi>ſhort</hi> Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Prayers are either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad:</hi> if they are <hi>bad</hi> ones, they may not be uſed, though they were <hi>not</hi> in the Maſs-Book; and upon <hi>that</hi> account the uſe of them would be Unlawful, not upon the account of our <hi>Symbolizing in them with the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> But if they are all <hi>good</hi> ones, as they are <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> good, then from what hath been ſaid, 'tis Evident that <hi>this</hi> Symbolizing cannot make them <hi>bad;</hi> and 'tis a hard caſe that we ſhould not be allowed the uſe of whatſoever is <hi>good</hi> in their Service. Our Brethren will allow of reading the ſame <hi>Scriptures</hi> that <hi>they</hi> do, and why then ſhould they diſallow of uſing what perfectly <hi>agreeth</hi> with Scripture, becauſe they uſe it? Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>them</hi> was deſigned to be a <hi>Reformation,</hi> not a total <hi>Deſtruction</hi> and <hi>Extirpation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The laſt inſtance is, <hi>The appointing of Leſſons out of the Apocryphal Books.</hi> But herein we Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, rather than with this of <hi>Rome:</hi> For (as hath been ſhewed out of the 6. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:478"/> of our Church) they are not appointed to be read as <hi>Canonical</hi> Scripture; and we perfectly agree with the Primitive Church, in reading them <hi>for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Life, and inſtruction of Manners, but not for the Eſtabliſhing of any Doctrine:</hi> Which, in <hi>that</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is ſhewed from St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> to have been the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that Church. And beſides, they are not now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be ordinarily on <hi>Sundays</hi> read in Our Churches.</p>
                        <p>Theſe I take to be the chief of thoſe inſtances of <hi>our</hi> Churches Symbolizing with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Compoſure of the Liturgy, that Our Diſſenters are offended at: And as for their other Objections of this kind, they are as eaſily anſwered. And I moſt ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs, that 'tis not to me imaginable that any thing better than Extreme prejudice can make any Man a Separatiſt from Our Communion upon ſuch accounts as theſe: As alſo, that I cannot underſtand how any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and pious Souls that come to our Publick Prayers without prejudice, can find themſelves in the leaſt tempted not to joyn in them heartily with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Abſolute perfection is not to be expected in any thing of a human make; but if all would read Our Liturgy with that Candour they uſe in reading the Books of thoſe they have a good opinion of, as I am ſure they could think nothing <hi>intolerable</hi> therein, ſo am I as ſure, they would freely acknowledge it to be exceedingly well adapted to the deſign of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the exciting of Devotion, and that good temper of mind, that is neceſſary to Our Worſhipping of God <hi>in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> I am certain, the experience of very many as excellent Chriſtians as this Age can <hi>boaſt</hi> of, do bear me witneſs, that this is no laviſh commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Our Prayers. Dr. <hi>Tayler</hi> that bleſſed Martyr
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:478"/> gave this Teſtimony to Our Liturgy: <hi>There was ſet</hi>

I mean of that Book Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> What then would he have thought of it, had he lived to ſee it twice more Reformed, as it hath been ſince?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I proceed to the fore-named <hi>Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of Our Church, in which Our Symbolizing with Popery is ſo much Condemned, and made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for Separation. But before I come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I will obſerve in the general, that the diſtance Our Church keeps from that of <hi>Rome</hi> in the impoſition of Ceremonies, is infinitely greater than her Agreement therein with her. For, as thoſe impoſed by <hi>our</hi> Church (as hath been already ſaid) are exceeding few, not the <hi>hundredth</hi> part ſcarcely of thoſe impoſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſo doth not <hi>our Church</hi> impoſe them (as the other doth) on the Conſciences of her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as things of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> as <hi>parts</hi> of Religion or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Services, as hath been proved out of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Now then,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Surplice,</hi> our Church requires not the wearing of <hi>this</hi> Garment, as an Holy Veſtment, like the Prieſtly Garments under the Old Law, but meerly for the ſake of Order and Uniformity: whereas in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a Surplice may not be worn till 'tis
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:479"/> hallowed in a ſolemn manner by the Biſhop, or ſome one by his Allowance (as may be ſeen in the <hi>Miſſal)</hi> with divers Prayers, that it may defend him who wears it from the Aſſaults of the Devil; the Prayers being accompanied with a number of Croſſings, and, in fine, the Surplice beſprinkled with Holy Water, in the Name of the Bleſſed Trinity. But, I ſay, in <hi>our</hi> Church 'tis uſed only as a Garment of diſtinction; no more holineſs is placed in it, than in the <hi>Hoods</hi> worn over it meerly for diſtinction of degrees: And the <hi>White</hi> is preferred before any other Colour, becauſe it was a very antient Cuſtom in the Primitive Church for the Miniſters to Officiate in White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith of the Surplice, <hi>Theſe linnen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>

                           <hi>we do not ſo ſtick at, that we would have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Word of God hindred in the leaſt for them.</hi> And we might ſhew that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> much blamed contending with Authority about the wearing this Garment: Particularly in his Epiſtle to <hi>Bullinger.</hi> And ſince all the Popiſh abuſe of this Garment is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly removed, I know not why all Miniſters ſhould not be of <hi>their</hi> mind; and much leſs can I imagine, why thoſe who are not obliged to <hi>wear</hi> it, ſhould be affrighted from our Churches by the meer <hi>ſight</hi> of ſo Innocent a thing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm; Our Church holds ſo little Conformity with the Papiſts herein, that in no one thing of an Indifferent nature can our Symbolizing with them be leſs ſcandalous. Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> in <hi>his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of</hi> Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> Sheweth, that <hi>we hold no Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Papiſts in</hi> the uſe thereof, either in the <note place="margin">P. 416. &amp;c.</note>

The Miniſter with us (as he there ſheweth) may not Croſs <hi>Himſelf,</hi> or the <hi>People,</hi> or <hi>Font, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Communion-Table,</hi> or <hi>Cups,</hi> or the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi>
                           <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:479"/> or any <hi>other</hi> of Gods Ordinances: All which in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Prieſt is bound to do, for their Conſecration, or bleſſing of <hi>himſelf,</hi> or <hi>them,</hi> as without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Conſecrated. The Child to be Baptized with <hi>us,</hi> may not be Croſſed before Baptiſm on the <hi>Forehead, Breaſt,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> part; which in Popery, the Prieſt muſt do, to drive away the Devil, and make the Efficacy of that Sacrament more eaſy and ſtrong, as they teach. After Baptiſm, the Miniſter may not with <hi>us</hi> Croſs the Children <hi>with</hi> Oyl or Chriſm, or <hi>without,</hi> on the Crown of the Head, as in Popery is required, to give them their full Chriſtendom, leſt they ſhould die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Confirmation.</hi> Yea at <hi>Confirmation,</hi> the Miniſter is not to make the ſign of the Croſs on the Forehead <hi>with</hi> Chriſm or <hi>without,</hi> which is enjoyned in Popery as an Eſſential part of the Sacrament (as they call it) of <hi>Confirmation.</hi> Nay (as he proceeds) if the Child be in danger of preſent death, and not like to live to make profeſſion of Chriſt Crucified, the Miniſter is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected not to uſe the ſign of the Croſs; that all may know, that we hold it not to be either Operative upon the Child, or at all neceſſary to the Efficacy of the Lord's Sacrament, but do onely retain it, according to the firſt and beſt intention, as an outward badg of the Conſtant profeſſion of Chriſt Crucified. And whereas 'tis ſaid in the 30 <hi>Canon,</hi> that <hi>by this lawful Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and honorable badg, this Child is dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> declareth that he hath good warrant to aſſure thoſe who are offended at that Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that the word <hi>dedicated</hi> doth there import no more, than <hi>declared</hi> by that Ceremony to be <hi>dedicated, viz.</hi> by the foregoing Baptiſm: like as the Prieſt is ſaid to have <hi>cleanſed</hi> the Leper, whom he onely <hi>declareth</hi> to be clean, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 11. And 'tis manifeſt from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of the impoſing of this Ceremony in that

                           <hi>Canon,</hi> that this Phraſe cannot otherwiſe be underſtood. I ſhall not need to add any thing more about <hi>this</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, after I have ſaid, that our Church retains it not in imitation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, they thereby</hi> (to uſe the Words of the foreſaid <hi>Canon) making an outward profeſſion even to the aſtoniſhment of the Jews, that they were not aſhamed to acknowledge</hi> him <hi>for their Lord and Saviour, who died for them upon the</hi> Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And (as it follows) <hi>this uſe of the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, was held in the Primitive Church, as well by the</hi> Greeks, <hi>as the</hi> Latins, <hi>with one conſent and great applauſe,</hi> &amp;c. I conclude with <hi>Beza</hi>'s judgment of the Lawfulneſs of <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reſp. ad</hi> Baldw. p. 324.</note> this Ceremony. Saith he, <hi>I know many too have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uſe of the Sign of the Croſs, the Adoration of the Croſs being taken away: Let them, as is meet, uſe their own Liberty.</hi> But in <hi>our</hi> Church, not onely the <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the Croſs, but likewiſe all <hi>Superſtition</hi> in the uſe of it, is perfectly aboliſhed. How then can it be thought ſuch a Symbolizing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as may warrant Separation from our Communion?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As to the Ceremony of <hi>Kneeling at the Communion:</hi> If our Churches Declaration at the end of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Service, will not vindicate her from an Unlawful Symbolizing with <hi>Rome</hi> herein, I have nothing to ſay in her defence. The declaration is <hi>this: Whereas it is ordained in this Office for the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, that the Communicants ſhould receive the ſame Kneeling (which order is well meant, for a ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our humble and grateful acknowledgment of the benefits of Chriſt, therein given to all worthy Receivers, and for the avoiding of ſuch Prophanation and diſorder in the Holy Communion, as might otherwiſe enſue) yet leſt the ſame Kneeling ſhould by any Perſons, either out of Ignorance and Infirmity, or out of Malice and Obſtinacy,</hi>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:480"/> 
                           <hi>be miſconſtrued and depraved; It is here declared, that thereby no Adoration is intended, or ought to be done, either unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine, there bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily received, or unto any Corporal-Preſence of Chriſt's Natural Fleſh and Blood: For the Sacramental Bread and Wine remain ſtill in their very Natural ſubſtances, and therefore may not be adored, (for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Chriſtians) And the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body and Blood of our Saviour Chriſt are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not here; it being againſt the truth of Chriſts Natural Body, to be at one time in more places than one.</hi> We ſee that our Church doth here, not only declare that no Adoration is in this Geſture intended, either to the Elements or to Chriſt's Corporal Preſence under the Species of Bread and Wine; but alſo that, as ſuch a Pretence is abſurd and contradictions, ſo the adoring of the Sacramental Bread and Wine, <hi>would be Idolatry to be abhorred by all faithful Chriſtians.</hi> So that, as nothing is in it ſelf more indifferent than <hi>this Geſture</hi> in receiving the Holy Communion, there being not one Word ſaid of the Geſture in our Saviours Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Sacrament, either before his Death to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> or after his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (who hath delivered to us what he received of the Lord about this matter, as he ſaid, that is, <hi>all</hi> that he had received) and as Chriſt hath Conſequently leſt the <hi>particular</hi> Geſture to the determination of the Church, a Geſture being in the <hi>general</hi> neceſſary; ſo this Circumſtance of <hi>Symbolizing with the Church of Rome</hi> herein, cannot make Our Churches requiring <hi>Kneeling</hi> to be Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (and much leſs our Obedience to the Church in uſing this Geſture) ſeeing all the Idolatry and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> too, wherewith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath abuſed it, is perfectly removed, and 'tis required by our Church meerly as a decent Reverend Geſture.</p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:481"/>
                        <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>Ring in Marriage:</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as is to be ſeen in the Office of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> juxta uſum Eccleſiae <hi>Sarisburienſis)</hi> abuſeth it moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly. There you have it, firſt bleſſed with <hi>two Prayers;</hi> in the <hi>former</hi> of which, God is beſeeched <hi>to ſend his bleſſing on this Ring, that ſhe who ſhall wear it may be Armed with the Power of Heavenly defence, and it may be beneficial to her, to Eternal life, through Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And in the <hi>latter,</hi> the Prieſt, Croſſing himſelf, <hi>Prayeth, that God would bleſs this Ring, which we in thy Holy Name bleſs, that whoſoever ſhall wear it, may abide in his Peace,</hi> &amp;c. Next, Holy Water is ſprinkled upon the Ring: And laſtly, the Bridegroom puts it upon the Brides <hi>Thumb,</hi> the Bridegroom ſaying, <hi>In the Name of the Father:</hi> Then upon her <hi>ſecond Finger,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>And of the Son:</hi> Then on the <hi>third,</hi> ſaying, <hi>And of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Then on the <hi>fourth,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Amen.</hi> And there he leaves it. And there is expreſſed a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Myſtery in leaving it upon that Finger. But there is uſed nothing of this impious or Superſtitious fooling about the Ring in <hi>our</hi> Office of Marriage. All the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about it are, the Bridegrooms putting it on the <hi>fourth</hi> Finger, he ſaying after the Miniſter, <hi>With this Ring I thee Wed;</hi> and the mentioning of it in the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er following, as a Token and Pledg of the Vow and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made between the Married Perſons. So that 'tis ſo far from being uſed as a <hi>Sacramental</hi> ſign among <hi>us,</hi> that it no otherwiſe differs from a meer <hi>civil</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, than as 'tis a Token and Pledg of a Covenant made between the Parties in <hi>the most Solemn manner,</hi> viz. <hi>as in the preſence of God.</hi> And in truth, <hi>this</hi> is ſuch a Symbolizing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I ſhould be aſhamed to beſtow two Words about, but that ſo many of our Brethren have been pleaſed to take offence at it.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to <hi>our Obſervation of certain Holy days:</hi> All I ſhall ſay about it is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is no Compariſon between the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Holy-days and the <hi>Popiſh</hi> ones.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Our few are purged from all the Superſtitious and wicked Solemnizations of the Popiſh ones.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We obſerve ſcarcely any beſides ſuch as wherein we have the Primitive Church for our Example: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe which are enjoyned upon the account of Deliverances and Calamities, in which our own Nation is peculiarly concerned.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. An obſervation of them, void of Superſtitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits about them, and onely as our Church directeth, can have no other than a very good Effect upon our Hearts and lives. If we could ſay as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did of the Chriſtians in <hi>his</hi> time, viz. <hi>By Feſtival Solemnities and ſet days, we dedicate and ſanctify to God, the memory of his Benefits, lest unthankful forgetfulneſs of them, ſhould in tract of time creep upon us,</hi> we ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be much the better Chriſtians for the obſervation of our Holy-days.

                           <hi>us, and 'tis likely that much odious talk is ſpread about it: And I make account that I am made the Author of this whole matter, and that by the Ignorant as well as Malicious; I can ſolemnly teſtifie of my ſelf, that this was done without my knowledge o deſire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Before I ever came into the City, there was no Holy-day at all obſerved beſides the Lords day; thoſe which are Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by you were taken away by that ſame Law of the People, which baniſht me and</hi> Farel: <hi>And 'twas rather Tumultuouſly extorted by the violence of Wicked Men, than decreed legally. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my return I obtained this temper</hi> (or mean) <hi>that Chriſtmaſs-day ſhould be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after your manner, but upon the other days extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſupplications ſhould be made, the Shops being kept ſhut in the Morning, but after Dinner, every one ſhould go about his own Buſineſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And, no doubt, the Governours of <hi>our</hi> Church would be abundantly ſatisfied with <hi>ſuch</hi> an obſervation of <hi>moſt</hi> of our Holy-days, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ordered at <hi>Geneva,</hi> would the People be generally ſo far confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have, I hope, ſufficiently ſhewed, that our Church's Symbolizing in <hi>this</hi> Rite too with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no otherwiſe than ſhe doth, can be no colour for Separation.</p>
                        <p>It may be objected, that notwithſtanding our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeveral times cited Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> for the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on the account of her Symbolizing as ſhe doth with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he calleth her Ceremonies <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiles ineptiae, tolerable fooleries,</hi> which would make one think that he was not in earneſt in calling them <hi>tolerable; fooling</hi> in the Worſhip of God being no doubt <hi>intolerable.</hi>

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I who know the Author of the Book, which hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you this trouble, better than any man, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>you</hi> are not more a ſtranger to <hi>him,</hi> than <hi>he</hi> is to <hi>you,</hi> from the Epithets you ſo frequently beſtow upon him throughout your Papers; except you do it (which I would not be ſo uncharitable as to think) by way of Irony.</p>
                        <p>In your <hi>Firſt</hi> Paragraph you expreſs a Liking of the Complexion of his Book; and I perceive you mean, that it pleaſeth you to find it not written in a heat, and that there is nothing of a Cenſorious or Peeviſh humour, or of a haughty contempt of thoſe he deals with, therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. And he hopes that upon the ſame accounts, you are no leſs pleaſed with the <hi>other Reſolutions of Caſes,</hi> which bear <hi>this</hi> company. But he thinks it no <hi>mighty</hi> Attainment, to be able in <hi>writing</hi> to manage a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie Coolly and Sedately; without bitter or provoking
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:485"/> Reflexions, or contemptuous Expreſſions. Though men of warm Tempers may find it ſomewhat difficult, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Spirits and Paſſions, as it becomes them, in the heat of diſputing by <hi>word of mouth;</hi> one would think that a ſmall meaſure of <hi>Humility</hi> or <hi>Good nature,</hi> or of <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> ſhould make it no hard matter to acquire that <hi>other</hi> Attainment: And, much more, that no one who is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in Spirit and Temper, as well as in <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> can find it a difficult thing to arrive at it. But enough of <hi>this.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In your <hi>Second</hi> Paragraph, you ſeem to intimate, that our Author might have ſpared his pains in dwelling ſo long upon the Diſtance between <hi>our</hi> Church and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in points of <hi>Doctrine:</hi> But he is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the <hi>reaſons</hi> you give for the needleſneſs of ſo doing. Your reaſons are two; Firſt, becauſe <hi>he argued chiefly for Communion in</hi> Worſhip. And Secondly, <hi>you never met with the Doctrinal part of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles charged as Popiſh, nor our Church reflected on, as ſymbolizing with that Idolatrous Church, in Points of Doctrine.</hi> But theſe reaſons have not convinced our Author, that he is over long upon <hi>this</hi> Argument; for it was not his deſign to ſhew, that <hi>our</hi> Church doth not ſymbolize in Points of Doctrine with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that She ſtands at great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>defyance</hi> with that Church: Not, that She doth not <hi>teach</hi> her Corrupt Doctrine in her Articles; but that ſhe deſignedly <hi>confutes</hi> them, and expoſeth the falſity and corruption of them. And <hi>this</hi> ſurely was worth the ſhewing in ſo many inſtances, for <hi>their</hi> ſakes who never read or conſidered thoſe Articles; as I fear very few of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have done.</p>
                        <p>And, whereas you ſay, you <hi>never met with the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles charged as Popiſh</hi> (and it would be ſtrange if you had) I ſay, there is too great cauſe to ſuſpect, that very few of our Diſſenting Brethren do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:485"/> how <hi>Anti-popiſh</hi> they are, though they do not charge them as <hi>Popiſh.</hi> And I doubt you have met with many (I am ſure <hi>very</hi> many are to be met with) who have reflected upon our Church as an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Church, though you never heard her accuſed as ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing with the Idolatrous Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in Points of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> But they will find it ſomewhat hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how a Church can be Idolatrous in matters of <hi>Practice,</hi> and yet be pure in her <hi>Doctrine</hi> from any tang of Idolatry. Surely her <hi>Practices</hi> muſt be grounded upon her <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or they would be <hi>ſtrange</hi> Practices indeed. And it would be wonderfull, if ſhe ſhould <hi>Practiſe</hi> Idola try, and yet <hi>Believe</hi> nothing that tends to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that foul Sin; nay believe and teach all thoſe Doctrines that are as Oppoſite to Idolatry, as Light to Darkneſs. So that I conceive nothing could be more to our Author's purpoſe, than to endeavour to remove that prejudice of many, againſt the Conſtitution of our Church, which is grounded upon an Opinion of its being near of kin to Popery. And what could ſignifie more to their Conviction, that there is not any ground for ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than the ſhewing how abhorrent to Popery our Church is in her <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and what a teſtimony ſhe beareth in her Articles againſt the Idolatrous and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and the <hi>Practices</hi> which ſhe foundeth upon thoſe Doctrines?</p>
                        <p>As to the ſeveral Additions you ſay may be made to the <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>Now I hope by this time, you underſtand very well <hi>what our Author would have you conclude,</hi> from this firſt part of his Performance, which you ſay <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>pag.</hi> 4.</note> 
                           <hi>you do not well underſtand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas you ask, <hi>whether it be that the</hi> 39 <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have in them nothing of kin to Popery, as to matters of Faith?</hi> And add <hi>that you dare ſay, there is not a judicious Diſſenter in</hi> England <hi>will ſay they have.</hi> I anſwer, if there be any <hi>injudicious</hi> Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> that will ſay they have, I hope theſe poor people ought not to be ſo deſpiſed, as that we ſhould uſe no means for the undeceiving of them. But our Author would have you conclude, that he hath <hi>done</hi> what he <hi>deſigned,</hi> which is (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) not to ſhew that the 39 Articles have <hi>nothing of kin</hi> to Popery, but that they are <hi>moſt abhorrent</hi> from it; and that our Church is at the <hi>wideſt and vaſteſt</hi> diſtance from Popery in her <hi>Doctrinals;</hi> and conſequently one would think too, in matters of <hi>Practice.</hi> But our Author does not ſatisfie himſelf to prove this by <hi>this</hi> conſequence; but goes on to ſhew it in the particular inſtances of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Practice,</hi> after he had done it in Points of <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To <hi>return</hi> now to your <hi>Second</hi> Page, <hi>You ſay that it is mightily Satisfactory to you to hear our Author aſſuring you, that our Church alloweth her Members the judgment of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> &amp;c. But, Sir, you needed no Authors to aſſure you of <hi>this,</hi> ſince our Church hath done it as fully, as it can be done by words; and our Author no otherwiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures you of it, than by citing our Churches Articles. But whereas you add, that <hi>this you cannot but think impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Liberty, not onely to</hi> Believe <hi>and</hi> Judge, <hi>but to</hi> Doe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:486"/> 
                           <hi>alſo according to what a man believes and judgeth;</hi> ſurely you will find your ſelf able to think <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> when you have conſidered, what is the neceſſary and immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch a thought, <hi>viz.</hi> that all ſuch things as <hi>Laws</hi> are utterly inconſiſtent with allowing to men the <hi>Judgment of Diſcretion,</hi> according to this large notion: And that, therefore our Church doth <hi>faultily</hi> Symbolize with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in having any ſuch things as <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You next ſay, <hi>that our Author ſpeaketh very true as to the Popiſh Rites and Ceremonies, and that thoſe in our Church are comparatively few; but you much doubt, whether the uſe of thoſe few was long before Popery appeared in the world, unleſs he means Popery at its full growth; for that Myſtery of Iniquity, as to Rituals, began to work very early.</hi> To this I anſwer, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may con you great thanks for this paſſage, it plainly enough intimating that the Primitive Fathers and Chriſtians were for the moſt part <hi>Papiſts,</hi> though not <hi>fully grown</hi> Papiſts. And as to thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul, The Myſtery of iniquity doth already work,</hi> if you can do any thing <hi>like</hi> proving that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle meant by the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity, which began to work in his days,</hi> the uſe of ſuch Rites as thoſe you are offended with in <hi>our</hi> Church, I will engage for our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that he ſhall immediately ſet up for a <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſay in your <hi>Third</hi> Page, that <hi>you cannot well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how our Author ſaith, that our Church doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her Rites as neceſſary, unleſs he means as neceſſary in order to Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. But doth he not expreſly tell you what he means by <hi>neceſſary?</hi> you found he did, if you read the whole Sentence, which runs thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>And ſhe impoſeth her Rites not</hi> (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does <hi>her's) as neceſſary, and as parts of Religion, but as merely indifferent and changeable things,</hi> as we find in her <hi>34th</hi>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:487"/> Article, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why, Sir, did you conceal <hi>this</hi> part of the Sentence, and thus ſtop at a <hi>Comma?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You thus proceed; <hi>Nor do I well underſtand how they are not made neceſſary to Salvation, when the non-obſervance of them is made ſinfull, and meritorious of a being caſt out of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. And I aſſure you, that I do as little underſtand, if this be good arguing, how whatſoever the King commands of his Subjects, or a Maſter of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, is not made by them <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> ſince the non-obſervance of the Lawfull Commands of each, is acknowledged to be <hi>ſinfull,</hi> by all that believe <hi>theſe</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts binding, <hi>viz. Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Servants obey in all things your Maſters,</hi> &amp;c. And as to the Penalty you mention, of <hi>being caſt out of the Church, and cut off from the Body of Chriſt,</hi> which is the ſame thing, it amounts to <hi>thus</hi> much; That thoſe who will by no means be prevailed with, to conform to the Laws of the Society of which they are Members, ſhall be caſt out of it: which all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and Bodies Politique whatſoever, have ever thought fit to have inflicted, upon obſtinate Tranſgreſſors of their Laws, in order to the preſervation of themſelves, and the upholding of Government amongſt them. And our Author I am certain will readily grant, that none but <hi>Obſtinate</hi> Tranſgreſſors of the Churches Laws, and ſuch as are incorrigible by all other means firſt tryed, ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:487"/> as <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> when the non-obſervance of any of them is no otherwiſe judged to be ſinfull, than as it is an Act of diſobedience to <hi>Humane</hi> Authority; and when this Penalty is never (according to the Rules of our Church) to be inflicted, but in caſe of the Offender's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>contempt</hi> to his <hi>diſobedience?</hi> If any inſtances can be given of perſons being Excommunicated upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Nonconformity, who are humble and modeſt and peaceable, and that give good evidence of their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to comply with the Laws of their Governours as far as they are able with ſafe conſciences, this I am ſure is wholly the fault of <hi>Perſons,</hi> not of our <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> But this Objection is too inconſiderable to deſerve our beſtowing ſo many words upon it.</p>
                        <p>All that follows to the bottom of your <hi>Fifth</hi> Page, wherein our Author is concerned, hath been replied to: And <hi>there</hi> you thus ſpeak. <hi>As in</hi> England <hi>we have a</hi> Silent <hi>and a</hi> Speaking <hi>Law, ſo we have alſo a</hi> Silent <hi>and a</hi> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We know the Doctrine of the</hi> Church of England <hi>in the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles; but this is but</hi> Eccleſia Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta: <hi>How many have we that will tell us, We are</hi> Eccleſia Loquens, the Living <hi>Church of</hi> England; <hi>and we tell you,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>Nor do I know any one of our Divines that hath ever taught your <hi>6th</hi> Doctrine, <hi>That whole Chriſt is under each Element:</hi> which you intimate is <hi>the onely foundation on which the Sacrilegious</hi> Romiſh <hi>Practice ſtands.</hi> But if I could believe that Doctrine to be true, I ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding judge it an intolerable thing to refuſe the Cup to the Laity, againſt the expreſs Inſtitution of our Lord.</p>

                        <p>Nor your <hi>13th, That there is no Eternal Predeſtination of perſons to life, and the means tending thereunto.</hi> I know of none of our Church that have ever taught this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as you have expreſſed it; nor any worſe than <hi>this, That Eternal Predeſtination</hi> to life is not <hi>Irreſpective</hi> or <hi>Abſolute;</hi> which no Article of our Church ſaith it is.

                        <p>And thus have I gone over all the Doctrines contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the 39 Articles, taught by your <hi>Eccleſia Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens, yours</hi> I ſay, for ſhe is not <hi>ours;</hi> and I declare again, that I know of no Divine of our Church, that teacheth or holdeth ſuch Doctrines.

You ſay, <hi>we ſpare any names in theſe caſes;</hi> but be you entreated <hi>not</hi> to ſpare them.

                        <p>Sir, to deal freely with you, I cannot but wonder, at your adventuring into the World this other <hi>Celeuſma;</hi> ſince the Author of the former had ſo ill ſucceſs, and muſt needs have repented him heartily of that Undertaking. All that have conſideratively read his Anſwerer, I am confident are convinced, that after a <hi>Great Cry, Little Wooll</hi> appeared; or rather <hi>none</hi> at all. Nor can ſuch be ignorant, what <hi>foul</hi> play was uſed to make our Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> broach Hereſie. And I doubt not but <hi>you</hi> your ſelf have bluſhed at it, if you have ever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:490"/> read the <hi>Parallela imparia;</hi> ſive <hi>Specimen fidei Celeuſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticae.</hi> Could you catch <hi>us</hi> thus dealing with the Books of <hi>your</hi> Authors, as <hi>ours</hi> have been dealt with by <hi>that</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and ſome <hi>others</hi> that might be named, we ſhould at <hi>another</hi> kind of rate have been expoſed, than <hi>they</hi> have been.</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, for God's ſake, let us make as much Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of vile Calumny, than which there is not a more expreſs Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, nor of the very Light of Nature, as of Obedience to Authority in ſuch things as no Divine Law can be produced againſt; and nothing but ſtrained and far-fetcht Conſequences. And, for God's ſake alſo, let us at length be perſwaded to have ſo great a concern for our common <hi>Religion,</hi> as to give over expoſing it by ſuch unchriſtian doings, to the Scorn and Deriſion of our Common <hi>Enemy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I cannot take my leave of this heavy <hi>Charge</hi> of yours, till I have asked you, what you <hi>inferr</hi> from thence, on ſuppoſition you can make good proof of it? It is plain your deſign in all this talk, is to juſtifie, if not a <hi>total,</hi> yet a <hi>partial</hi> Separation.

                           <hi>That you are very far from thinking that there are not multitudes of Holy and Learned men in our</hi> Eccleſia Loquens, <hi>that in theſe things are of another mind:</hi> And therefore, I hope, you will not excuſe Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from <hi>their</hi> Churches.</p>

                           <hi>That hundreds of the</hi> Speaking Church <hi>are, as we believe, as far from ſymbolizing with the Church of</hi> Rome (you mean in Doctrine) <hi>as the Articles; And that in this thing a Separation from the</hi> Silent, <hi>as well as this part of the</hi> Speaking <hi>Church, muſt needs be highly Sinfull.</hi> And in thus declaring, you condemn the <hi>generality</hi> of thoſe that Separate; it being well known that Communion with thoſe whom you will acknowledge to be <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divines, and thoſe which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:490"/> you account <hi>Heterodox,</hi> is much alike boggled at. But I fear, when all is done, you condemn onely ſeparation in <hi>Heart</hi> from theſe <hi>Orthodox</hi> men; your Undertaking in your <hi>8th</hi> Page makes me fear <hi>this;</hi> viz. <hi>That all the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable perſons in</hi> Presbyterian <hi>and</hi> Independent <hi>Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhall give any reaſonable aſſurance, that they are not in</hi> Heart <hi>divided from a Single Perſon, in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>that ſpeaketh in matters concerning</hi> Doctrine, <hi>as our Church doth in her</hi> Articles: But if you think that all the Communion you are obliged to hold with <hi>theſe</hi> Div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is ſuch Church Communion as will well conſiſt with rending and tearing the Church in pieces.</p>
                        <p>But I pray do not think that all this while I take it for <hi>granted,</hi> that 'tis lawfull to ſeparate from the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Divines whom we take to be in ſome points Heterodox. Nay upon ſuppoſition that <hi>your Eccleſia Loquens</hi> did as generally depart from the Doctrine of our Church, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s time did from the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> I ſhall be far from granting that Separation from their Congregations is lawfull, except there be a conſtraint laid upon us to ſubſcribe to their Heterodox Opinions, till you can prove that our Saviour allowed of the <hi>Jews</hi> Separation from the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> which you never can, but the <hi>contrary</hi> who cannot ſhew? He bad his Diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>to beware of the Leaven of the Phariſees;</hi> and ſo are <hi>we</hi> to beware of the <hi>Leaven</hi> of ſuch Heterodox Teachers; but not ſo to beware of it, as not to come within their Churches; for that <hi>that</hi> caution of our Saviour is not to be ſo interpreted, appears not onely from his own practice (who was far from being a Separatiſt from the Jewiſh <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Synagogues)</hi> and by what he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 2, 3.</p>

                        <p>In the laſt Paragraph of your <hi>9th</hi> Page, you return to ſpeak more <hi>directly</hi> to our Author: And <hi>firſt</hi> you reflect upon <hi>theſe</hi> words in his Book, <hi>p.</hi> 24. <hi>But I am ſo far from taking it for granted, that a Church is guilty of Sin in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in ſome indifferent things with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>that I muſt needs profeſs, I have often wondered, how this ſhould become a Queſtion: Seeing whatſoever is of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature, as it is not</hi> commanded, <hi>ſo neither is it</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden <hi>by any Moral or Poſitive Law; and where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> &amp;c. To <hi>this</hi> you ſay, that <hi>it is an obvious begging the Queſtion.</hi> And it might be ſo, if our Author <hi>ſtopt</hi> here, but he <hi>thus</hi> proceeds: <hi>And whereas certain circumſtances will make things, that in themſelves are neither Duties nor Sins, to be either Duties or Sins, and to fall by</hi> Conſequence, <hi>under ſome Divine Command or Prohibition; I have admired how</hi> this <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an indifferent thing's being uſed by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>can be thought to alter the nature of that thing, and make it ceaſe to be indifferent, and become ſinfull.</hi> So that <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Obvious</hi> meaning of our Author's words, that he hath wondered how it ſhould become a Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Church may lawfully agree in ſome things with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Law of God hath not forbidden: And whereas ſome things that are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Law of God <hi>directly,</hi> are notwithſtanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden thereby <hi>Conſequentially,</hi> he hath admired how the mere Circumſtance of a thing's being <hi>practiſed by the Church of</hi> Rome, can ſpeak it to be forbidden by God's Law <hi>Conſequentially.</hi> And then he immediately betakes himſelf to the conſideration of ſome of thoſe Laws given to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that prohibit their imitating the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> which are urged by Nonconformiſts, to prove it unlawfull to imitate the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in things of a mere indifferent nature, and that <hi>that</hi> circumſtance of their being practiſed by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:491"/> 
                           <hi>that</hi> Church makes them ceaſe to be indifferent, and to become Sinfull: And endeavours to ſhew, that <hi>this</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any ſhew of reaſon be gathered from <hi>theſe</hi> Laws.</p>
                        <p>And how, I pray, is <hi>this</hi> an <hi>Obvious begging of the Queſtion?</hi> which is, <hi>Whether a Church's ſymbolizing, or agreeing in ſome things, with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>be a warrant for ſeparatian from the Church ſo agreeing? This,</hi> I ſay, is the Queſtion which our Author handles.</p>
                        <p>But you next <hi>make</hi> a Queſtion for him, and ſay it is <hi>this,</hi>

For</p>
                        <p>Firſt, There are <hi>three</hi> apparent Contradictions in it. It being a contradiction to ſay concerning the <hi>ſame</hi> thing, that it is in <hi>its own nature indifferent,</hi> and yet <hi>naturally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Worſhip of God, as it is an humane Act.</hi> It being <hi>ſo</hi> too, to ſay of the <hi>ſame</hi> thing, that 'tis <hi>in its own nature indifferent,</hi> and yet <hi>

But you <hi>abuſe</hi> them, if you do ſo; for <hi>that</hi> which divers of them do aſſert, and which occaſioned our Author's <hi>Reſolution of the Caſe of Symbolizing,</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>this; That things which</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, as this Queſtion is put, you are ſure to have no Adverſaries. For <hi>who</hi> ever doubted whether a thing be unlawfull in the Worſhip of God, that is <hi>

                        <p>Now, having thus ſtrangely put the Queſtion, you proceed to ſhew that from thence will follow ſeveral things, <hi>as things out of controverſie betwixt us.</hi> And I perceive you are very cautious herein of reviving a certain <hi>Old</hi> controverſie among <hi>your ſelves,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether our Old Churches, Bells and Fonts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may ſtill be uſed.</hi> For you <hi>thus</hi> word your <hi>third</hi> particular wherein we are agreed, <hi>viz.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:493"/> the <hi>others</hi> Conſcience. If therefore you can <hi>prove</hi> that theſe Rites of our Church are <hi>Temptations</hi> to any of its Members to go over to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Idolatry</hi> ſtill continuing therein, you ſhall be ſo far from being <hi>oppoſed</hi> by our Author, that he'll heartily join with you in endeavouring by all lawfull means to have them <hi>aboliſhed;</hi> on ſuppoſition that the Temptation cannot otherwiſe be taken away. But I deſire you, by the way, to take notice, that it is not the Deſign of his Book (which you could not but <hi>ſee,</hi> though you would <hi>ſeem</hi> not to ſee it) to plead for the <hi>continuance</hi> of theſe Rites (as <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>harmleſs</hi> things at <hi>leaſt</hi> as he takes them to be) but onely to perſwade Diſſenters not to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> from our Church upon the account of <hi>ſuch</hi> things; and to ſhew that their having <hi>been abuſed</hi> is no juſt ground for <hi>Separation.</hi> And, having minded you of <hi>this,</hi> I ſhall not need to tell you, that the <hi>other</hi> Old-Teſtament Text, which you have added to thoſe which <hi>he</hi> hath replied to, is alledged very impertinently: which yet we'll beſtow two or three words in anſwer to.</p>
                        <p>But firſt let us ſee what you <hi>reply</hi> to what he ſaith to theſe Texts. You ſay, <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <hi>you cannot poſſibly get leave of your ſelf (conſidering under what terms of Divine Abhorrence God every where mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Idolatry in Holy writ,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>to be of the mind of our Author, that the Texts,</hi> Lev. 19. 2. Deut. 14. 1. Lev. 19. 19. <hi>are merely to be underſtood of things in themſelves evil.</hi> Nor, by the way, is our <hi>Author</hi> of that mind, for he acknowledgeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. that the things forbidden in the <hi>laſt</hi> of theſe places <hi>are things of ſo indifferent a nature, that none can be more indifferent.</hi> But, he asks, <hi>where it is ſaid, that theſe things were forbidden, becauſe the</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <hi>uſed them?</hi> And he addeth, that <hi>though</hi> Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>ſaith, that the</hi> Egyptians <hi>uſed theſe</hi> Mixtures of Seeds,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:493"/> 
                           <hi>and of</hi> Linnen and Woollen <hi>in many of their Magical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, yet 'tis univerſally acknowledged, that theſe things, among many others, were forbidden to the</hi> Jews, <hi>as Myſtical inſtructions in Moral duties.</hi> But to <hi>this</hi> you are perfectly <hi>ſilent.</hi> But <hi>why</hi> cannot you be of our Author's mind, as to the two <hi>other</hi> Texts? You ſay, <hi>The following part of the Chap.</hi> Lev. 18. <hi>gives ſome colour to interpret that place of things morally evil; yet, why are they forbidden under the notion of things done, after the doings of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>and the</hi> Canaanites? I anſwer, becauſe they were the <hi>doings</hi> of thoſe people, whom they were exceedingly prone to <hi>imitate,</hi> even their greateſt Immoralities: And this is a ſufficient Anſwer. <hi>Then</hi> you tell us, Nor is <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 1. or <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>capable of ſuch a ſenſe.</hi> But our Author ſaith not a word of <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 8. for 'tis verſe the <hi>19th</hi> that he ſpeaks to, and (as hath been ſaid already) he never ſaith that in <hi>this</hi> place the things forbidden are <hi>morally evil,</hi> but the contrary. But as to thoſe things forbidden in <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 1. he ſheweth that they <hi>are morally evil,</hi> nor is your bare ſaying, that that place is <hi>not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a ſenſe,</hi> a confutation of him.</p>
                        <p>And now we come to the Text, which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your Author to conſider, in theſe words. <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <hi>But becauſe our Author tells us, he can find no other Texts,</hi> that make more, if ſo much, for this purpoſe, <hi>I ſhall deſire you, Sir, but to conſider</hi> Hoſ. 2. 16, 17. <hi>And it ſhall be at that day ſaith the Lord, that thou ſhalt call me Iſhi, and ſhalt call me no more Baali. For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth; and they ſhall no more be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by their name.</hi> Now upon this Text you ſay, <hi>That</hi> Baali <hi>was a very good name; if we conſider it in its ſelf what doth it ſignifie more than</hi> my Lord? <hi>Adonai is of the ſame ſignification, by which name it was never unlawfull to call God:</hi> But <hi>becauſe the Idol was called</hi> Baal, <hi>God abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it; though he allowed himſelf to be called by another</hi>
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:494"/> 
                           <hi>name of the ſame ſignificancy. Nor will I believe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf owns that it was lawfull for the</hi> Jews, <hi>to apply themſelves to God under the name of</hi> Baali. Now becauſe you lay ſo much weight upon this Text, you ſhall have the <hi>fuller</hi> Anſwer. And,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I ſay that God doth not in the former verſe give the <hi>Jews</hi> a <hi>Prohibition</hi> no more to call him <hi>Baali,</hi> but makes them a gratious <hi>Promiſe</hi> that they ſhall not. 'Tis plain by what goes <hi>before,</hi> that the words are a <hi>Promiſe, viz.</hi> by the <hi>two</hi> foregoing verſes: wherein God promiſeth them to ceaſe from plaguing them for their Idolatry, (that is, upon their true Repentance) and to give them again happy days. And <hi>then</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt call me</hi> Iſhi, <hi>and ſhalt call me no more</hi> Baali.

                           </gap> is, <hi>this</hi> ſignifying <hi>Sponſus Benignus,</hi> but <hi>that, Durus &amp; imperioſus Maritus,</hi> or <hi>Dominus,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Baal</hi> was to his Worſhippers; as the <hi>Criticks</hi> will tell you. Which is as much as to ſay, there ſhall no more be an occaſion given you from my ſevere uſage of you, to call me by a name that ſignifies, a <hi>harſh Lord,</hi> or he would not be to them like ſuch a Lord as <hi>Baal</hi> was, but he would ſhew them the kindneſs of a tenderly loving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for the time to come.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is manifeſt that God's meaning was not, that they ſhould never <hi>uſe that word</hi> Baal, <hi>becauſe Idolaters uſed it,</hi> and an <hi>Idol</hi> was called by that name; for then they might not uſe the name <hi>Jah</hi> neither, becauſe the <hi>Heathens</hi> uſed the name <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whereas it follows in the next verſe, <hi>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth;</hi> and <hi>they ſhall no more be remembred by their name.</hi> The following Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:494"/> do give ſuch a ſenſe of them as will not in the leaſt favour your purpoſe.

And whereas you ſay, <hi>becauſe the Idol was called</hi> Baal, <hi>God abhorred that name,</hi> I muſt needs tell you, that to think God can abhor a good name merely becauſe of its having been given to an Idol, ſpeaks a childiſh notion and opinion of that Infinitely perfect Being.</p>
                        <p>But after all this, let us ſuppoſe that God here forbad the <hi>Jews</hi> to call himſelf for the future by the name of <hi>Baal;</hi> this will not in the leaſt affect our Author; for if it were ſo, it could be onely upon the account of their vehement inclination to the worſhip of the <hi>Idol Baal;</hi> and therefore they might not take his name into their mouths, that ſo they might not be tempted, by uſing it, to worſhip him again: But our Author hath ſaid enough to convince you, that there is not the leaſt <hi>appearance</hi> of an Argument to be fetched from hence, againſt the lawfulneſs of our <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;</hi> or to prove, that ſince they were uſed without any <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Superſtition</hi> by the Ancient Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were abuſed by the Apoſtate Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they may not return to their firſt uſe, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> being perfectly removed: and moreover, no danger ariſing from the uſing of them, to the Members of our Church, of returning to Popery.</p>

But need I ſhew you the impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this paſſage? which is <hi>this, that the people now are more devoutly inclined, I very much doubt; I am ſure they had much more reaſon</hi> then <hi>than</hi> now, <hi>to be averſe to it; having more miraculous Operations and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary appearances of God to them, than</hi> we <hi>can pretend to. And I am ſure the hearts of all are by</hi> nature <hi>now, as bad as then.</hi> But,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Doth it argue that <hi>our</hi> people are more <hi>devoutly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, than the <hi>Jews</hi> were, becauſe they are not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Men that have nothing of Devotion in their tempers, may have no inclination at all to ſome certain Vices. But I need onely to ask you, whether the <hi>Turks</hi> be a <hi>devouter</hi> ſort of people than the <hi>Jews</hi> then were, or whether the <hi>Jews</hi> be more devout <hi>now,</hi> than they were <hi>then?</hi> becauſe (as every body knows) they <hi>both</hi> have at preſent not onely no <hi>inclination,</hi> but the greateſt <hi>abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to Idolatry, and ſo have had for many ages.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. What though our hearts be <hi>as bad by nature,</hi> as the hearts of the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> were, muſt <hi>we</hi> needs be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as much inclined to <hi>Idolatry</hi> as <hi>they</hi> were? Why then, I ask again, are not the hearts of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Modern Jews</hi> as much inclined thereunto? And yet I fear the hearts of each of theſe are no better by nature, than <hi>theirs</hi> were. But I am almoſt aſhamed to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to ſuch talk as <hi>this.</hi> And how, Sir, is it, that you can perſwade your ſelf <hi>thus</hi> to object, againſt ſo plain a

                        <p>But in what <hi>follows,</hi> you <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that we <hi>have a greater antipathy to Popery</hi> now, than we had formerly, though you do not <hi>grant</hi> it; and then add, that <hi>if ſo,</hi> you fear the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion,</hi> and the <hi>Fire of</hi> London <hi>and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have more contributed to it, than peoples natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to true Worſhip; or averſion from Idolatry.</hi> Well, let the cauſe thereof be what it will, if we <hi>have</hi> a greater Antipathy, that's as much as our <hi>Author</hi> aſſerted: He did not aſſign the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>But, I pray, did you obſerve any <hi>greater</hi> inclination to Popery <hi>before</hi> the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> than you <hi>now</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? Or <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion</hi> either, if you are ſo old as to be able ſo <hi>early</hi> to make Obſervations? I may ask too, what hath made the ſo often mentioned <hi>Turks</hi> or Modern <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſo exceedingly averſe to Idolatry, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, and Fire of <hi>London</hi> muſt needs make <hi>us</hi> ſo, and nothing elſe?</p>
                        <p>By <hi>this</hi> time, I hope you need not to be told the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which you ſay <hi>you underſtand not, why there is not a neceſſity, for the keeping as wide a diſtance between</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <hi>and</hi> Papiſts, <hi>as God appointed ſhould be kept between the</hi> Jews, <hi>and the</hi> Egyptians.

Or if they did not, will you ſay that they were guilty of <hi>Sin?</hi> For <hi>my</hi> part, I dare not ſay ſo; nor that it would be a ſin <hi>now,</hi> not to ſeparate from our Church, though our Governours were ſo remiſs as not to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>Idolaters,</hi> if ſuch were found therein; any more than it is ſo, upon the account of <hi>Promiſcuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,</hi> and <hi>Mixt Communions:</hi> As the Worthy perſon that publiſhed the Reſolution of <hi>that</hi> caſe, hath clearly proved, and proved too that it is <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfull</hi> to ſeparate upon that pretence.

                        <p>But I will not ſtand to diſpute <hi>this</hi> point with you, it being nothing to the buſineſs of our Author's Book; and all he aſſerts as to <hi>this</hi> matter, doth amount to no more than <hi>this,</hi> That we are not obliged to renounce Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in <hi>pure</hi> Ordinances, with ſuch as we know to be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> when it lies not in our power to keep them away.</p>
                        <p>And now you have brought me to our Author's <hi>Third</hi> Head of Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Agreement which is between the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>is in no wiſe ſuch, as will make Communion with the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>unlawfull.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſay, Page <hi>17th,</hi> That <hi>if our Author had ſaid</hi> all <hi>Communion, (viz.</hi> with the Church of <hi>England) is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, you had fully concurred with him; believing that this Church cannot be juſtly charged with Idolatry, and that ſome Communion may, and ought to be held with any Church that is not ſo charged.</hi> If you mean by <hi>ſome Communion,</hi> a not <hi>being divided in heart,</hi> as you before expreſs it, I ſay again, we thank you for nothing; the Communion which our Author pleads for, being (as your ſelf obſerves in your firſt Page.) <hi>chiefly Communion in</hi> Worſhip. But you proceed, ſaying, <hi>but as he hath laid it, I cannot agree with it. I am ſure Chriſt had Communion with the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church, and I believe he had ſo, in all acts of worſhip of his Father's Inſtitution, and I am as ſure he had no Communion with them in the Traditional part of their worſhip, as I am, that he would not himſelf practiſe, what he condemned ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely.</hi> But are you not as ſure that our Bleſſed Lord had Communion with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>inſtituted by his Father,</hi> as you are that he had <hi>no</hi> Communion with them in the <hi>Traditional</hi> part of their Worſhip? I am <hi>ſure,</hi> that in the <hi>former</hi> part of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are too too cautious, and in the latter not ſo cautious as you ought to have been: For you may be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:499"/> ſure of the <hi>contrary</hi> to what you affirm ſo poſitively, when you have conſidered, that our Lord could not have ſo freely been <hi>admitted into the Temple,</hi> had he not obſerved divers Traditions or Canons of the <hi>Elders,</hi> without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with which none might come thither. I ſhall not ſtand to inſtance in particulars, but refer you to Dr. <hi>Leightfoot's Temple Service,</hi> pag. 115. to 120. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, you may yet be <hi>more</hi> ſure of the contrary, when you have conſidered, how our Lord complied with <hi>Jewiſh Traditions,</hi> in the <hi>celebration of the Paſſover;</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> too as altered certain circumſtances preſcribed in its <hi>Firſt Inſtitution.</hi> Particularly, his ordering the Preparation of the Lamb on the <hi>14th</hi> day, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ordained the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it up upon the <hi>10th</hi> day. His eating the Paſſover <hi>lying along,</hi> being the poſture in which they ate their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Meals, according to a Jewiſh Tradition, as you may ſee in Dr. <hi>Leightfoot</hi>'s foreſaid Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 143, 144. whereas, according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Inſtitution, <hi>it was to be eaten with their Loins girded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in haſte,</hi> or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His complying with the Jewiſh cuſtoms of <hi>drinking Wine</hi> at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and concluding with the <hi>Hallel,</hi> or a Hymn. And not <hi>theſe</hi> onely but <hi>more</hi> Traditions than theſe, Dr. <hi>Leightfoot</hi> will ſatisfie you, were confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to by our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
                        <p>But you ſay Chriſt <hi>condemned ſeverely</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Traditions:</hi> But I ſay, he did not <hi>at all</hi> condemn <hi>all</hi> Jewiſh Traditions, and none but ſuch as by which <hi>they made the Commandments of God of none effect:</hi> And ſuch as they placed <hi>ſpecial Holineſs</hi> in, and neceſſary to acceptance with God; as is too evident to need my ſtanding to prove it. And, Sir, when you can prove that <hi>our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> are like to thoſe condemned Traditions, I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that our Author ſhall be as zealous againſt complying with them, as he is now againſt ſeparation from our Church upon the account of them.</p>

                        <p>But to go on, whereas our Author ſaith, of <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> and the three other following things, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. <hi>That he takes it for granted that there is nothing of Viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Immorality in any of them, to make them <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfull;</hi> and therefore that they are indifferent in <hi>their own nature.</hi> You reply, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. That <hi>there are few things to be named unlawfull in this ſenſe.</hi> I anſwer, there are as many things unlawfull in this ſenſe, as there are things prohibited by the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, and if you pleaſe to conſult our Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Decalogue, I preſume you'll find thoſe things not a <hi>few.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſay at the bottom of this <hi>18th</hi> Page, <hi>That it troubles you to reade your Author ſaying,</hi> I know not how our Brethren will defend the Apoſtolical Inſtitution of the Obſervation of the Lord's day, while they contend that <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> cannot be concluded from the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Tradition of the Catholique Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>why,</hi> I pray, Sir, doth this trouble you? You give this reaſon why, <hi>viz. Becauſe certainly, for the Apoſtolical practice in the Obſervation of the Lord's day, we have the infallible evidence of Holy Scripture,</hi> Acts 20. 1 Cor. 16. But you muſt prove that we have in thoſe Scriptures, or ſome <hi>other,</hi> infallible evidence for the Apoſtolical <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Obſervation of the Lord's day, and not for the mere Apoſtolical <hi>practice,</hi> or you will ſay nothing to the purpoſe. But to ſave my ſelf the labour of ſaying more upon this Argument, and of replying to thoſe few lines that follow againſt the Primitiveneſs of <hi>our</hi> Epiſcopacy, I entreat you to conſult Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's Apoſtolical Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Epiſcopacy demonſtrated,</hi> together with the moſt Learned Dean of St <hi>Pauls</hi> his Ample Proof of <hi>theſe two Propoſitions,</hi> in his <hi>

Firſt, <hi>that our Dioceſan Epiſcopacy is the ſame for ſubſtance which was in the Primitive Church.</hi> And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That it is not repugnant to any Inſtitution of Chriſt, nor</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>As to what you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 19. about <hi>Liturgies, viz.</hi> that <hi>they cannot be indifferent, if indeed</hi> (as our Author ſpeaks) <hi>they be highly</hi> expedient <hi>to be univerſally impoſed, yea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> I reply, you have not caught him in a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as you think; for his ſaying concerning <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 38. is, <hi>That he takes it for granted, that they are all indifferent in their own nature.</hi> And tells you what he means by <hi>thoſe words,</hi> in the <hi>next;</hi> viz. <hi>that there is nothing of viciouſneſs or immorality in any of them,</hi> &amp;c. Now is it a contradiction to ſay of the ſame thing, that it is <hi>indifferent in its own nature,</hi> and that 'tis <hi>neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering certain circumſtances?</hi> And I farther ſay, that Liturgies are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> conſidering, that through humane Weakneſs and Frailty, the performance of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with that Solemnity and Gravity, which it calls for, cannot be ſecured; and yet notwithſtanding they are ſtill things in <hi>their own nature</hi> indifferent; and ſo are all thoſe things too which God<hi>'s Poſitive</hi> Laws have made neceſſary; as all know who underſtand the difference between <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Poſitive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But as to the Antiquity of Liturgies, which you ſay our <hi>Author knoweth to be denied,</hi> you have had a good while extant that Diſcourſe which he ſaid was expected, and which you ſay <hi>you will patiently wait for,</hi> to give you ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, about this matter. And it is excellently fitted (as I hope you have before now found) not onely for the ſatisfying of Diſſenters about <hi>that</hi> point relating to Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, but <hi>divers others</hi> alſo.</p>
                        <p>In your next Paragraph, you tell us, <hi>that all Divines will readily acknowledge, that ſuch a Method and Order of a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as is not contrived in Subſerviency to the</hi> 3 <hi>General Rules, of Doing all to</hi> Edification, <hi>the</hi> Glory of God, <hi>and</hi> not giving offence to any of the Churches of God, <hi>may make it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> And I alſo do readily acknowledge <hi>this,</hi> and am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:501"/> that you cannot prove, that <hi>Ours</hi> is not ſo contrived as to be made not Subſervient unto thoſe Rules. And as to the <hi>laſt</hi> of them, whatſoever Churches pleaſe to <hi>take</hi> offence at our Liturgy, I am ſure it <hi>gives</hi> no offence to them.</p>
                        <p>In what follows you profeſs, <hi>that you never thought it unlawfull for any</hi> Laick, <hi>wholly to ſeparate from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>becauſe of our Liturgy</hi> (and I hope you think it no more <hi>Lawfull</hi> for a Clergy-man) <hi>nor did your ſelf ever ſo ſeparate.</hi> But for all that, you know that many <hi>hundreds</hi> and I fear ſome <hi>thouſands</hi> do. But you ſay, <hi>there is a new Generation ſtarted up, that not onely makes</hi> you <hi>a Separatiſt, but all</hi> Conformable <hi>Miniſters, if they do not every time read the Second Service at the Altar.</hi> This in good earneſt, is ſomewhat a hard Caſe; but I pray Sir, by what figure do you call one <hi>Start-up Warm Head</hi> a <hi>new Generation?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In your next Paragraph, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. You ſay, <hi>Our Author hath ſpied four little Thorns in ſome Diſſenters Fleſh, which he hath very charitably endeavoured to pick out.</hi> And you add, that <hi>you will candidly enquire if no bit of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main which may cauſe pain, and hinder healing.</hi> To make no reflexion, Sir, upon your expreſſing your ſelf thus phancifully, your meaning muſt be, that you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether our Author hath not well defended the <hi>four</hi> things in our Liturgy, which Diſſenters object againſt as ſymbolizings with the Roman Service, from being liable to juſt Offence: Of which,</p>
                        <p>The Firſt is, <hi>The ſhortneſs of many Prayers.</hi> But you ſay not one word in anſwer to what he ſpeaks in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication thereof: But tell us, that <hi>if ſome Diſſenters think that throughout the Scriptures there is nothing like</hi> this <hi>to be found, either in the Prayers of</hi> Solomon, <hi>&amp;c. or any others, and be a little ſtumbled at it, you cannot condemn them:</hi> But you muſt needs condemn it as an errour in them, to think there are no ſhort Prayers to be found in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, when there are many more <hi>ſhort,</hi> than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:501"/> there are <hi>long</hi> Prayers: When our Saviour uſed in the Garden <hi>thrice,</hi> a ſhorter Prayer than is any one in <hi>our</hi> Service: And when the Form he left behind him for <hi>our uſe</hi> is a <hi>very</hi> ſhort one. But if the uſing of a <hi>ſhort Prayer</hi> be not the thing blamed, but the uſing of <hi>ſeveral</hi> ſuch in the ſame Service, inſtead of one very long one, I muſt take leave to ſay, <hi>this</hi> is mere Wantonneſs. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay, <hi>you cannot condemn Diſſenters, if they be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtumbled at it;</hi> I ſay, to be ſtumbled at it ſo, as to make it one pretence for not joining with us in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is not to be a <hi>little</hi> ſtumbled at it. And you know that <hi>that</hi> which our Author is concerned to doe is, to perſwade Diſſenters not to be ſo much ſtumbled at any thing in our Prayers, as to <hi>leave our Communion</hi> upon the account thereof. Though he would be very glad to have them ſo well pleaſed with all of them, as not to be in the <hi>leaſt</hi> ſtumbled at any of them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Second</hi> inſtance is, <hi>The Peoples bearing a part with the Miniſter in Divine Service.</hi> And whereas our Author hath thought it enough to tranſcribe what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſaid in five particulars, to vindicate both the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Fitneſs hereof; you reply not one word to any of them. But you think you have <hi>balanced</hi> (as your word is) thoſe five with five of your own. 1. You ſay, <hi>Theſe Reſponſes do not ſuit the gravity and ſolemnity of</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip. But we ſay they do; and our <hi>yea</hi> is as good as your <hi>nay.</hi> 2. You ſay, <hi>many read falſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi> And whoſe fault is it, if they do? But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what is coming, that you cannot prove it. 3. You ſay, <hi>Many Children and Girls, underſtand not what they doe.</hi> And therefore why do you permit them to join in <hi>Singing?</hi> And why do you ſuffer them to hear Sermons? 4. <hi>Thoſe that cannot read,</hi> you ſay, <hi>are not edified in a confuſed noiſe, not being able to underſtand what is read.</hi> And then I hope you might have ſpared your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:502"/> ſecond particular; for thoſe that read <hi>falſely</hi> cannot then be obſerved ſo to doe in this confuſed noiſe. 5. You ſay, <hi>Many leud and profane perſons, are thus made to bear their ſhare in the Miniſterial part of Publique Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. But do you prove that this is bearing a ſhare in that part of Publique Worſhip which is <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> we will grant that not onely no <hi>profane</hi> men, but no <hi>Lay-men</hi> neither, be they never ſo <hi>good,</hi> may have their part therein. 6. You ſay, <hi>There is no ſuch practice in the Churches of God, in</hi> New England, Scotland, France, Holland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you think that our Author hath taken the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> that you urge ſuch an Argument as <hi>this</hi> to <hi>him?</hi> If you do, you are much miſtaken, Sir. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells you, in his fifth particular, <hi>That it was the decay of zeal in the people that firſt ſhut out the Reſponſes:</hi> And therefore thoſe Churches you mention ſhould doe well to imitate <hi>ours</hi> in this particular. I am conſtrained, Sir, to tell you again, that I am aſhamed of taking any notice of ſuch talk as <hi>this.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Third</hi> inſtance is, <hi>The taking of ſome of the Collects out of the</hi> Miſſal. You ſay <hi>you wiſh our Author had told us how many.</hi> But I ſay, 'tis not worth the knowing (if it were I could ſoon tell you) if thoſe that are taken thence are all <hi>good</hi> ones. And (conſidering what hath been ſaid) this is a ſufficient Anſwer. Remember our Author hath told you, that our Departure from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was deſigned to be a <hi>Reformation,</hi> not a total <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> and <hi>Extirpation.</hi> And I ſuppoſe the zeal of ſome Reformers that hurried them upon making no diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between things <hi>faulty,</hi> and thoſe that were <hi>innocent,</hi> occaſioned that honeſt ſaying of <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s, which I have heretofore <hi>ſomewhere</hi> met with, <hi>viz. Non intelligo iſtam Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatorum Mundi Theologiam.</hi>

                        <p>As to that which follows to the laſt Paragraph of <hi>pag.</hi> 23<hi>d.</hi> Enough abundantly hath already been ſaid to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you that you might have ſpared it. Onely let me once for all tell you, that whereas both <hi>here</hi> and <hi>elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,</hi> you inſiſt upon our being at perfect liberty as to the uſing or not uſing thoſe unneceſſary things, wherein we ſymbolize with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> you ought to know that while they are <hi>Enjoyned,</hi> we who are under Government are <hi>not</hi> at liberty; as the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles days were, as to the <hi>Eating of Meats,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas you touch here upon the topick of <hi>Scandal,</hi> I can not hope to ſatisfie you about this Point; if the two late judicious Reſolutions of <hi>that</hi> Caſe cannot do it: To which I refer you, and ought ſo to doe, it not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within our Author's Undertaking.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> inſtance is, <hi>The Appointing of Leſſons out of the Apocryphal Books.</hi> And what you ſay under this head, amounts to thus much, that <hi>you think it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> if they were not appointed. And therefore I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you are not for making this a Pretence for <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and Conſequently you can have no controverſie with our Author about it. Whether it were better or not, that we ſhould imitate the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> in reading them now and then on <hi>Holy-days</hi> and ordinary <hi>Week-days,</hi> merely for <hi>Example of life, and inſtruction of Manners, but not for the Eſtabliſhing of any Doctrine,</hi> let it be left to our Superiors to judge. But though you have a greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude than many other Diſſenters, as to this matter, yet you ſay that <hi>all ſhould not be forced out of their wits, nor made to doe what, they cannot, as well as you, apprehend lawfull.</hi> No, God forbid, that any one ſhould be forced out of his wits upon ſuch an account. But whom can you name that hath had the leaſt trouble given him, for not being at Church on a Week-day <hi>Holy-day?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I muſt take notice of one more paſſage, before I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:503"/> proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> Holy-days <hi>are the ſame with</hi> Sabbath-days, <hi>with thoſe who judge that there is nothing but</hi> Tradition <hi>for either.</hi> Here is a good <hi>Wipe</hi> for our Author. But I pray, Sir, did he ſay that <hi>there is nothing but Tradition for the Obſervation of the Sabbath?</hi> He ſaid <hi>that</hi> indeed, <hi>pag.</hi> 40th, from whence it may be inferred, that he believes that the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> inſtitution of the Obſervation of the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> is wholly to be gathered from the uninterrupted Tradition or Practice of the Catholick Church; and is <hi>that</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſmall matter</hi> to found it upon? When 'tis the foundation on which is built the Canon of the Holy Scriptures. But who are they that tell you, that from the Uninterrupted Tradition of the Catholick Church may be gathered the Apoſtolical inſtitution of the <hi>Other Holy-days?</hi> Name any one if you are able that ſo ſaith, or that ſaith that they are of <hi>Apoſtolical inſtitution.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now we are come to thoſe particular <hi>Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of our Church, in which our Author ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. <hi>Our ſymbolizing with Popery is ſo much condemned.</hi> And you ſay, <hi>pag. 24th.</hi> that he obſerveth in the general,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That our Ceremonies are not the hundredth part</hi> (you ſhould have added <hi>ſcarcely) of thoſe uſed by the Papiſts.</hi> And this you <hi>grant;</hi> but you add, <hi>that we may as well</hi> Symbolize in <hi>thirty</hi> as in <hi>three.</hi> But I muſt make bold to tell you, you never uttered a more inconſiderative ſaying. It ſeems then, 'tis no matter how <hi>many</hi> Ceremonies are uſed in Divine Worſhip, ſo they be all innocent. I am ſure St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was not of this mind. But it may be you'll ſay there are <hi>none</hi> innocent. But if ſo, you cannot ſay that we may as well uſe <hi>thirty</hi> as <hi>three:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>thirty</hi> muſt neceſſarily be a great hindrance to that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind that Divine Worſhip calls for; but he muſt have a Weak head <hi>indeed,</hi> whoſe mind muſt needs be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by <hi>three.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Our Author ſaith, that <hi>our Church impoſeth them</hi>
                           <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:503"/> 
                           <hi>not, as the other doth, on the Conſciences of her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as things of Neceſſity, as parts of Religion or meritorious Services.</hi> And you need not one word more of Anſwer to what you object againſt this than you have had already given you, <hi>viz. pag.</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>In your <hi>25th.</hi> page, you begin, as our Author does, with the Ceremony of the <hi>Surplice;</hi> and</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>he rightly obſerveth that all are not obliged to wear it.</hi> And this is ſagaciouſly indeed obſerved by him, if he does obſerve it; but he onely ſaith, that <hi>he cannot imagine why thoſe who are not obliged to wear it, ſhould be affrighted from our Churches, by the mere ſight of ſo innocent a thing,</hi> as he before had proved it to be, as it is uſed in <hi>our</hi> Church; but ſhewed it is far from being an innocent thing, as it is uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. You ſay, that <hi>you are not ſcandaliz'd at the ſight of it.</hi> But for all that, you know that not a few Diſſenters do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be ſo.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You ſay, that <hi>you are not ſure, that they uſe a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame form in the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>though they uſe ſome Garment of the ſame</hi> Colour; <hi>ſo that you doubt, whether in that we do ſymbolize with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>or no.</hi> I was in good hope when I had read <hi>thus far,</hi> that there would have been no Controverſie between you and our Author about this Ceremony. But I preſently found my ſelf miſtaken; for</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You make us notwithſtanding faultily to ſymbolize with the Church of <hi>Rome, in that we will not ſuffer this Garment to be worn but in Acts of Worſhip. So that,</hi> you ſay, <hi>it is neither merely for</hi> neceſſity, <hi>nor</hi> natural decency, <hi>nor</hi> Ornament, <hi>nor for</hi> diſtinction. But I ſay that this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is required, both for <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> You ſay it is not required for <hi>either,</hi> becauſe <hi>all Miniſters wear it not at other times.</hi> But I deny your Conſequence; for it is required as an Ornamental Garment <hi>in Divine Worſhip,</hi>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:504"/> and for diſtinction between a Miniſter <hi>officiating</hi> and <hi>not officiating.</hi> You may as well ſay that for the ſame reaſon, the <hi>Judges</hi> Scarlet is neither for <hi>Ornament</hi> nor <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> And ſeeing it is ſuch an Offence that this Garment ſhould be appropriated to Divine Worſhip, I deſire you, Sir, at your Leiſure to anſwer our Famous <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>viz.

                           <hi>Juſtice, their ſuitable Ornaments are a Beauty; are they onely in Religion a Stain?</hi> Time was when putting on a <hi>Gown</hi> merely for the <hi>Desk</hi> and <hi>Pulpit</hi> was accounted no Offence by Non-Conforming Miniſters, and conſequently they did not then eſpy any Unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in appropriating a Garment to Religious exerciſes. Nor do we place one jot more holineſs in a <hi>Surplice</hi> than in a <hi>Gown,</hi> or <hi>Cloak</hi> either. But you ſay, <hi>may not jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of ſome homage by it intended to God, and ſuch thoughts,</hi> as thoſe you ſuggeſted, <hi>ariſe in weaker Chriſtians?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, whether theſe thoughts <hi>may</hi> ariſe in them or no, you take as effectual a courſe as you can that they <hi>ſhould</hi> ariſe in them. And as for <hi>Homage intended to God</hi> by wearing the Surplice, I don't think any Chriſtians ſo weak as to phanſie ſuch a thing, if you and others would but <hi>let them alone,</hi> and not fill their heads with objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt innocent things, when you might employ your time with them to infinitely better purpoſe. I pray, Sir, be not offended if I once for all freely tell you, that by your poſſeſſing theſe weak Chriſtians with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable objections againſt the Lawfulneſs of obeying Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in things which are made by your ſelves doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them, and not with <hi>one</hi> Objection againſt the Unlawfulneſs of Diſobedience in doubtfull matters; is the way to make them <hi>everlaſtingly</hi> weak, and to make them <hi>worſe</hi> than weak too. It ſaddens the hearts of not a few good people to obſerve, that the fearfull conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of ſuch doings have not yet made you ſenſible <hi>whoſe</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:504"/> intereſt you have all along ſerved, by the means of them.</p>
                        <p>You next object three things againſt the Ceremony of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm, pag.</hi> 26.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>it is an adding to the Divine Inſtitution</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily. I anſwer we add <hi>nothing</hi> to Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I mean we add nothing more to Baptiſm, or any other Ordinance, as of Divine Inſtitution, than <hi>your ſelves</hi> do. And as to the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſarineſs</hi> of this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: if it were <hi>neceſſary</hi> it would be no <hi>Ceremony,</hi> at leaſt no <hi>humane</hi> one. If you mean there is no neceſſity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it. It is enough for a Ceremony that it is impoſed <hi>for good and profitable ends and uſes:</hi> And our Church tells you for <hi>what</hi> ends and uſes <hi>this</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> is required, in the <hi>30th</hi> Canon. If you mean there is no neceſſity of <hi>uſing</hi> it, now it is <hi>impoſed:</hi> I beg your pardon for being of a contrary opinion, till you prove it to be a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any law of God: And when you have done <hi>this,</hi> I will grant that it is neceſſary <hi>not</hi> to uſe it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>we attribute to the ſign of the Croſs, more than is truly due to it, as the</hi> Papiſts <hi>do.</hi> But <hi>we</hi> ſay, we <hi>do not,</hi> and ſhall perſiſt in ſaying ſo, till you prove we <hi>do.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. You ſay, that to expound <hi>Dedicated</hi> in the <hi>Canon</hi> by <hi>Declared</hi> (you ſhould have ſaid <hi>declared to be dedicated) is a Catachreſtical uſe of the word.</hi> What care I for that, if the word <hi>ought</hi> ſo to be expounded. You ſay, <hi>you will take no private Doctor's word for it, though greater than Dr.</hi> Burges. But you cannot otherwiſe underſtand that word, except you will make our Church to ſpeak contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in that <hi>Canon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is nothing you object, or I think can object, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ceremony of <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Communion,</hi> but you may find moſt ſatisfactorily anſwered in the Learned <hi>Reſolution of the Caſe of</hi> Kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet we will not wholly paſs by what you ſay againſt it. Having called the <hi>Declaration of our Church</hi> concerning it, an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:505"/> Declaration, <hi>pag. 26th,</hi> you ſay, <hi>pag. 27th, that it may be it ſatisfieth you, abſtracting your thoughts from the Bread, while you are upon your Knees:</hi> And he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, with the greateſt eaſe in the world, abſtract his thoughts from the Bread, muſt be almoſt ſtarved with faſting. <hi>But,</hi> it follows, <hi>if all cannot be ſo ſatisfied, ſhall they therefore be Ruined for their doubt in this thing?</hi> You ſhall have no <hi>new</hi> anſwer to this, beſides asking you <hi>this Queſtion,</hi> if there be any danger of Ruine in this caſe, who are <hi>moſt charitable</hi> to theſe Doubters, thoſe that doe their utmoſt to ſatisfie them, that they may not come near the danger, or thoſe that uſe their utmoſt endeavours to make all means unſucceſsfull, that are uſed for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction?</p>
                        <p>I muſt needs take notice alſo of your pleaſant anſwer to <hi>this</hi> paſſage in our Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 49. <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>there being nothing ſaid of the Geſture in our Saviour's Inſtitution of this Sacrament, he hath conſequently left the</hi> particular <hi>Geſture to the Determination of the Church; a Geſture being in the</hi> general <hi>neceſſary.</hi> Your anſwer is, <hi>Our Saviour bad his Diſciples</hi> Baptize, <hi>but ſaith nothing of</hi> Water, <hi>nor from what</hi> Fountain or River; <hi>hath he therefore left it to the</hi> Churches determination; <hi>that Miniſters ſhall Baptize onely with</hi> Roſe-water, <hi>or Water fetched from the</hi> River? Truly, Sir, a <hi>ſmile</hi> is the beſt Reply that is due to <hi>this.</hi> But do you in ſober ſadneſs then think, that nothing is left by Chriſt to the Churches Determination, neither <hi>place,</hi> nor <hi>time,</hi> nor any <hi>other</hi> Circumſtance? If this be not wild Fanaticiſm, there is no ſuch thing in nature; and I know you'll acknowledge it. But if the Church may determine the <hi>place</hi> of publick worſhip, and the <hi>times of day</hi> when to meet, becauſe our Lord hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ſuch particulars; why may not the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine particular <hi>Geſtures,</hi> when they are not by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined? And can you think, Sir, that it is well done
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:505"/> after this manner to <hi>Ridicule</hi> the Churche's Power? No, I know you cannot think ſo, and therefore this was an haſty Slip from your Pen, which you will not upon Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts juſtifie.</p>
                        <p>You ſay at the Bottom of this page, That <hi>you do not think what our Author mentions, pag.</hi> 50. <hi>of the</hi> Ring in Marriage <hi>worth the ſpeaking to: Becauſe Diſſenters gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believe the</hi> Ring <hi>a</hi> Civil <hi>Pledg,</hi> &amp;c. I wiſh they <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> thought ſo, and if they do not (as time was when you know they did not) I know not why you ſhould add, that <hi>How it comes into our debate you cannot tell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next you ſpend the beſt part of two pages upon our <hi>Holy-days,</hi> which is our Author's <hi>laſt</hi> inſtance of <hi>Rites</hi> which Diſſenters are offended with, upon the account of our Symbolizing in them with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>That it is God's Prerogative alone to make a day</hi> Holy, i. e. <hi>ſuch as it ſhall be ſinfull for any to labour in.</hi> But do you think that God<hi>'s Vicegerents</hi> have not power given them to ſet apart days to a holy <hi>uſe?</hi> And in any <hi>other</hi> ſenſe <hi>we</hi> do not think that any day is capable of being made <hi>Holy.</hi> 'Tis manifeſt from what <hi>follows,</hi> that you do not think ſo. And if you do not, can you think that our Governours have no power to forbid ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Labour upon thoſe days, which they have ſo ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? And if they have <hi>this power,</hi> can you think it <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> to <hi>diſobey</hi> thoſe laws of theirs, that prohibit working on thoſe days? And, if this <hi>be not</hi> lawfull, then I fear 'tis <hi>Sinfull.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>That God's Revelation of his Will for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Praiſes upon the Receipt of Signal Mercies; or ſolemn Prayers in times of great Diſtreſs, juſtifieth</hi> Magiſtrates, or Churches <hi>in ſetting apart in ſuch Caſes, Days for Praiſe and Prayers.</hi> Then, I hope, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> have power to make a day <hi>Holy;</hi> and Conſequently, they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:506"/> may forbid <hi>opening of Shops,</hi> and <hi>Ordinary labour,</hi> on ſuch a day: And therefore 'tis ſinfull to diſobey them herein.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>That all ſuch days ought to be intirely ſpent in Religious Exerciſes.</hi> But notwithſtanding you are ſo <hi>dogmatical,</hi> in this thing, I am Confident upon ſecond thoughts you'll acknowledge you were too raſh: For you cannot really <hi>think</hi> what you aſſert with ſuch Confidence, except you can find in your heart to reprove <hi>Ringing of Bells,</hi> and <hi>innocent Recreations</hi> after Sermon, on the <hi>Fifth of November,</hi> as Profanations of that <hi>Holy-day.</hi> And I hope we may make bold to call <hi>that</hi> day a <hi>Holy-day;</hi> it being ſo according to your own Conceſſion in the <hi>foregoing</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You ſay, <hi>That to ſpend an hour of ſuch a Day in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all the reſt in Idleneſs, Drinking, Revelling, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is not to keep a</hi> Holy <hi>but a</hi> Licentious <hi>Day.</hi> No body <hi>doubts</hi> this: But are you obliged by our Church <hi>ſo</hi> to ſpend Her Holy-days? And if you are not, but may keep them as ſtrictly as you pleaſe, what a ſtrange ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is this againſt the lawfulneſs of obſerving them!</p>
                        <p n="5">5. You ſay, <hi>That there is no need of keeping any ſuch days, in Commemoration of the</hi> Birth, Death, Reſurrection <hi>or</hi> Aſcenſion <hi>of Chriſt; becauſe God hath appointed</hi> fifty two, <hi>every year for that purpoſe.</hi> I anſwer, if you mean by <hi>no need,</hi> that there is no <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of the Churches ſetting apart days for the Commemoration of Chriſt<hi>'s Birth, Death,</hi> &amp;c. we will perhaps grant it; but what then? Doth it thence follow that the well obſerving ſuch days doth not tend to our Edification, to the more <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us up in our holy Faith,</hi> and encreaſe in Holineſs? you dare not <hi>ſay</hi> or <hi>think</hi> ſo. But I ſay farther, that the well obſerving them is of <hi>admirable</hi> uſe. And nothing would tend more to our Growth in all the Chriſtian Vertues, than beſides the general Meditation on <hi>the</hi> Birth, Death, Reſurrection <hi>and</hi> Aſcenſion <hi>of our Lord every Lord's day,</hi> to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:506"/> ſet days apart for the particular Meditation on Each of theſe Grand Myſteries of our Religion: There being in each of them more than enough to employ a whole day in admiring thoughts of it, and in praiſes to God for it, and in making Applications of it to our Spiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And therefore I am certain, you would ſpend your pains to far better purpoſe, if inſtead of prejudicing Peoples minds againſt the obſervance of ſuch days, you would Excite them (like the good Fathers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church) to the <hi>well</hi> obſerving, and making the beſt improvement of them. The generality, God knows, of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, are too too careleſly and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpoſed of <hi>themſelves,</hi> to need to be diſſwaded from the uſing of any helps to their being made more devout, and better People. And where there is <hi>one</hi> among us that is apt to be too <hi>ſuperſtitiouſly</hi> inclined, I fear there are ſome <hi>hundreds,</hi> who are more enclined to the other <hi>Extreme,</hi> that of <hi>profaneneſs.</hi> But our Author hath ſufficiently ſhewed, that the Popiſh Superſtitions are perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by our Church from the Obſervation of Holy-days. And no man that obſerves them as our Church directeth, can have the leaſt temptation from the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of them to be ſuperſtitious.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. You ſay, <hi>That to keep a day Holy to any Saint, is to make an</hi> Idol <hi>of that Saint.</hi> And do you think our Church in her <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> deſigns keeping Days holy to <hi>Saints?</hi> if you do <hi>not</hi> think ſo, why are you thus impertinent? But if you do, then you declare that ſhe makes <hi>Idols</hi> of <hi>Saints.</hi> And if ſo, why did you <hi>pag.</hi> 17th declare it, as your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the Church of <hi>England cannot be juſtly charged with Idolatry?</hi> But I think, that <hi>the making an Idol of a Saint,</hi> is idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. You ſay, <hi>That to keep a Day of Thanksgiving, for bleſſing the world with ſuch a Saint, is what God hath no where preſcribed; what neither the</hi> Jews, <hi>nor</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>in</hi>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:507"/> 
                           <hi>the firſt times ever did.</hi> So that it ſeems you are not ſo ignorant, as you now ſeemed to make your ſelf; but, do know why many of our Feſtivals receive their names from certain Saints. And <hi>why</hi> may we not, on certain Days, meet together, to praiſe God for <hi>bleſſing the world</hi> with ſuch Saints, as have been next to our Bleſſed Lord, the moſt Glorious inſtruments of good to the world; and at the ſame time hear thoſe Chapters read wherein their worthy deeds are recorded; and together with <hi>other</hi> Prayers put in <hi>one, for grace</hi> to follow thoſe bleſſed Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a holy Life (of both active and paſſive Obedience) which <hi>they</hi> have, through the Divine grace, left behind them? What <hi>Sin</hi> is there in all <hi>this?</hi> Nay, why ſhould not this highly <hi>become</hi> us, and be of ſingular advantage to us?</p>
                        <p>You give <hi>two</hi> reaſons why this is unlawfull. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>God hath no where preſcribed it.</hi> But muſt we be at this time of day, told that nothing is lawfull relating to the Worſhip of God, but what is expreſly commanded; when the Idleneſs and Folly of that Doctrine, hath been over and over expoſed as it hath been? But 2dly you ſay, That <hi>this is that which the</hi> Jews, <hi>nor</hi> Chriſtians <hi>in the firſt times never did.</hi> But, if you mean by the <hi>Firſt</hi> times, the times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> 'tis more than you can <hi>prove,</hi> that the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was never ſolemnly commemorated by the Chriſtians in <hi>their</hi> time. And I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you would not have had the Martyrdoms of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> commemorated, <hi>before</hi> they were Martyred, what if this be not <hi>recorded,</hi> is it therefore a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it never <hi>was?</hi> You find not I think the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi> of any one of the Apoſtles recorded in holy Scripture, except St. <hi>James</hi>'s. But if you mean by the <hi>firſt</hi> times, the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, I perceive you never read, or have forgotten, <hi>The Epiſtle of the Church of</hi> Smyrna, concerning <hi>Policarp</hi>'s Martyrdom. But I hope it needs not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:507"/> to be proved to you, that the Catholique Church obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Martyrum Natalitia,</hi> the Days whereon they were crowned with Martyrdom, even from the <hi>Second</hi> Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But where do you find it preſcribed in God's word, or recorded that it was practiſed in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times (for to be ſure you mean <hi>thoſe</hi> by the <hi>Firſt</hi> times) to <hi>praiſe</hi> God for the good Examples of Holy men, among other great Bleſſings, is it therefore unlawfull ſo to doe, as well as to doe it upon <hi>Set</hi> Days? You will not aſſert ſo abſurd a thing. In ſhort, Sir, think not that we need either Precepts or Examples, to juſtifie our doing of that, which the very Light of Nature, and Right Reaſon, do plainly declare to us, to be, though not a <hi>neceſſary duty,</hi> yet highly <hi>becoming</hi> us, and <hi>praiſe-worthy.</hi> And we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it is dictated thereby to be highly becoming us, to commemorate, at Annual Selected times, the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Goodneſs of God to us in giving us ſuch Shining Lights as the <hi>Holy Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. and to meditate upon Chriſt glorified in <hi>them,</hi> who with admirable <hi>courage</hi> firſt preached and propagated his Goſpel in the World, and with admirable <hi>Patience,</hi> for the ſake thereof, indured the greateſt of Miſeries and Calamities, and at laſt Sealed it with their <hi>Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. You ſay, <hi>But if Devout perſons will ſet apart Days,</hi> (you might have ſaid too, will <hi>obſerve</hi> Days ſet apart by the <hi>Church) to give God thanks for any ſignal mercies</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which I think, every Apoſtle is a moſt ſignal one) <hi>or to put up Prayers for any people in diſtreſs, provided they do not mock God, in giving him an holy</hi> hour, <hi>inſtead of an holy</hi> day, <hi>and ſpend the reſt of the day in</hi> Idleneſs, Gaming, Drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (And can you think that any of our Devout people, do not abhor ſuch practices as much as you?) <hi>Diſſenters will never blame, or condemn them for it.</hi> I hoped you would have ſaid, they will <hi>join</hi> with us, ſince Authority requires it.</p>

                        <p n="9">9. You ſay, <hi>Finally Diſſenters will never ſeparate from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>for the true keeping of a day holy to God,</hi> &amp;c. Yes ſurely they will, if it be a <hi>Saint</hi>'s day at leaſt, as one would think by what you have ſaid. But you add, that <hi>they will ſeparate from the Looſeneſs and commonly practiſed Profanation of it</hi> (and ſo do thouſands of thoſe that are <hi>no</hi> Diſſenters, I hope) <hi>or ſuch as were onely ſo, in the Pope's Kalendar, as St.</hi> George, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now you would, Sir, <hi>again</hi> feign your ſelf more ignorant than you are; for, no doubt, <hi>you</hi> know as well as <hi>we,</hi> that St. <hi>George</hi> his day is no <hi>Church of England</hi> Holy-day. And for all your <hi>[&amp;c.]</hi> you cannot but know too, that <hi>Our Church</hi> hath no Feſtival-days called by any Saints names, but ſuch as all Chriſtians own for the <hi>Greateſt</hi> of Saints, except thoſe <hi>Innocents</hi> who had the honour to ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake, before they were of age to know him. We have indeed a <hi>Faſt-day,</hi> occaſioned by the Horrid Murther of <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> whom we deſervedly honour as a Great Saint. But I never heard that this Saint ſtands in the <hi>Pope's Kalendar,</hi> and I'll warrant you never ſhall.

                        </p>
                        <p>And now, having done with our Author, you ſpend a good part of your <hi>five laſt</hi> Pages in ſuch diſcourſe, as is ſo far from tending to the compoſing of our Differences, and healing our wide and moſt dangerous Breaches, that it hath the moſt apparent tendency to the making them irreparable beyond all Remedy. And 'tis enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all ſober people, that the cauſe of thoſe that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is deſperate, to obſerve what ſtrange principles are taken up of late in the defence of Separation; even <hi>ſuch</hi> as the <hi>Old Non-conformiſts</hi> would have thought very <hi>wild</hi> ones, ſerving no better purpoſe than the Unhinging of all. And thoſe, Sir, which you here lay down ſo dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically

                        <p>For <hi>my</hi> part, I am too much tryred with Scribbling <hi>thus long,</hi> to take into conſideration this <hi>cloſe</hi> of your Book, farther than reflecting upon <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> paſſages; though I am not <hi>at all</hi> obliged to take notice of <hi>thoſe</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a Defender of our <hi>Author.</hi> And <hi>indeed</hi> (to deal like a plain-hearted Friend with you) it was but <hi>the other day</hi> before I could be perſwaded to think it needfull to Reply <hi>at all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. That Separation in theſe <hi>three</hi> Caſes is <hi>Lawfull,</hi> if not <hi>Neceſſary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your <hi>Firſt</hi> caſe is, <hi>When ſuch errours are in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Church, as, if they had been known before, ought to have hindered <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with it.</hi> But you do not tell us <hi>what</hi> Errours thoſe are. Would you have your Readers take it for granted, that there are <hi>ſuch</hi> Errours in the <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> But we may gueſs at <hi>one</hi> of thoſe Errours in our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> from that which you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. <hi>viz. That Governing Churches muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Officers, which cannot be, unleſs elected by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; who could never part with their Right in chuſing Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> &amp;c.

There</hi> you will find they have <hi>no</hi> Right at all, or I am much miſtaken. From what you ſay in theſe <hi>two</hi> Pages, and <hi>that</hi> which <hi>follows</hi> (in which your diſcourſe is ſuch, that 'tis hard to ſay <hi>certainly</hi> what you would be at) I ſhrewdly conjecture, that you believe it <hi>Lawfull</hi> to ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> although ſhe had neither <hi>Ceremonies</hi> nor <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> to ſcare men away.</p>
                        <p>Your <hi>Second</hi> caſe is, <hi>When a Church is turned Idolatrous;</hi> that <hi>then</hi> it is neceſſary to depart from it. And <hi>here</hi> we have no Controverſie.</p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:509"/>
                        <p>Your <hi>Third</hi> is, <hi>When a Church will not admit a man's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in it, unleſs he will doe ſomething which his Conſcience tells him is ſinfull.</hi> But, Sir, will you not acknowledge, that it cannot juſtifie our Separation that ſomething is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired which we judge ſinfull, whilſt we will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially uſe all means for the duly informing of our judgments: whilſt we call it a running into Temptation, to read what is offered us in Defence of the Lawfulneſs of <hi>that,</hi> we have a prejudice againſt: Whilſt we ſo confide in <hi>our own</hi> judgments, or in the judgments of our <hi>Party,</hi> as not to bear to hear that 'tis poſſible we ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? Surely all truly good men will acknowledge <hi>this.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>in all theſe Caſes Separating is</hi> Lawfull, <hi>if not</hi> Neceſſary: <hi>For in the two</hi> firſt <hi>Caſes we ought to Separate</hi> (And then I hope in thoſe caſes it is <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and not onely <hi>Lawfull</hi> to Separate) <hi>in the laſt we may prudently and warily depart,</hi> &amp;c. And why do you ſo <hi>mince</hi> the matter, by changing your phraſe, when your meaning is that you may <hi>Separate?</hi> And why do you ſo <hi>mince</hi> it too in ſaying, in the <hi>two firſt</hi> Caſes we ought to Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? which ſuppoſeth that in <hi>this</hi> Caſe you are at your <hi>Liberty,</hi> and that, though you may <hi>lawfully</hi> Separate yet it is not a <hi>neceſſary duty ſo</hi> to doe. And why again do you ſay, we judge this no <hi>ſinfull</hi> Separation? Why don't you ſpeak <hi>out</hi> and ſay 'tis a <hi>Neceſſary</hi> one? Except you think that a man may lawfully act <hi>againſt his Conſcience.</hi> But you have given me ſufficient aſſurance in your Book, that this you do not think.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. <hi>If any others in</hi> former <hi>Ages, or in our</hi> own, <hi>have had any other apprehenſions of the ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> (you would have ſaid <hi>ſignification) of the Terms,</hi> Church, Schiſm <hi>and</hi> Separation, <hi>whom we own to have been Holy and Excellent men, till we ſee their Notions juſtified from</hi> Holy Writ <hi>(which alone can determine theſe things)</hi>

                           <hi>we muſt crave leave to diſſent from them, and believe that had they lived in our times, they would have diſſented from their own Apprehenſions under a more perfect light,</hi> &amp;c. But</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What would you have ſaid to <hi>us,</hi> if we had given this Anſwer to <hi>your</hi> citing <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Excellent</hi> men, ſuch as <hi>Calvin</hi> (whom our Author hath ſo often appealed to in his Book) and <hi>others</hi> againſt <hi>our</hi> Notions? I am ſure you would have ſeverely upbraided us with having a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull opinion of our own judgments. Eſpecially if our Notions ran counter to all Antiquity, and the Judgments of all <hi>Holy Excellent men</hi> in former Ages, and to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of ſuch in our own Age and Time. But <hi>this</hi> I dare ſay may be aſſerted of <hi>your</hi> Notions concerning the Terms, <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Separation;</hi> and much of your talk concerning the Term <hi>Church</hi> too.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. How came <hi>you</hi> to have more light than the Holy and Excellent men in former Ages, and in our <hi>own</hi> Age too? which you plainly ſuppoſe your ſelves to have. Nay you ſuppoſe <hi>this,</hi> as to multitudes of ſuch perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as are your <hi>Contemporaries.</hi> For you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>We are far from thinking that there are not multitudes of Holy and Learned men, in our</hi> Eccleſia Loquens, &amp;c. that is, Among Conformable Divines of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                        <p>I will now conclude with a Remarque or two on thoſe words, with which you begin the concluding part of your Book.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. <hi>And now how happy ſhould we not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> think <hi>our ſelves, but indeed</hi> be, <hi>would our Brethren but leave diſputing; how far it is lawfull for the</hi> Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>to have Communion with the</hi> Great Whore; <hi>and onely argue how far we come ſhort of ſymbolizing with</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. It lieth not in your power to ſhew us a Church, which more ſymbolizeth with the <hi>Firſt and Pureſt Goſpel Churches,</hi> than the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And as for <hi>thoſe</hi> Churches which you believe do come nearer to the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Pureſt,</hi> it hath often enough been demonſtrated with invincible ſtrength, that the <hi>main</hi> thing <hi>(viz.</hi> the point of <hi>Government)</hi> in which you conceive they more agree with <hi>theſe</hi> Churches, doth ſpeak them far <hi>leſs</hi> to agree with them, than the Church of <hi>England</hi> does: And ſpeaks them to be therein <hi>unlike</hi> to the whole Catholique Church of Chriſt for <hi>fifteen hundred</hi> years together, from the time of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>

                        <p>We do not pretend that the Conſtitution of <hi>our Church</hi> is <hi>abſolutely perfect,</hi> we do believe that <hi>ſuch</hi> a Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the <hi>peculiar</hi> privilege of the Church <hi>Triumphant;</hi> but we bleſs God that 'tis no more <hi>imperfect,</hi> and we who live in complete Communion with <hi>this</hi> Church are well aſſured that there is nothing either in the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> thereof, or in what is required thereby, that <hi>hindereth</hi> us from being as good Chriſtians as ever were in the world. We cannot find after all the pains that you and others have taken to prove the contrary, that there is impoſed upon us any one condition of Communion that does contradict any Law of God; that tends in the leaſt to the depraving of our Souls, to the gratifying of any <hi>one</hi> corrupt Affection, or the making us unmeet for the Heavenly Happineſs.

                           <hi>Legiſlator</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Theſe two Conſiderations of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, <hi>purely as a Church,</hi> and as a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or as a Church under ſuch a mixture with a Common-wealth ought heedfully to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is ground for ſuch a diſtinction in the nature of the thing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe this diſtinction is made by the Apoſtle, who was of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> an <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and by conſequence very well qualified to underſtand the difference betwixt the <hi>Jewiſh Oeconomy</hi> as a Church, and as a Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, I ſay, there is a Ground for ſuch a diſtinction in the Nature of the thing, as is evident to any Man, who is capable of conſidering the difference betwixt the Church-Chriſtian before, and after its Union with the Empire. Before its Union with the Empire, it ſubſiſted by it ſelf purely as a Church above three hundred years, in a State of Perſecution, from Chriſt unto <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; and juſt ſo the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church for above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſubſiſted by it ſelf in a State of Peregrination and Captivity from <hi>Abraham</hi> unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> who brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and gave them the Law.</p>
                        <p>But Secondly, As there is ground for this diſtinction in the nature of the thing, ſo is it in effect made by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>This I ſay, that the Covenant that was before confirmed of God</hi> [with <hi>Abraham] in Chriſt, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe</hi> [to <hi>Abraham] of none Effect.</hi> Here is a plain difference made between the Covenant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, when he ſeparated him from the World unto himſelf, and that <hi>Political</hi> one, which he afterwards made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he gave them the Law: And this difference is alſo obſerved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>The Promiſe, that he ſhould be the Heir of the World, was not given to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or to his Seed through the Law, but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith: For</hi>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:514"/> 
                           <hi>if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe is of no effect</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From theſe words, which diſtinguiſh ſo plainly between the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Promiſe, which he made unto him, and the <hi>Law,</hi> it is evident that the beginning of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church purely conſidered, as a Church, is to be dated from the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, the way to find out the nature of the <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,</hi> or pure <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, is to conſider the nature of the Covenant, or Promiſe upon which it was founded; and if we examine the Scriptures, we ſhall find, that it was an <hi>Evangelical Covenant:</hi> For ſubſtance the ſame with that which is ſince made betwixt God and us through Chriſt. This will appear upon a Review of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which teach us, <hi>That Faith was the Condition of this</hi> Abrahamical <hi>Covenant; that it was made with</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>To this purpoſe ſpeaketh the Apoſtle in the Fourth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the 9th. to the 15th. Verſe: Cometh then this Bleſſedneſs [of <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith]</hi> upon the Circumciſion only, or upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion alſo? For we ſay, that Faith was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs; how was it then reckon'd? When he was in Circumciſion, or in Uncircumciſion? Not in Circumciſion, but in Uncircumciſion; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sign of Circumciſion a Seal of <hi>(the Promiſes made to)</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which he had being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:515"/> yet uncircumciſed that <hi>[ſo believing before Circumciſion]</hi> he might be the Father <hi>(both)</hi> of all them that believe, tho' they be not circumciſed, that righteouſneſs might be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them alſo <hi>(as his Children)</hi> and the Father of Circumciſion to them, who are not of the Circumciſion only, but <hi>(who)</hi> alſo walk in the Steps of that Faith of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he had, being yet uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; for the Promiſe that he ſhould be the Heir of the World <hi>(in his Poſterity)</hi> was not to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or his Seed, through <hi>(the Righteouſneſs of)</hi> the Law; but through the Righteouſneſs <hi>(which cometh)</hi> of Faith: For if they <hi>[only]</hi> which are of the Law be Heirs, <hi>(his)</hi> Faith <hi>(ſo much celebrated</hi> is made void, and the Promiſe made <hi>(to it)</hi> of no effect. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. from the <hi>5th</hi> to the <hi>10th</hi> Verſe: He therefore that miniſtreth unto you the <hi>(extraordinary Gifts of the)</hi> Spirit, and worketh Miracles among you; doth he it by the works of the Law, or by the Faith, which you have heard preached, even as <hi>(it is written of)</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Quoniam autem &amp; in <hi>Abraham</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurabatur fides noſtra, &amp; quoniam Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcha no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae fidei, &amp; velut prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta fuit, pleniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimè Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus docuit in eâ Epiſtolâ, quae eſt ad <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latas</hi> dicens, <hi>Qui ergo tribuit vobis Spiritum &amp; operatur virtutes in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis—</hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus Lib. 4. cap. 38.</note> 
                           <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, (he)</hi> believed God, and it was imputed unto him for Righteouſneſs; know ye therefore, that they which are <hi>(the Children)</hi> of Faith, the ſame are the Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and God in the Scripture foreſeeing that he would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith preached before the Goſpel unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi> So then they which be <hi>(the Children)</hi> of Faith, are bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham who is the Father of them that believe.</hi> Afterwards in Verſe 26. Now to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or his Seed, <hi>or Race</hi> were the Promiſes <hi>[of God]</hi> made: He, <hi>(i. e.</hi> God, or <hi>Moſes</hi> his Pen-man) ſaith, <hi>Not to Seeds, or Races,</hi> as if there were divers of them; but to thy Seed, <hi>i. e.</hi> to one of thy Seed, which is Chriſt. And this I ſay, that the <hi>(Abrahamical)</hi> Covenant that was before confirmed by God in Chriſt, the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe <hi>(made unto</hi> Abraham) of none effect.</p>
                        <p>From all theſe Texts put together, it is plain, that the <hi>Abrahamical</hi> Covenant, upon which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, as ſuch, was founded, was of a Spiritual, Evangelical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:515"/> and perfectly verified and fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt, who was made of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in whom all the Families of the Earth are bleſſed, and whoſe Day <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf ſaw, and rejoyced. It is farther evident from them, that this Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Father of Believers, and with his Poſterity, not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him by natural, but by ſpiritual Generation, as Heirs of his Faith, as is plain from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>(the Promiſe)</hi> is of Faith, that ſo alſo it might be by Grace; to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed (of <hi>Abraham)</hi> not to that only, which is of the Law; but to that alſo which is of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is the Father of us all, <hi>both Jew and Gentile, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> So Chap. 9. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not as tho' the Word or Promiſe of God to them had taken none effect: For they are not all <hi>(the) Iſrael</hi> which are deſcended of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are they all Children <hi>(of God's Covenant)</hi> but ('tis ſaid) in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy Seed be called; <hi>[tho'</hi> Abraham <hi>had more Sons]</hi> that is <hi>(all)</hi> they which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God; but the Children of the Promiſe (only as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was) are counted for the Seed.</p>

                        <p>As to the Perſons who were capable of initiation into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church by this Sacrament, we have a very plain account at the inſtitution of it in <hi>Gen.</hi> Chap. 27. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God unto <hi>Abraham) eſtabliſh my Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Me, and thee, and thy Seed after thee for an Everlaſting Covenant to be a God unto thee, and thy Seed after thee—Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations; this is</hi> [The Token of] <hi>my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which ye ſhall keep between Me and you, and thy Seed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, every Male among you ſhall be Circumciſed.

                        </p>
                        <p>From this account of Perſons to be Circumciſed, it is plain,</p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:516"/>
                        <p>Firſt, That <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were born of <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49.</note> Gentile Parents in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, or bought with his Money, as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants then were, and <hi>Blacks</hi> are now among us, were to be initiated into the Covenant by Circumciſion, from whence it appears, that the Spiritual Race of <hi>Abraham</hi> were the Children of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that when God promiſed to be a God to him, and his Seed after him, he meant the Children of his Faith. Hence in all Ages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, if any <hi>Gentiles</hi> embraced the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith and Religion, they were admitted into it by Circumciſion, and thereupon reckoned among the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the peculiar People of God, although they were not the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh. There were great numbers of <hi>Gentiles</hi> thus converted to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith and <hi>Religion,</hi> and grafted like wild Branches into the Olive-Tree, in all the Ages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. Not to mention particular Perſons, we read that many of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> became <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of <hi>Aſhuerus, Eſther</hi> 8. 17. <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Selden de jure</hi> l. 2. c. 2.</note> Likewiſe, in the time of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> vaſt numbers of the <hi>neighbouring Countries</hi> embraced <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> the whole Nation of the <hi>Idumaeans</hi> turned <hi>Jews,</hi> and lived in their own <hi>Country</hi> according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites. This ſhort <hi>account</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proſelytes may ſatisfie any <hi>Man,</hi> who is not perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond cure, that the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was not founded upon, nor conſtituted by natural Generation, but by Spiritual Regeneration, as the Church Chriſtian is, and that thoſe, who were then related unto God, as Members of his Church were ſo, becauſe they were the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who then was and ſtill is the Father of the Church, and Church Members, to whom he is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not in his Natural, but in his Religious Capacity, as he was a Believer, and the Father of all thoſe that believe.</p>
                        <p>But Secondly, It is manifeſt from this Scriptural account of perſons to be Circumciſed, that Circumciſion was an <hi>Ordinance of Latitude,</hi> comprehending Perſons of all Ages, and that Children, and Minors not yet arrived at years of Diſcretion, who were incapacitated, as to ſome ends of Circumciſion, were notwithſtanding to be ſolemnly initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:517"/> by it, as well as grown Men, who were capable of all. God was pleaſed to call them his; nay, they were his Property, as much as their Parents of whom they deſcended, he looked upon them as holy and ſeparate, and as Candidates of the Covenant, and he thought them ſo well qualified for admiſſion into it, that he would not have it put off beyond the eighth day.</p>
                        <p>He that is eight days old, or as it is in the Original, a Son of eight days, ſhall be circumcis'd among you. God was ſo far from excluding of them from Sacramental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiation upon the account of <hi>natural incapacity,</hi> that he limited the time for the adminiſtration of it, beyond which he would not have it deferr'd. And accordingly the <hi>Jews</hi> ever did moſt religiouſly obſerve it, from the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> unto the time of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and Chriſt, who were both Circumciſed the <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 59. 2. 21.</note> eighth day. Nay when any <hi>Gentile</hi> turned <hi>Jew,</hi> they immediately Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Children if he deſired it; always underſtanding that Children were called and elected by God in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Thus ſaith God unto <hi>Abraham, I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between thee and me, and thy Seed after thee for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and thy Seed after thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The great Goodneſs of God made him thus ſeparate the Children with their Parents from the reſt of the World, and look upon them as part of his choſen peculiar People, by which they became relatively Holy, and of a religious Conſideration, and differed from the Children of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as much as their Parents did from the Unbelievers themſelves. Since therefore God was pleaſed to be ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to chooſe the Children with their Parents, and look upon them as Holy upon their account, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he ſhould oblige them to dedicate, and devote them betimes unto him, by ſolemn initiation into his Church. I ſay, he called and elected them in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and with them ſeparated them unto himſelf from the World, and, agreeably to the nature of this Gracious Call, and ſeparation, he made it a ſufficient qualification for their actual admiſſion into the Church, by the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:517"/> Ordinance, which the Children of Heathens were not capable of, becauſe they were not ſo called, and choſen, and ſeparated of God.</p>
                        <p>This was ground enough for their admiſſion into the Church, and for God to look upon them, as Believers, though they could not make open Profeſſion of their Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did before he was Baptized, and it is certain, after the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> all <note n="*" place="margin">

But though <hi>Abraham</hi> profeſſed his Faith before he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, <hi>Iſaac</hi> the next Heir of the Promiſe was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed before he profeſſed, or could profeſs his Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he lived he was as ſure to profeſs it by vertue of his Calling, and Election as any adult Proſelyte was to continue in the Profeſſion of his.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Faith and Conſent of the Father, or, if the Child had none, of the Suſceptor or God-father, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 2. 46.</note> and of the <hi>Congregation</hi> under which he was Circumciſed, was believed of old by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be <note n="†" place="margin">

They had very good ground in the Scriptures for this Opinion, becauſe the Infidelity and Diſobedience of the Parents, in wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, or deſpiſing Circumciſion, was imputed to the Children, who were eſteemed and puniſhed as Breakers of the Covenant, when they were not circumciſed, as it is written, <hi>Every uncircumciſed Male, whoſe Fleſh of his Foreskin is not circumciſed, that Soul ſhall be cut off from his People; he hath broken my Covenant;</hi> and therefore if the Act of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <note place="margin">

                        <p>Having now briefly diſcourſed of the Original, and Evangelical Nature of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrament of it, and the perſons that were initiated thereinto, I now proceed to make a few Obſervations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Alteration of it, from the <hi>Moſaical</hi> into the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> or from the Legal State of it under the Old Teſtament, into the Evangelical under the New.</p>
                        <p>For as it was the ſame for Subſtance under the Law that it was before it; ſo it ſtill remains the ſame for Subſtance under the Goſpel, that it was under the Law. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is the ſame, tho' the Superſtructure and Faſhion of the Houſe be very different. For <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſtill the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful; and we that believe under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are as much his Seed, and Children in God's prime Intention, and the true meaning of the Words, as thoſe that were Believers under the Law.</p>
                        <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that the Church-Chriſtian is called in the New Teſtament, the New and Supernal <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> to let us know, that Chriſtianity is nothing but Spiritual <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> the ſame City new reformed, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a new Charter, bleſſed with more noble and ample Priviledges than formerly; and every way better built, and more Auguſt than it was. Thus in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Unto him that overcometh</hi> (ſaith the Son of Man) <hi>I will write the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is New</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which is come down out of Heaven, from my God:</hi> that is, I will acknowledge him that holds out to the end for a perſon truly godly, and for a true Member of the pure Catholick Chriſtian-Church, which is the Spiritual <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſcended from above. And ſo Chap. 21. 2. <hi>I ſaw the Holy City New</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>coming down from God, down out of Heaven prepared as a</hi> Bride, <hi>adorned for her</hi> Husband, meaning <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt. So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>Jeruſalem which is from above,</hi> or the Supernal <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is [a] free [City] which is the Mother of us all.</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:518"/>
                        <p>Hence alſo it comes to paſs, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Epiſtle, calls the Chriſtians by thoſe proper Titles and Appellations which God gave unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> as unto his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, <hi>viz. a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar People;</hi> which muſt needs imply, that the Chriſtian Church is fundamentally, and radically the ſame with the ancient Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Accordingly St. <hi>Paul</hi> tho' he was the Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet compared the calling of them to the engrafting of the wild Olive-Tree into the old Olive-Trees Stock. If ſome of the Branches (ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">

From this Compariſon it is plain, that the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church are the ſame in the Root and Stock: And from this radical Argument that is betwixt them, it proceeds, that St. <hi>John</hi> in his Symbolical way of Writing in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> calls the Chriſtians <hi>Jews: Behold I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan which ſay they are Jews but are not,</hi> Rev. 3. 9. 2. 9. Indeed, as <hi>Judaiſm</hi> was nothing but myſtical Chriſtianity; ſo Chriſtianity is nothing but reformed <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> which made our Saviour, who was the Reformer of it, ſay unto the <hi>Jews, Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law, and the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to perfect and fulfil.</hi> And unto his Diſciples, who under him were to be Maſter-Builders of his Houſe, he ſaid, <hi>That a Scribe, or Doctor rightly inſtructed unto the Kingdom of God, was like a Man that is an Houſholder, who bringeth out of his Store-houſe things both new and old.</hi> Thereby ſhewing, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> obſerves, that he muſt be a <note place="margin">L. 4. c. 21. &amp; 43.</note> very skilful Scribe in the Old Teſtament, that was fit to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:519"/> make a Workman of the new. The Old Teſtament and legal Oeconomy was to be his Magazine, and Storehouſe, out of which he was to fetch many ſerviceable pieces for the new Building; and accordingly our Saviour, tho' in reforming the Houſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was fain to pull it down, that it might be enlarged, yet both he that began the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and his Apoſtles, who finiſhed it, like Men that were Houſe-holders, uſed much of the Old Timber and Materials, and conformed it too, as much as they could, after the manner of the old. <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm.</note> They introduced as much of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> into the Chriſtian Religion, as the nature of the Reformation would well bear, and adhered as much as they could to the old, both in the Matter and Form of the new <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> and laid by few <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, but ſuch as were fulfilled in Chriſt and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Antitype and Subſtance of them; or elſe ſuch as were inconſiſtent with the Nature of the Church-Chriſtian, as it was to be a manly, free, and univerſal Church.</p>
                        <p>Theſe were the two reaſons for which Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſo much altered the Face of the Church from what it was under the <hi>Moſaical Oeconomy,</hi> Firſt, becauſe very many of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremonies were <note n="†" place="margin">Ac primò ita his in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut antity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus in typi locum ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat, eumque adeo loco moveat, ut ſimul atque antitypus adſit, nullus deinceps typo locus, nullus uſus reperiatur. <hi>Outramus</hi> de Sacrificiis, Lib. 2. c. 16. p. 204.</note> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt and Chriſtianity; and Secondly, becauſe many of them were inconſiſtent with the nature of a manly, free and univerſal Church, ſuch as Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Then, many of the Eccleſiaſtical rites, and uſages of the <hi>Jews</hi> were laid aſide, at the time of Reformation, becauſe they were fulfilled in Chriſt, as the Antitype, and Subſtance of them, as is plain from the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. Let no man judge you in Meat, or in <hi>Drink,</hi> or in reſpect of an <hi>Holyday,</hi> or of the New <hi>Moons,</hi> or of the Sabbath days, which are a Shadow of things that are to come <hi>to paſs;</hi> but the Body is Chriſt: that is to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:519"/> ſay, Let no Man impoſe upon you the Doctrine of <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Abſtinence,</hi> or condemn you for eating and drinking things prohibited by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, or for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their Feaſts, New Moons and Sabbaths, which are but Types of Chriſtianity; and therefore ought to be laid aſide. The like he doth ſhew in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> concerning the Temple, Prieſthood, Altar, Sacrifices, and the whole Temple-Service; as is plain from many Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, whereof I ſhall recite ſome. The Prieſthood being changed, there is made alſo of neceſſity a change in the Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 22. The Holy Ghoſt, this <hi>ſignifying</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the way into the holieſt of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while, as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding, which was but a <hi>Figure</hi> for the time then preſent, in which were offered both Gifts and Sacrifices; that could not make him that did the Service perfect <hi>[and cleanſed]</hi> as pertaining to the Conſcience, which ſtood, or conſiſted only in a certain uſe of Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and other carnal Ordinances impoſed on them, <hi>[as Types]</hi> until the time of Reformation <hi>[by Chriſt] Chap.</hi> 9. 8, 9, 10. So <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. Chriſt <hi>[with the Blood of his Sacrifice]</hi> is not entred into the Holy Places made with Hands, which are the <hi>Figures</hi> of the true. And after all, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 1. the Law having only a Shadow of the good things to come, and not the Solidity of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, can never with thoſe <hi>[umbratical]</hi> Sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually make the Comers thereunto perfect.</p>
                        <p>It would make a Book of it ſelf, to recite all the Types and Shadows of the Old Teſtament, which are applied to Chriſt and Chriſtianity by the Writers under the New. Beſides what occurs in the Apoſtles Writings, there is much to the ſame purpoſe in the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which is very ancient; the Dialogue of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew;</hi> and the Fourth Book of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſiſting upon many typical things, and perſons in the Old Teſtament, at laſt concludes in the <hi>38th</hi> Chapter, <hi>Nihil enim vacuum, nihil ſine ſigno;</hi> that almoſt every thing in it was typical, and had a myſtical Reference to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the New.</p>

                        <p>But Secondly, as many of the Eccleſiaſtical Rites, and Uſages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church were taken away, becauſe they were fulfilled in Chriſt and Chriſtianity, ſo many others were annulled, as being inconſiſtent with the nature of the Church-Chriſtian, as it was to be a <hi>manly, free,</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, As it was to be a <hi>manly</hi> Church in oppoſition to the legal Pedagogy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> called it in ſaying, That <hi>the Law was but a School-maſter to bring them unto Chriſt</hi> [Gal. 3. 24] and that the <hi>Jews</hi> were under it as Children are under Tutors, and Governors, until the time appointed by the Father, the Fulneſs of Time, when God ſent forth his Son, <hi>[Chap.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.] Hither we may refer abundance of thoſe Precepts which concerned their Waſhings, and Purifications, or their Abſtinence from menſtruous Women, and unclean Creatures, which God impoſed upon them in that State of Minority, chiefly to lecture unto them moral Purity and Temperance: For they had childiſh Underſtandings, and were, like Children, to be inſtructed by Symbols, and Symbolical Leſſons, as is plain from the Precept about their Phylacteries, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 38. <hi>Speak unto the Children of Iſrael, and bid them that they make Fringes in the Borders of their Garments throughout their Generations, and that they put upon the Fringes of their borders, a Ribband of Blue, and it ſhall be unto you for a Fringe, that you may look upon it, and remember all the Commandments of the Lord, and do them, and that ye ſeek not after your own Heart, and your own Eyes, after which ye uſe to go a Whoring.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Secondly, As many of their Rites and Ceremonies were annulled at the time of Reformation, becauſe they were inconſiſtent with the manly nature of the Chriſtian Religion, ſo others were annulled, becauſe they were not conſiſtent with the free nature of it, in oppoſition to the Servile nature of the Jewiſh Church, which is excellently ſet forth by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22, <hi>&amp;c. Abraham</hi> had two Sons, the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but he that was born of the Bond-maid was born ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, but he that was born of the Free-woman,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:520"/> was born <hi>[by virtue of the]</hi> Promiſe <hi>which God made unto</hi> Abraham: Which things are an Allegory, for theſe <hi>[two Women]</hi> are the two Covenants. The one the Covenant which was made on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth to Bondage, and this was <hi>Agar.</hi> For this <hi>Agar</hi> is <hi>[the figure of]</hi> Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and anſwereth to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which now is, and is <hi>[ſtill]</hi> in Bondage with her Children. But [Sarah <hi>is the figure of the Spiritual]</hi> Jeruſalem, which is <hi>[come with Chriſt from]</hi> above, which is the Mother of us all.</p>
                        <p>Now this Eccleſiaſtical Bondage, and Servitude of the <hi>Jews,</hi> conſiſted in the vaſt number of their Religious Rites and Obſervances, which if a Man conſider in retail as to the Days, Weeks, Months, and Years, which they were bound to obſerve; the multitude of Sacrifices of all ſorts, which they were bound to offer; the frequent Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Purifications they were bound to undergo; the ſtrict diſtinction they were to make of clean from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Animals; the Rules and Ceremonies they were bound to obſerve at Births, Marriages, Burials, at Bed and Board, at Home and Abroad, in Sickneſs and in Health, nay, even in Plowing, Sowing, and Reaping, he ſhall find that they were left almoſt in nothing to their own Freedom and Diſcretion, but that the Obſervances, to which they were bound in almoſt all their Actions, took up half of their time.</p>
                        <p>Such a burdenſom and grievous Oeconomy was that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the <hi>Jews</hi> lived, but yet how ſevere and ſlaviſh ſoever it was, it was ſuitable to the ſlaviſh temper of that People, upon whom God impoſed all theſe Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for the hardneſs of their hearts, and propenſion to Idolatry, as <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>They were apt to forget God, and therefore he loaded them with ſo many Divine Rites and Obſervations, that at all times and places, and in every action, they might be put in mind of him, and this Ceremonial Yoke was ſo heavy upon them, that it was little leſs than intolerable, according to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Why tempt ye God to put a</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Hither therefore we are to refer the annulling not ſo much of any particular ſort of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies as of the whole Maſs of them, even the diſſolution of the whole Ceremonial Law, of which the <hi>Jews</hi> were grown weary, and with which they had been for a long time heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when Chriſt called them to take his Yoke and Burden upon them, which was to be ſo eaſie, and light.</p>
                        <p>But then in the laſt place, as the obligatory force of all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremonies were taken away, becauſe they were inconſiſtent with the free nature of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church: So ſome more eſpecially were annulled, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiſtent with the univerſality of it, as it was to be a Catholick Church.</p>

God injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them theſe, and other things in oppoſition to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Idolatrous Nations, that there might be a mutual ſtrangeneſs and hatred betwixt them, and that by theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:521"/> and other Ceremonial Singularities, they might be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt of the World. But then Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to break down the middle wall of Partition betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to aboliſh the Enmity of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that was betwixt them, that he might make Peace betwixt them, and reconcile them both into one Body in the Croſs, it was requiſite to this end, that he ſhould abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh theſe, and all other diſtinguiſhing Characters betwixt them, which would have hindred the Progreſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, had it been clogg'd with <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which were become ſo odious, and ridiculous to all the Gentile World.</p>
                        <p>In particular, For this reaſon he was obliged to change the Initiatory Sacrament, and the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, I mean <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> by which the <hi>Jews</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a few <note n="*" place="margin">The ancient Egyptians, Ethiopians, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites, Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians.</note> Nations) were diſtinguiſhed from all the World.</p>

                           </note> odious and ridiculous to all other People upon the account of it, and for this reaſon it would have been a mighty bar to the Progreſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, had the Gentiles been to be initiated thereby.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it alone was reckoned as a grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by reaſon of the painful and bloody nature of it; and for that Reaſon alſo was laid aſide, as being inconſiſtent with the free and eaſie nature of the Chriſtian Religion; for if <hi>Zipporah</hi> was ſo much offended at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and called him a bloody Husband upon the account of it, we may well preſume how much the Gentiles would have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the Apoſtles, and at their Doctrine, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof.</p>
                        <p>No Religious Rite could be more ungrateful to Fleſh and Blood, and therefore the Wiſdom of our Lord is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in changing of it into the eaſie and practicable Ceremony of Baptiſm; which was of more univerſal

                        <p>All theſe things I thought neceſſary to be diſcourſed [as <hi>Praecognita]</hi> to fit and prepare the Reader's mind to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the State of the Controverſie about Infant-Baptiſm, as it is propoſed in theſe five Comprehenſive Queſtions. 1. <hi>Whether Infants are uncapable of Baptiſm?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether they are excluded from Baptiſm by Chriſt?</hi> 3. <hi>Whether it is lawful to ſeparate from a Church which appointeth Infants to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?</hi> 4. <hi>Whether it be the duty of Chriſtian Parents to bring their Children unto Baptiſm?</hi> 5. <hi>Whether it is lawful to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with believers, who were Baptized in their Infancy?</hi> The whole merit of the Controverſie about Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, lies in theſe five Comprehenſive Queſtions, and I ſhall preſently proceed to the ſtating of them after I have ſhew'd, that Circumciſion was a Sacrament of equal <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy, Force,</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> with Baptiſm, and that Baptiſm ſucceeded in the room of it, not as the <hi>Antitype</hi> ſucceeded in the place of the <hi>Type,</hi> but as one poſitive Inſtitution ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the place of another, and this alſo is neceſſary to be foreknown by the Reader, becauſe the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhift off the force of many good Arguments, which otherwiſe are not to be evaded, by ſaying that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion under the Old Teſtament, was a Type of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm under the New.</p>
                        <p>Now to ſhew that Circumciſion was not a Type but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fore-runner of Baptiſm, we muſt note, that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly ſpeaking, there was the ſame difference betwixt the Type and the Antitype, as betwixt the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the Subſtance, or betwixt a Man and his Picture in a Glaſs; <note n="*" place="margin">Deinde (quod maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè adverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum) id inter Antitypum &amp; Typum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, quod quae <hi>revera</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titypo vis in eſt, ea non niſi ſpecie tenus, aut gradu longè exiliori in Typo extiterit. Enimvero quamvis Typus nonnunquam rem aliquam cum Antitypo ſuo communem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buerit, ea tamen res multò minùs in Typo, quam in Antitypo ſemper valet—ita ut vis rei adumbrantis virtutis in adumbratâ repertae nil niſi Symbolica quaedam Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, aut tam exilis gradus fuerit, ut pro umbrâ quâdam haberi poſſit. <hi>Outramus de Sacrif.</hi> l. 2. c. 18.</note> inſomuch, that what was really, literally, and properly in the Antitype, and of perfect Efficacy and Power, was generally, but Symbolically and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in the Type, and figurative of ſomething, which did in a more noble, perfect, eminent, and efficacious manner belong to the Antitype, than it did to it.</p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:523"/>
                        <p>Thus the blood of the Legal Sacrifices were but Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and Repreſentations of the Blood of Chriſt, and the purging and cleanſing Virtue in their Blood, ſerving to the purifying of the Fleſh, was alſo but a faint and umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reſemblance of the more noble and efficacious clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Virtue of his Blood which purges the Conſcience from dead works. So the Brazen Serpent was but a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or Symbol of Chriſt upon the Croſs, and the healing Virtue which, belonged to it, was but a figure, or ſhadow of that more eminent, and powerfully healing Virtue, which was in Jeſus Chriſt. But the caſe is not ſo betwixt Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Baptiſm, becauſe Circumciſion hath no Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal likeneſs with Baptiſm, nor any thing belonging to it common with Baptiſm, which doth not as literally, properly, fully, and eminently belong unto it, as unto Baptiſm it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>For Firſt, Is Baptiſm a Sacrament of initiation into the Covenant of Grace under the Goſpel? So was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before, and under the Law. Is Baptiſm now a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith? So was Circumciſion then. Doth it properly, and effectually confirm and eſtabliſh the Covenant betwixt God and us now? So did Circumciſion then, as it is written, you ſhall Circumciſe the Fleſh of your Fore-skin, and it ſhall be a Token of the Covenant betwixt me and you. Baptiſm doth nothing under the Goſpel, which Circumciſion did not as properly, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually under the Law. This was then as abſolute and real a Sacrament, as that now is. This did then as really initiate true Believers, as that now doth. It never was an Umbratical Sacrament, or ſhadow of another Sacrament, it never did Umbratically initiate Believers, or Umbrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and in ſhew and Similitude only confirm the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt God, and the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be a Type of Baptiſm, no more than the Broad Seal of <hi>England</hi> 300 Years ago was a Type of this.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly it is never mentioned in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a Type of Baptiſm, nor Baptiſm, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype of it; but on the contrary, the only Typical Adumbrations which are found of it in the Goſpel, are ſuch things, which have ſome Symbolical likeneſs

                        <p>But as for Circumciſion it hath nothing in it Symbolical of Baptiſm, nor was it an Umbratical, but a real Config<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Covenant of Grace, every way as real, and ſubſtantial an Ordinance, as Baptiſm now is, and therefore ſucceeded in the room of it, not as the Antitype did in the place of the Type, but as one abſolute Ordinance or poſitive Inſtitution doth in the place of another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtle, who ſaith unto the <hi>Coloſſians.—In whom alſo ye are Circumciſed, with the Circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, having been buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> Col. 2. 11, 12.</p>

                        <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let us proceed to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the former Queſtions. And firſt of all,</p>
                        <div n="1" type="question">
                           <head>Queſt. I. <hi>Whether Infants are uncapable of Baptiſm?</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>Which, conſidering what hath already been ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spiritual and Evangelical Nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the initiation of young Children into it by God's eſpecial appointment, cannot without raſhneſs be affirmed. Nothing can reflect more diſhonour upon the Wiſdom of God, and the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church than to aſſert Infants to be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſame privilege, which God, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church granted unto them. For God commanded them to be Circumciſed, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church commanded them to be Baptized, as well adult Proſelytes, and if they were then capable both of Circumciſion, and Baptiſm, ſurely they are capable of Baptiſm now.</p>
                           <p>If they be not, from whence comes the difference? Not from the Nature of the Covenants, for the Covenant, which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, was, as I have ſhew'd, the ſame Covenant for ſubſtance, which he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:525"/> hath ſince renew'd with us in Chriſt: Nor from the Signs and Seals of the Covenant; for Circumciſion was a Sign and Seal of the ſame Grace, or of the ſame Righteouſneſs of Faith under the Old Teſtament, that Baptiſm is now under the New.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, ſince the Covenants were for ſubſtance the ſame, both Spiritual and Evangelical Covenants, and the Grace of thoſe Covenants the very ſame, and only the Rites and Ceremonies which were Signs of thoſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and Seals of that Grace being different; what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the nature of the thing, but that Infants who were capable of the one, ſhould not alſo be capable of the other? Is Baptiſm a more Spiritual Ordinance than Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? That cannot be, becauſe Circumciſion is a Goſpel-Ordinance; I mean, an Ordinance of the Goſpel which God <hi>preached before unto</hi> Abraham, and if the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of outward Ordinances are to be meaſured from the ends of their inſtitution, then Circumciſion was every way as Spiritual as Baptiſm, becauſe it really ſigned the ſame Covenant, and ſealed the ſame Grace, and was a Ceremony of Initiation to the ſame Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Baptiſm now is.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, if the relative nature of Circumciſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Sacrament, was the ſame under the Law, that Baptiſm is under the Goſpel, it muſt needs follow, that Children under the Goſpel, are as capable of this (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no new Command to exclude them) as under the Law, they were of that; if Infant Church-Memberſhip, or the Initiation of Infants was then no abſurdity, ſurely it can be none now: If God under the Old Teſtament vouchſafed it as a gracious Priviledge unto Children to be incorporated with actual Believers, and with them to be made members of his Church; without a Prohibition to the contrary, they muſt needs be capable of the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge ſtill. Nay, if Infants were admitted into the Church, when the entrance into it was more grievous, and not without blood, how unreaſonable is it to aſſert, that they are now uncapable of admiſſion into it, when the entrance into it is made more eaſie, and more agreeable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:525"/> to the natural weakneſs of a young and tender Child? Certainly if the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infants were Circumciſed with the moſt painful and bloody Circumciſion made with hands, Chriſtian Infants, without a Special Countermand from God, muſt be deemed capable of the Circumciſion made without hands, I mean of Baptiſm, which is the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt. What God hath Sanctified, and Adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made a Member of his Church, let no Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to think it uncapable of Sanctification, Adoption, and Church-Memberſhip, but yet ſo raſh and extravagant have the profeſs'd Adverſaries of Infant-Baptiſm been, as to pronounce little Infants as uncapable of Baptiſm, as the young ones of unreaſonable Creatures, and that it is as vain to call upon God to ſend his Holy Spirit upon them, as to pray him to illuminate a Stone or a Tree.</p>
                           <p>Nay, upon this very Preſumption, that Infants are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Baptiſm, they aſſert Infant-Baptiſm to be a Scandalous abuſe of the Ordinance of Baptiſm, a meer Nullity and inſignificant performance, and ſcornfully call it <hi>Baby-Baptiſm,</hi> forgetting all this while that Circumciſion of Infants was no ſcandalous abuſe of the Ordinance of Circumciſion, but a valid and ſignificant Performance, and that in their Phraſe there was <hi>Baby-Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>Baby-Baptiſm</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon why they conclude Infants uncapable of Baptiſm, is taken from the conſideration of their incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to ſome ends and uſes of Baptiſm, which cannot be anſwered (ſay they) but by the Baptiſm of grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are capable of underſtanding the Goſpel, and of profeſſing their Faith, and Repentance, and of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto Baptiſm, and of having their Faith and Hope further ſtrengthned in the uſe of it; but Infants being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable of underſtanding the Goſpel, or of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Faith, and Repentance, and of ſubmitting unto Baptiſm in which they are meerly paſſive, or of having their Faith ſtrengthned in the uſe of it, they ought to be deemed uncapable of Baptiſm, whoſe ends are ſo much fruſtrated, when it is applied unto them.</p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:526"/>
                           <p>But this way of arguing, how plauſible ſoever it may ſeem at firſt hearing, is weak and fallacious, and highly reflecting upon the Council, and Wiſdom of God.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, It is weak and fallacious, becauſe it makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt a <hi>ſtrict inſtitution,</hi> which is inſtituted by God for one, or a few ends, and prociſely for Perſons of one ſort, and an <hi>Inſtitution of Latitude,</hi> which is inſtituted by him for ſeveral ends, and for different ſorts of Perſons differently qualified for thoſe ſeveral ends. Of the firſt ſort, was the <hi>Ordinance of Fringes</hi> above-mentioned, which could only concern grown Perſons, becauſe they only were capable of anſwering the end, for which it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, <hi>viz. To look upon them and remember the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord,</hi> and of the latter ſort is the Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Marriage, which was appointed by God for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ends, and for Perſons differently qualified, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated for thoſe ſeveral ends, in ſo much, that Perſons, who are incapacitated as to ſome ends of Marriage, may yet honeſtly Marry, becauſe they are capable of the reſt. All the ends and uſes, for which it was appointed can only be anſwered by the Marrying of Perſons who are capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated for procreation of <hi>Children,</hi> notwithſtanding ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated Perſons, who are paſt that capacity, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable Subjects of Marriage, nor is the Marriage of ſuch invalid, or an abuſe of the Holy Ordinance of Marriage, becauſe they are capable of anſwering one end, for which Marriage was ordained.</p>
                           <p>This ſhews how fallaciouſly the Anabaptiſts argue againſt Baptizing of Infants, becauſe of their incapacity as to ſome ends and uſes for which Baptiſm was ordained; they ought firſt to have proved, what they take for granted, that it was a Divine Inſtitution of the firſt ſort, which I call a <hi>ſtrict Inſtitution,</hi> and then their Argument had been good, but this they will never be able to prove, becauſe Baptiſm ſucceeded in the room of Circumciſion, which was a Divine Inſtitution of the latter ſort, and becauſe our Saviour was Baptiſed, in whom there was a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, as to the ends of Baptiſm, than poſſibly can be in <hi>Infants,</hi> even as he was in a greater incapacity as to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:526"/> anſwering the ends of Circumciſion, than ordinary <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Infants</hi> were. <hi>John</hi> verily did Baptize with the Baptiſm of Repentance, and thereby ſealed unto the People the Remiſſion of their Sins, and therefore underſtanding very well that our Lord was not capable of this, and other ends of his Baptiſm, he forbad him, telling him, that he was fitter to be the Baptiſt, than to be Baptized of him; but yet as ſoon as our Lord gave him one general reaſon why he ought to be Baptized, <hi>viz. Becauſe it became him to fulfil all Righteouſneſs,</hi> he ſuffered him, which ſhews that Baptiſm is a Divine <hi>Inſtitution of Latitude,</hi> and that in ſuch an <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> the incapacity of a Perſon, as to ſome ends, doth not incapacitate him for it, when he is capable of the reſt.</p>
                           <p>But Secondly, This way of arguing from the incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Infants,</hi> as to ſome ends of Baptiſm is highly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Wiſdom of God; who commanded young Babes to be Circumciſed, although all the ends of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion could not be anſwered, but by the Circumciſion of adult Perſons, who only were capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> into which they were to enter, of profeſſing their Faith and Repentance, and of ſubmitting unto the bloody Sacrament, in which Children were merely Paſſive, and of having their Faith and Hope further ſtrengthned upon ſealing unto them the Remiſſion of their Sins.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, the full force of this Objection riſes up againſt <hi>Infant-Circumciſion,</hi> as well as <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was inſtituted for the ſame ends, that Baptiſm now is, and accordingly when Men were initiated by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion they were to profeſs their Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſhortly after at their Baptiſm ſolemnly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Idolatry, and all idolatrous Manners and Worſhip, and their idolatrous Kindred and Relations; and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deſire of ſuch Proſelytes, their Children were initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated both by Circumciſion, and Baptiſm, though they were altogether uncapable of underſtanding, or doing thoſe things which their Fathers did.</p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:527"/>
                           <p>Wherefore, thoſe Men who argue againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe it doth not anſwer all the ends of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Divine Wiſdom, and the Wiſdom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, not conſidering, that Circumciſion was, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is an Inſtitution of <hi>great Latitude</hi> and compaſs, deſigned on purpoſe by God for Children, in whom there is a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ſome, nay, for the <note n="*" place="margin">Rem Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puam in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo non at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendunt, hoc eſt reſtificationem divinae benevolentiae in foedus &amp; tutelam ſuam ſuſcipientis &amp; gratiam conferentis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nam in Baptiſmo praecipua res eſt divina gratia, quae conſiſtit in remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione peccatorum, regeneratione, adoptione, haereditate Vitae aeternae, cujus ſane gratiae Infantes &amp; indigentes &amp; capaces ſunt. <hi>Caſſand. de Bapt.

                           <p>They are capable of all the ends of it, as it is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a Sign from God towards us, to aſſure us of his Gracious favour, and to conſign unto us the benefits of the Covenant of Grace. For their Child-hood doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that they may be made Members of the Church, as of a Family, Tribe, Colledge, or any other Society, nor doth it incapacitate them any more from being adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Children of God, than the Children of any other Perſon, nor of becoming Heirs of Eternal Life by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Adoption, than by vertue of any other civil Adoption, the Heirs to ſuch a Temporal Eſtate. For Children are capable of all acts of Favour and Honour from God and Men, and of being inſtated in all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of any Society, though they cannot as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duties of it, nor underſtand any thing thereof. Since therefore, Children are as capable, and ſtand as much in need of almoſt all the Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, and the Priviledges of Church Memberſhip as Men, is it not as fit that the Confirmatory Sign of thoſe <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> ſhould be applied unto them as well as unto theſe? Should a Prince Adopt a <hi>Beggar</hi>'s Child, and incorporate him into the Royal Family, and ſettle a part of his Dominions upon him, and to ſolemnize and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm all this, ſhould cut off a bit of his Fleſh, or command him to be waſhed with Water, who would count this an inſignificant Solemnity, or ſay, that the <hi>Child</hi> was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:527"/> of the Sign, when he was capable of the chief Things ſignified thereby? Or to make a Compariſon, which hath a nearer ſemblance with <hi>the Caſe of Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</hi> Suppoſe a Prince ſhould ſend for an attainted Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's <hi>Child,</hi> and in the Preſence of ſeveral Perſons aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for that purpoſe, ſhould ſay: <hi>You know the Blood of this Child is attainted by his Fathers Treaſon, by Law he hath forfeited all Right to his Anceſtors Eſtate, and Titles, and is quite undone, though he be not ſenſible of his wretched Condition. My Bowels of Compaſſion yern upon him, and here I reſtore him to his Blood and Inheritance, to which henceforward he ſhall have as much right, as if the Family had never been attainted. I juſtifie him freely, and declare my ſelf reconciled unto him, and that no ſpot or imputation may hereafter lay upon him, I here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you all waſh him with pure water, to ſignifie that he is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his Original Attaindure and Corruption of Blood, and that he is as fully reſtored to his Birth-right, as if he had never been Attaint.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now ſuppoſe this were done for a poor attainted Infant, could any Man ſay that the action was inſignificant, and invalid, becauſe the Child knew nothing of it, or that he was incapable of the Sign, when he was capable of being waſhed from the Attaindure, and of being thereby reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his blood, and Birth-right, which was the chief thing ſignified thereby?</p>
                           <p>Theſe things ſhould be well conſidered by the Deſpiſers of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> againſt whom I may urge for Precedents the Circumciſion, and Baptiſm of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, both theſe, as I muſt often obſerve, were applied unto Infants as well as adult, and actual Believers under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and accordingly, tho' <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly profeſſed his Faith before he was Circumciſed, yet I hope they will not ſay that God acted fooliſhly, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi> to be Circumciſed before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ends of Circumciſion, or could believe, much leſs make profeſſion of his Belief. He was entered Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally into Covenant with God before he was able to recontract, or underſtand what the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was, but yet I preſume they will not ſay he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:528"/> in vain, although he was under the very ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity as to the ends of Circumciſion, that Infants are of Baptiſm now.</p>
                           <p>The beſt way, that I know, they have of evading the force of this Argument, is by ſaying, that Circumciſion was more proper for Infants than Baptiſm, becauſe it left a ſignificant Mark, and Character in their Fleſh, whereas Baptiſm is a tranſient Sign, and leaves no ſignificant Impreſſion behind it, whereby to inſtruct Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men what was done unto them in their Infancy. But this is a meer ſhift:</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Mark, and Character, which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion left in the Fleſh of the Child, was as inſignificant to him during the time of his Non-age, as Baptiſm is to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Infants,</hi> neither afterwards could he tell, but by the inſtruction of others, what the meaning of that Character was, and for what ends it was imprinted in his Fleſh. And therefore, according to their way of reaſoning againſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,</hi> it ought to have been deferred till the full years of diſcretion, when the Circumciſed Perſon might have underſtood the Spiritual Signification thereof.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore, in anſwer to this Objection, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them, that the Mark and Character which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion left behind it, was of no force, or ſignification, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it did appear from the <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p>I ſay, the <hi>Character</hi> which <hi>Circumciſion</hi> left behind it, was merely of it ſelf of no force nor ſignification without the Regiſters, or written <hi>Genealogies,</hi> becauſe without them neither the circumciſed Perſon himſelf, nor the <hi>Church</hi> could know in many <hi>Circumſtances</hi> whether he were a true Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or an <hi>Egyptian, Iſmaelite,</hi> or <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who were all <hi>Circumciſed</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews.</hi> If <hi>Baptiſm</hi> then be a <hi>Tranſient, Circumciſion</hi> was an <hi>Equivocal</hi> Sign, and therefore theſe pretended circumſtantial Differences ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, nor make any ſubſtantial difference betwixt <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as to the capacity of <hi>Infants</hi> unto both. They are capable of contracting a Spiritual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto God by this, as formerly they were by that; they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:528"/> are capable of having their Spiritual attaindure removed; they are capable of receiving the Bleſſings of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> tho' they cannot perform the duties of it, and God may ſolemnly bind himſelf unto them, tho' they cannot as yet perſonally bind themſelves unto him.</p>
                           <p>But Secondly, Allowing that Circumciſion was more proper for Infants, than Baptiſm, yet this difference is wholly avoided by referring the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm not only unto Infant. Circumciſion, but unto the Original Practice of Infant-Baptiſm in the <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> which underſtood very well, that it was but a tranſient rite, and left no Character upon the perſon, who was initiated thereby. Thoſe therefore who take upon them to argue againſt Infant-Baptiſm from this or any other pretended reaſon, take upon them to cenſure, and condemn the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which for many Ages Baptiſed Infants, and Minor Proſelytes into the Covenant, as well as actual Believers, and yet were never cenſured, or reproved for it by any Prophet, which we may preſume they would have been, had Baptiſmal Initiation of Infants into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant been ſo abſurd, inſignificant, and abuſive a practice, as the Profeſſors againſt Infant-Baptiſm vainly pretend it is.</p>
                           <p>Having now, I hope, ſufficiently proved, that Infants are not uncapable Subjects of Baptiſm. Let us proceed to ſtate the next Queſtion, which is this.</p>

                           <p>Where, in the firſt place, I muſt obſerve, that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ought to be propoſed in theſe Terms, and not <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt hath commanded Infants to be Baptized?</hi> For as a good <note n="*" place="margin">Herodot. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.</note> Author obſerves of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> that we ought not to ask the reaſon, <hi>Why</hi> Nile <hi>overflows ſo many days about the Summer-ſolſtice?</hi> But rather <hi>Why it doth not overflow all the Year long?</hi> So in the Controverſie about Infant-Baptiſm, the enquiry ought not to be, whether Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Infants to be Baptized? But whether he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them from Baptiſm? Becauſe, conſidering the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church as to Infant-Circumciſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:529"/> and Infant-Baptiſm too, it muſt needs be granted, that a Command from Chriſt, to initiate Proſelytes out of all Nations into the Chriſtian Religion, muſt without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the contrary, be underſtood to comprehend In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as well as Men.</p>
                           <p>As for Example, ſuppoſe our Saviour had not changed the Seal of the Covenant, but inſtead of <hi>Baptizing,</hi> had ſaid unto the Apoſtles, <hi>Go, and make all Nations my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets</hi> Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>A. C. p.</hi> 100.</note> Circumciſing <hi>them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I appeal to any Impartial Man's judgment, whether the Apoſtles receiving ſuch a Commiſſion to Circumciſe Proſelytes of all Nations, would not have preſumed without directions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it was Chriſt's Intention that the Infants of adult Proſelytes ſhould be Circumciſed as well as Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes themſelves, according to the Commandment of God under the Old Teſtament, and the Practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>And if a command to Proſelyte and Circumciſe all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would, without an exception, have comprehended Infants, as well as Men, why ſhould it be imagined that the command to Proſelyte and Baptize all Nations ſhould not likewiſe comprehend them, ſeeing that Infant-Baptiſm, as well as Infant-Circumciſion had been the immemorial Practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>This is ſo true, that ſuppoſing our Saviour had intended the gathering of Churches among the Gentiles according to the Old Teſtament, and the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, he need not have expreſſed his meaning in any other manner, than by ſaying unto the Apoſtles; <hi>Go Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte all Nations,</hi> Circumciſing <hi>and</hi> Baptiſing <hi>of them,</hi> &amp;c. Nay he could ſcarce have expreſſed his Intentions in a more emphatical or intelligible manner unto them, who being <hi>Jews</hi> muſt needs have the ſame Apprehenſions as to the Subjects of Initiation, and Church-Memberſhip under the Goſpel, that they had under the Law. They had lived under a Diſpenſation, where Infants were initiated both by Circumciſion and Baptiſm into the Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they had been inſtructed to the contrary, they muſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:529"/> naturally have underſtood their Commiſſion of Baptizing to have extended unto Infants, as well as actual Believers; as if, for inſtance, God ſhould now extraordinarily call twelve Men of any Chriſtian Nation, where Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm had been a conſtant and univerſal Practice, and bid them <hi>go, and Proſelyte the</hi> Indians, <hi>baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. None of theſe Men could poſſibly imagine, that Infants were excepted out of their Commiſſion; but common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Beſides, abſtracting at preſent from the Controverſie, Whether Chriſt did, or did not exclude Infants from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? What reaſon can any Man give, why he who fetched ſo many of his Inſtitutions from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> uſages, ſhould exclude them from it, and recede in this Point from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>They are every way as capable of the viſible Signs of Gods inviſible favour, and of the Benefits of the <hi>Abrahami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Covenant under the New Teſtament, as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old, they are as fit Subjects of Baptiſm now, as they were of Circumciſion and Baptiſm then, their initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into both Churches ſeems to be equally rational, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though the ſign of the Covenant be altered, yet the Covenant ſtill remains the ſame. In a word, there lay no Obligation upon our <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi> to lay aſide the practice of Infant-Baptiſm, as being inconſiſtent either with the <hi>Free,</hi> or the <hi>Manly,</hi> or <hi>Univerſal</hi> nature of the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus much I have ſaid to ſhew, why the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Diſſenters upon the account of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> ſhould be, <hi>Whether Chriſt hath excluded Infants from Baptiſm?</hi> And not <hi>Whether he hath commanded Infants to be Baptized?</hi> And certainly, the Premiſes being conſidered, there is far more reaſon to conclude, that Chriſt ſhould have prohibited Infants from Baptiſm, if it had been his intention not to have them Baptized, than that he ſhould have commanded them to be Baptized, if it had been his intention to continue the practice of Infant-Baptiſm. For he need not have commanded his Apoſtles to do that,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:530"/> which they would naturally have done of themſelves without a Prohibition, and that he did not prohibit them to Baptize Infants, is now the thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in ſhewing, that he did not exclude Infants from Baptiſm.</p>
                           <p>For if he excluded them from Baptiſm, he either exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them from it directly by an expreſs Prohibition not to Baptiſe them, or conſequentially by ſo limiting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the Subject of Baptiſm, as to make it unapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto them.</p>
                           <p>That he never excluded them by any expreſs Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> themſelves do grant, becauſe there is no ſuch Prohibition to be found in the New Teſtament; but then they pretend, that it was Chriſt's intention that grown Perſons ſhould be the only Subjects of Baptiſm, becauſe the Goſpel requires, that Perſons to be Baptized ſhould firſt be <hi>Taught, Believe,</hi> and <hi>Repent.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Firſt, The Goſpel requires, that they ſhould be Taught, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 29. <hi>Go and teach all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That they ſhould believe, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and Preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He that Believeth, and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Repentance, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Repent, and be Baptized every one of you in the Name of</hi> Jeſus.</p>
                           <p>But now, ſay they, theſe three Qualifications before Baptiſm, can belong to none but grown Perſons, to Men and Women, at years of diſcretion, and therefore none but ſuch ought to be Baptized. And accordingly, we find that Baptiſm was practiſed upon theſe terms throughout the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Repentance and Faith are mentioned as prerequiſite qualifications to Baptiſm in theſe Words, <hi>Not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from deadly works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Baptiſms.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe are the Arguments, by which the Adverſaries of Infant-Baptiſm endeavour to prove, that Chriſt ſo limited the ſubject of Baptiſm, as to exclude Infants from it. But in this they are grievouſly miſtaken, becauſe theſe, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:530"/> the like Texts do of themſelves no more prove, that grown perſons are the only Subjects of Baptiſm, than the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. prove that grown Perſons only are to eat. The Apoſtles words are theſe: <hi>When we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat.</hi> From whence in their Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way it may be argued thus.</p>
                           <p>It belongs only to grown Perſons to eat, becauſe the Apoſtle requires, that Perſons who eat, ſhould firſt Work; but now this Apoſtolical qualification of working can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none but grown Perſons, and therefore none but ſuch ought to eat.</p>
                           <p>I have made uſe of this Parallel inſtance to ſhew how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive the former way of arguing againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is in it ſelf, and how impoſſible it is to prove from the Texts above-mentioned, or any other like them, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is reſtrained to grown Perſons, becauſe none but grown Perſons can be Taught, Believe, and Repent. And I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcover the weakneſs and fallacy of this Argument from a familiar Compariſon, which any common Capacity may underſtand.</p>
                           <p>Suppoſe then there were a great Plague in any Country, and God ſhould miraculouſly call eleven, or twelve Men, and Communicate unto them a certain Medicine againſt this Plague, and ſay unto them: <hi>Go into ſuch a Country, and call the People of it together, and teach them the Virtues of this Medicine, and aſſure them, that he that believeth, and taketh it from you, ſhall Live, but he that believeth not, ſhall Dye.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Upon this Suppoſition I demand of theſe Diſſenters, if the words of ſuch a Commiſſion would be ſufficient for the Miſſioners that received it, or any others to conclude, that it was God's intention, that they ſhould adminiſter his revealed Medicine to none, but grown Perſons, <hi>Becauſe they only could be called together, and taught the Virtues of it, and believe or disbelieve them who brought it.</hi> No certainly, this way of arguing would not be admitted by any rational Man, becauſe the Children would be as capable of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as the Men, though they were ignorant of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it, and merely paſſive in the Adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:531"/>
                           <p>Wherefore ſeeing Children, as I have ſhewed, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the benefits of Baptiſm, and ſeeing the Apoſtles who received a Commiſſion to go and Teach, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all Nations, Or, as it is in the words of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> to Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, ſaying, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I ſay, ſeeing Children are capable of the benefits of Baptiſm, and the Apoſtles, who received this Commiſſion, knew them to be capable of it, and to have had both Circumciſion, and Baptiſm adminiſtred to them in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, how ſhould they, or any others imagine from the tenure of ſuch a Commiſſion, which was given unto them, as Planters of Churches, but that it was Chriſt's intention that Children, as well as grown Perſons were to be Baptized?</p>
                           <p>Should God in the days of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eleven or twelve Prophets, and given them the ſame Commiſſion, which <hi>[Mutatis Mutandis]</hi> Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, bidding them go and Teach all Nations the Law, Circumciſing, and Baptizing of them in the Name of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and teaching them to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had commanded them, I ſay, ſhould he have ſent them out to Preach the Law to every Creature, ſaying, <hi>He that believeth, and is Circumciſed, and baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> would a Commiſſion ſo worded have been of it ſelf a ſufficient ground for them to think, that it was God's intention to reſtrain Circumciſion and Baptiſm to adult Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church? Or, if in a ſhort Hiſtory of their Miſſion, and Undertaking, we ſhould have read, that they Circumciſed, and Baptized as many Proſelytes, as gladly received their word, would this have been an Argument that they did not alſo Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Baptize the Infants of thoſe believing Proſelytes, according to the Laws, and Uſages of their Mother-Church? No certainly, ſuch a Commiſſion to Proſelyte Strangers to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, could not in reaſon have been ſtrained to prejudice the cuſtomary right of Infants to Circumciſion, and Baptiſm, and therefore in parity of reaſon, neither could the Apoſtles ſo underſtand their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:531"/> Commiſſion without other Notices, as to exclude Infants from Sacramental Initiation into the Church.</p>
                           <p>The plain truth is, their Commiſſion was a direction how they ſhould proſelyte Strangers to Chriſtianity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of propagating a new Religion in ſtrange Countries, as it is ſet forth by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 20. 14. <hi>How then ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? And how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they Preach unleſs they be ſent?</hi> Accordingly they were ſent out to Preach, or to Diſciple Men, and Women by Preaching, and to Baptize as many of them, as ſhould upon their Preaching Believe, and Repent. But though the Order of Nature required that they ſhould proceed in this Method with grown Perſons; as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to do with Proſelytes to the Law, yet it did not hinder, that they who had been born, and bred <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiate the Infants of ſuch Proſelyted Perſons, according to the uſage of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. What need Chriſt have ſaid more unto them, when he ſent them out, than to bid them <hi>Go, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the</hi> Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, to <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and tell them, <hi>that he that would believe the Goſpel, and be Baptized, ſhould be ſaved.</hi> But then the reſpective ſence of theſe words could only concern adult Perſons, and their qualification for Baptiſm, but could in no reaſon be conſtrued by them, to exclude Infants, but only unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Men, and Women, whereof none were to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church by Baptiſm, before they were taught Chriſtianity, and had confeſſed their Faith and Sins. Should God, as I ſaid before, call twelve Men of any Church, where Infant-Baptiſm had been the conſtant and undoubted practice, and bid them go, and Preach the Goſpel in the <hi>Indies</hi> to every creature, and to ſay, <hi>He that believeth the Doctrine which we Preach, and is Baptized with the Baptiſm which we Adminiſter, ſhall be Saved:</hi> I appeal to any Diſſenter upon the account of Infant-Baptiſm, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thinks that theſe Men, bred up to the practice of Infant-Baptiſm, could in probability ſo interpret this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
                              <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:532"/> as to think, that it was God's intention, that they ſhould exclude the Infants of believing Proſelytes from Baptiſmal admiſſion into the <hi>Church.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Profeſſors againſt Infant-Baptiſm, put the greateſt ſtreſs upon theſe words of our Saviour: <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be Saved:</hi> But if they would well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the next words, they would find, that Infants are not at all concerned in them, becauſe it follows, <hi>but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be Damned.</hi> The ſame want of Faith, which here excludes from Baptiſm, excludes alſo from Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and therefore it cannot be underſtood of Infants, unleſs they will ſay with the <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p>Thus far have I proceeded to ſhew, how <hi>inconcluſively</hi> and <hi>abſurdly</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> go about to prove, that <hi>Infants</hi> ought to be excluded from Baptiſm from the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Texts, which ſpeak of the Order of Proſelyting <hi>grown Perſons,</hi> and their Qualifications for Baptiſm; and as little ſucceſs have they with ſome others, which they bring to ſhew how <hi>unprofitable</hi> Baptiſm is for Infants, as that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. Where the Apoſtle tells us, that external Baptiſm <hi>of putting away the filth of the Fleſh,</hi> of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are only capable, ſignifies nothing, <hi>but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> of which, ſay they, Infants are altogether uncapable; to which the anſwer is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that another Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>external Circumciſion</hi> of which Infants were only capable, <hi>profited nothing without keeping the Law,</hi> which Infants could not keep, nay, that the <hi>outward Circumciſion,</hi> of which Infants were only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>was nothing,</hi> but that the <hi>inward Circumciſion of the heart, and in the ſpirit was the true Circumciſion,</hi> and yet <hi>Infants</hi>
                              <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:532"/> remaining <hi>Infants</hi> were utterly uncapable of that; ſo that their way of arguing from this and ſuch like Texts, proves nothing, becauſe it proves too much, and ſtretches the words of the Apoſtles unto undue conſequences, beyond their juſt Meaning, which was only to let both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians know, that there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in external Circumciſion, or Baptiſm, but not that their Infants were unprofitably Circumciſed, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                           <p>So weak, and unconcluding are all the Arguments, by which the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> endeavour from Scripture, to prove, that Chriſt hath limited the Subject of Baptiſm unto grown Perſons; put them all together they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to any tolerable degree of probability, much leſs unto a preſumption, eſpecially if they be put in the ballance againſt the early and univerſal practice of the Catholick Church. Had not the Church been always in poſſeſſion of this practice, or could any time be ſhewed on this ſide the Apoſtles, when it began. Nay, could it be proved, that any one Church in the World did not Baptize Infants, or that any conſiderable number of Men otherwiſe Orthodox, did decline the Baptizing of them upon the ſame Principles, that theſe Men do now, then I ſhould ſuſpect that their Arguments are better than really they are, and that Infant-Baptiſm might poſſibly be a deviation from the rule of Chriſt. But ſince it is ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and ancient a practice, that no body knows when, or where it began, or how from not being it came to be the practice of the Church, ſince there was never any Church Antient or Modern, which did not practiſe it, it muſt argue a ſtrange partiality to think, that it could be any thing leſs, than an Apoſtolical Practice, and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Original uſe of Baptiſm in its full Latitude under the Goſpel, which it had under the Law. <hi>Had the</hi>

                              <hi>Menno,</hi> one of the moſt learned of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> about the time of the Reformation, was ſo preſſed with this way of arguing, that he acknowledged Infant-Baptiſm to be as old, as the time of the Apoſtles, but then he ſaid, it proceeded from falſe-Apoſtles, and falſe-Teachers in the Apoſtles times. But if it came firſt from falſe Apoſtles, and falſe-Teachers, in the time of the Apoſtles, how came it to paſs that we heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Innovation in the Writings of the Apoſtles or of their Companions and Contemporaries, ſuch as St. <hi>Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> &amp;c? How came St. <hi>John</hi> who ſurvived unto the latter end of the firſt Century to paſs it over in ſilence, or how came the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Revelations, which by his Pen reproved ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abuſes in the Churches, not to cenſure this? It is very ſtrange, that none of the Pen-men of the Holy-Ghoſt, nor none of their Aſſiſtants, and Companions ſhould animadvert upon ſo ſcandalous an abuſe of the Holy-Ordinance of Baptiſm, which in a ſhort time would fill the Church with ſham Chriſtians, and deſtroy the Eſſence thereof. In like manner, if it came in by falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the next Age to the Apoſtles, how came it to paſs that none of the famous Saints and Martyrs, who flouriſhed then, oppoſed it as a dangerous Innovation, nor gave us any account thereof?

                           <p>But ſecondly, If Infant-Baptiſm was not an Apoſtolical Tradition, or were derivable from any thing leſs than Apoſtolical Practice, how came the <note n="a" place="margin">

                              <hi>Pelagians</hi> not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it for an <hi>Innovation,</hi> ſeeing the Orthodox uſed it, as an Argument againſt them, that Infants were guilty of <hi>Original Sin</hi> It had been eaſie for them, had there been any ground for it, to ſay that it was an Innovation crept into Practice ſince the time of the Apoſtles, or that it was brought up by Falſe-Apoſtles, and Falſe-Teachers in the Apoſtles Times, but then they were ſo far from doing this, which they would have been glad to do upon any colourable Pretence, that they practiced it themſelves, and owned it for an Apoſtolical Tradition, and as neceſſary for <hi>Childrens obtaining the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> tho they denied that they were Baptized for the Remiſſion of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin.</p>
                           <p>But thirdly, If Infant-Baptiſm were not in Practice, from the firſt Plantation of Chriſtian Churches, or were derivable from any other Cauſe than Apoſtolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let the Oppoſers of it tell us any other probable way how it came to be the uniform practice of all Churches, not only of ſuch as were Colonies of the ſame Mother-Church, or had Correſpondence with one another by their Biſhops, and Presbyters, but of ſuch as were Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Plantations, and betwixt which there was likely none, or but very little Communication, by reaſon of the vaſt diſtance, and want of intercourſe betwixt the Countries where <note n="b" place="margin">

It is very incredible, that God ſhould ſuffer all Churches in all the Parts of the World to fall into one and the ſame Practice, which certainly is a Church-deſtroying Practice, if the Apoſtles and their Aſſiſtants did not Baptize Infants, but only grown Perſons.</p>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:537"/>
                           <p>One may eaſily imagine, that God might ſuffer all Churches to fall into ſuch an harmleſs Practiſe as that of Infant-Communion, or that the Fathers of the Church might comply with the Religious fondneſs of the People, in bringing their Children to the Sacrament, as we do with bringing them to <hi>Prayers,</hi> but that God ſhould let them all (not preſerving any one for a Monument of Apoſtolical Purity) fall into a Practice, which deſtroys the <hi>Being</hi> of the Church, is at leaſt a thouſand times more Incredible, than that the Apoſtles, without a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Chriſt to the contrary, (and no ſuch Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Extant in the New Teſtament) ſhould Baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants according to the Practiſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>But in the fourth Place, what Account can rationally be given, why the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, who were offended at the neglect of Circumciſion, ſhould not have been much more offended, if the Apoſtles had refuſed to <hi>initiate</hi> Children under the New Teſtament, which had always been initiated under the Old. Is it reaſonable to believe, that thoſe, who complained ſo much meerly becauſe the Apoſtles Taught the <hi>Jews,</hi> which lived among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they ſhould not Circumciſe their Children, would not have complained much more if they had not Baptized them, but quite excluded them, like the Infants of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers from Admiſſion into the Church. It muſt in all probability have galled them very much to ſee their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Treated like the Children of meer Strangers, and to have had no viſible difference put between the Infants of thoſe that Embraced, and thoſe that reſiſted the Faith. For they always looked upon <hi>Pagan</hi> Children, as Common, and Unclean, but upon their own, as <hi>Separate,</hi> and <hi>Holy;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the ſame diſtinction between them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. But had the Apoſtles taught, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe, who were in Covenant with God, had no more right unto Baptiſmal Initiation, than the Children of <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who were out of the Covenant, they had Taught a Doctrine, which certainly would have offended them more, than all they Preached againſt Circumciſion, and keeping the Ceremonial Law. Wherefore, ſince we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:537"/> never read among their many Complaints upon the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> Cuſtoms, that they complained of their Childrens not being initiated by Baptiſm, it is a greater preſumption that the Apoſtles, and their Aſſiſtants Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed their Children, then the want of an Expreſs Example of Infant-Baptiſm in the New Teſtament, is that they Baptized them not.</p>
                           <p>Having now ſhewed, firſt, that Infants are not uncapable of Baptiſm.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, That they are not excluded from it by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but that on the contrary, we have very convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to preſume, that the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants,</hi> as well as of grown Perſons, was intended by him. Let us now proceed to make a fair and impartial enquiry upon the Third Queſtion.</p>

                        <div n="3" type="question">

                           </head>
                           <p>And this, conſidering what I have ſaid upon the former Queſtions, muſt be determined in the Negative, <hi>Whether we conſider Infant-Baptiſm only as a thing lawful, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> or, <hi>as a Thing highly requiſite, or neceſſary to be done.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I know very well, that my Adverſaries, in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, will be apt to deny this diſtinction betwixt <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> as acknowledging nothing in Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be lawful, but what is neceſſary, according to that common Principle imbibed by all ſorts of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> That <hi>nothing is to be appointed in Religious matters, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by ſome Precept, or directed unto by ſome ſpecial Example in the Word of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Hence they ordinarily ſay, Can you ſhew us any Precept or Example for Baptizing Infants in the New Teſtament, if you can, we will grant, that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is lawful, but if you cannot, we diſallow it as unlawful, nay, as an <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> and will never be of a Church, which ſo Uſurpeth it over the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men.</p>
                           <p>This way of Arguing is plauſible to the Vulgar, and would be very good, were there ſuch a Principle in the Scripture, as this, from whence they Argue, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>nothing is to be appointed in Religious matters, but what is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted</hi>
                              <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:538"/> 
                              <hi>by Precept, or Example in the Word of God.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Men with whom I have to deal in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, are generally Perſons of good natural <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So in the Firſt place, I beg them to conſider, that there is no ſuch Rule in the Scripture, as this, and therefore thoſe, who teach it for a Scripture-rule, or Precept, do themſelves impoſe upon Mens <hi>Conſciences,</hi> as bad as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and, like them and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, teach the Traditions of Men for Doctrines of God. On the contrary, the Goſpel tells us, that <hi>Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of a Law,</hi> and <hi>that where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and according to this plain, and intelligible Rule, though the Baptizing of <hi>Infants</hi> were not commanded in the Scriptures, yet the Church would have Power and Authority to appoint it; upon ſuppoſition that it is not forbid.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, I deſire them to conſider the abſurdity of this pretended Scripture-rule, in that it takes away the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt <hi>barely lawful,</hi> or allowable, and neceſſary, and leaves no Negative mean betwixt <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſinful,</hi> but makes things forbidden, and things not commanded to be the very ſame.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, I deſire them to conſider, what a ſlaviſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple this is, and how <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> it is with the free, and manly nature of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> under which we ſhould be in a far more ſervile, and Childiſh condition, then the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Law, which as it is evident from the Feaſt of Purim, and <hi>from the Inſtitution of Baptiſm among the</hi> Jews, allowed private Perſons to practice, and the Church to appoint things of a Religious nature, which God had not commanded to be done.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, I entreat them to conſider, how utterly impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable this pretended Principle is, as might be proved from the contrary Practice of all thoſe, who advance it againſt Eccleſiaſtical Authority, and particularly from their own Practice, in Baptizing grown Perſons, who were bred up from <hi>Infants</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and in admitting Women to the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> who were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>to the Paſsover, nor Paſchal-cup of Bleſſing,</hi> without
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52190:538"/> any Precept, or Preſident for ſo doing in the Word of God.</p>
                           <p>This little well conſidered, is enough to obviate all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt my firſt Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſeparate from a Church which appointeth Infants to be Baptized,</hi> upon ſuppoſition, <hi>that</hi> Infant-Baptiſm <hi>is barely lawful, and allowable;</hi> but if any man deſire further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as to this point, he may have it abundantly in <hi>the caſe of indifferent things,</hi> to which I refer him, it being more my buſineſs to ſhew here that <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> is at leaſt, a lawful, and allowable thing.</p>
                           <p>To prove this, I need but deſire the Reader to reflect upon the State of the two firſt Queſtions: For if Infants be as capable of Baptiſm under the Goſpel, as they were of Circumciſion under the Law, and if Chriſt have not excluded them from it neither directly, nor conſequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: Otherwiſe, if Baptiſm be an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of as great Latitude in its ſelf, as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> its <hi>Fore-runner</hi> was, and Chriſt hath not determined the adminiſtration of it to one Age, more than one Sex: Once more, if Children may be taken into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, under the Goſpel, as well as under the Law, and Chriſt never ſaid, nor did any thing which can in reaſon be interpreted to forbid them to be taken in: In a word, If they are capable of all the Ends of Baptiſm now, that they were of Circumciſion then, and of having the Priviledges of Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Bleſſings of the <hi>Covenant</hi> conſigned unto them, and Chriſt neither by himſelf, nor by his Apoſtles did forbid the Church to ſatisfie and fulfil this their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Or laſt of all, If Chriſt hath only appointed Baptiſm inſtead of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but ſaid nothing to determine the Subject of it, then it muſt needs follow, that <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> muſt at leaſt be lawful, and allowable, becauſe it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and not a forbidden, or ſinful thing. But upon this ſuppoſition, that it were left undetermined, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent by Chriſt, it might like other indifferent things be lawfully appointed by any Church, from which it would be a Sin to ſeparate upon that account. For in this caſe, Churches might ſafely differ in their practice about <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi>
                              <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:539"/> as they do now in the Ceremonies of Baptiſm; and thoſe who lived in a Church which did practice it, ought no more to ſeparate from her for appointing of it, then thoſe who lived in another Church, which did not practiſe it, ought to ſeparate from her, for not appointing thereof.</p>
                           <p>Thus much I have ſaid, I hope with ſufficient modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon ſuppoſition, that all I have written upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Queſtions, doth but ſatisfactorily prove, that <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> is only lawful, and not highly requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but then if it be not only lawful, but highly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary, ſo that it ought to be appointed, then it muſt needs be much more ſinful to ſeparate from a Church, which appointeth <hi>Infants</hi> to be Baptized.</p>
                           <p>Now, as to the requiſite neceſſity of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that my Reader bears in memory, that I have ſaid upon the laſt Queſtion, (to make it appear with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of credibility, that Chriſt inſtituted Baptiſm for Infants, as well as grown Perſons, and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their Companions Practiſed <hi>Infant-Baptiſm)</hi> I muſt here entreat him further to obſerve, that there is a two-fold neceſſity in matters of <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, one which proceeds from plain dictates of natural reaſon, or from plain and <hi>expreſs words of the Goſpel,</hi> where the ſenſe is ſo obvious and clear, that no ſober man can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, or doubt of it, and another which proceeds from <hi>the general Scope and Tenour of the Goſpel, or from doubtful places in it ſo, or ſo underſtood and interpreted by the unanimous voice, and practice of the ancient</hi> Catholick Church.</p>
                           <p>The firſt degree of neceſſity is founded on oftenſive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and demonſtration, wherein there is no room left for Objection.</p>
                           <p>And the Second is founded upon violent preſumption, where the Objections on one hand are inſufficient to move, or at leaſt to turn the Ballance, if put in the Scale againſt the other, which is weighed down <hi>[Mole univerſatis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae]</hi> with the authority of the Univerſal Church. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Rule, like others, is not ſo intelligible without an Example, I will add ſome <hi>Inſtances</hi> of things, which are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52190:539"/> neceſſary to be believed, and practiſed by every good Chriſtian under both theſe Notions of neceſſity, that they may be better underſtood.</p>
                           <p>According to the Firſt Notion of it, it is neceſſary to believe, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the</hi> Meſſias, <hi>and the Son of God,</hi> becauſe it is delivered in expreſs words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                           <p>And according to the Second Notion of it, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to believe, that <hi>he is of the ſame ſubſtance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and equal unto him,</hi> and that there <hi>are three diſtinct, and coequal Perſons in the God-head, which are all but one God,</hi> becauſe theſe Doctrines, though they are not to be found in expreſs words in the Goſpel, yet they are to be collected from ſeveral places of it, which were always ſo interpreted by that ancient Catholick Church.</p>
                           <p>Again, according to the Firſt Notion of neceſſity, it is neceſſary for all Men to believe the Word of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoken or written, becauſe natural reaſon teacheth us ſo to do.</p>
                           <p>And according to the Second Notion of it, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to believe the Books contained in the New Teſtament, to be the Word of God, and no other (how Divine, and Orthodox, and Ancient ſoever they may be) becauſe they, and they only have been received for ſuch by the ancient Catholick Church.</p>
                           <p>In like manner as to matter of Practice, by the Firſt ſort of Neceſſity, it is neceſſary for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to aſſemble together to Worſhip God, becauſe Reaſon, and Scripture plainly teach them ſo to do.</p>

                           <p>But then, as thoſe Texts in Conjunction with Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do put thoſe Doctrines out of all reaſonable doubt: So do the other, which I have cited in Conjunction with the Practice of the Ancient Church, put the requiſite neceſſity of Infant-Baptiſm out of Queſtion, becauſe the Church in the next Age unto the Apoſtles, practiced Infant-Baptiſm, as an Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by conſequence, as an Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>In like manner, as the Intrinſecal Arguments taken from the Style, Sanctity, Dignity, and Efficacy of the Holy Scriptures, and the perpetual Analogy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the ſeveral Books contained in them, are by themſelves but probable, and no demonſtrative reaſons, that all the Books contained in the Canon, and no other, are the Word of God, but in conjunction with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and Authority of the Ancient Catholick Church, amount to a Demonſtration: So, though the Texts which I have cited, are of themſelves but probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the requiſite neceſſity of Infant-Baptiſm, yet in concurrence with ſuch a Comment upon them, as the Practice of the next Age unto the Apoſtles, and all Ages ſince, from one Generation to another, they amount to ſuch a demonſtration, as is called in <hi>Logick, Demonſtratio ducens ad abſurdum,</hi> and are a violent Preſumption, that Children ought to be Baptized.

                           <p>Let us ſuppoſe, for Example, That the Diſciples of Chriſt, inſtead of rebuking thoſe, that brought little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                           <p>The caſe, which I ſuppoſe one way, is the real caſe the other, only with this difference, that the ſuppoſed caſe would have but the benefit of one Text, whereas the real hath the benefit of many in Conjunction with Tradition; and therefore, ſeeing there are ſo many Texts, and ſuch a cloud of Witneſſes for Infant-Baptiſm, Why ſhould it not be looked upon as one of the common Notions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, like the <hi>Parallel Doctrines</hi> above-mentioned, though it be not commanded (eſpecially when, as I have ſhewed there was no need of commanding of it) in expreſs Words.</p>

                           <p>This is ſo true, that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> themſelves cannot defend the Baptizing of ſuch grown Perſons, as were born, and bred in the Church merely from the Scriptures, in which the very Inſtitution of Baptiſm hath a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto Proſelytes, who from <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>To ſtate this Queſtion aright, I muſt proceed in the ſame order, that I did upon the laſt.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, In arguing from the bare lawfulneſs, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
                           <p>And Secondly, From the neceſſity thereof.</p>
                           <p>As to the lawfulneſs of it, I have already ſhewn upon the laſt Queſtion, That there is no neceſſity of having a Command, or Example for to juſtifie the practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Initiation; but it is ſufficient, that it is not forbidden to make it lawful, and allowable under the Goſpel. Nay, I have ſhewed upon the Second Queſtion, that of the two, there is more reaſon that Chriſtians ſhould have had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command to leave off, or lay down the practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Initiation, becauſe it was commanded by God in Infant-Circumciſion, and approved by him in Infant-Baptiſm (which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church added to Infant-Circumciſion) under the Legal State. Commands are uſually given for the beginning of the practice of ſomething, which was never in practice before; but to juſtifie the continuation of an anciently inſtituted, or anciently received practice, it is ſufficient, that the Power, which inſtituted, or approved it, do not countermand, or forbid it: and this, as I have ſhewn, being the caſe of Infants-Initiation, the Initiation of them by Baptiſm under the Goſpel, muſt at leaſt be lawful and allowable, and if it be ſo, then Parents, and Pro-parents are bound in Conſcience to bring them unto Baptiſm in Obedience unto the Orders of the Church. For the Church is a Society of a People in Covenant with God, and in this Society, as in all others there are Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and in Inferiors, ſome that muſt Order, and ſome that muſt obſerve Orders, ſome that muſt Command, and ſome that muſt Obey; and therefore, if the Catholick Church, or any Member of it commands her Children to obſerve
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52190:544"/> any lawful thing, they are bound by the Common-Laws of all Government, and by the Precepts in the Goſpel, which regard Eccleſiaſtical Order and Diſcipline, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her Commands. <hi>Obey them</hi> (ſaith the <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</note> Apoſtle) <hi>who have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves unto them, for they watch for your Souls</hi> Accordingly we read that St. <note n="†" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4.</note> 
                              <hi>Paul,</hi> as he went through the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities delivered the Chriſtians the Decrees, which the Apoſtles had made at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to keep; but I think, I need not ſpend more time in the Proof of a thing, which all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will grant me, for though they differ from us, as to the Subject of pure Eccleſiaſtical Power, yet they all agree, that there is ſuch a Power, and that all lawful Commands proceeding from it, ought to be Obey'd.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, if Infants are not uncapable of Baptiſmal Initiation, as is proved under the firſt Queſtion, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it by Chriſt, as is proved under the Second; but on the contrary, there are very good Reaſons to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that Chriſt at leaſt allowed them the benefit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Baptiſm, as well as grown Perſons: then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of any Church to Baptize them muſt needs lay an Obligation of Obedience upon the Conſciences of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Pro-parents, who live within the Pale of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter of that Ordinance is a thing not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but at leaſt, allowed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe People, when the are once ſatisfied with the lawfulneſs, are wont, eſpecially in Church-matters, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the expediency of their Superiors Commands, and to obey them with moſt Chearfulneſs, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they know they have good reaſons for what they ordain; therefore, leaſt any one whom perhaps I may have convinced of the bare lawfulneſs of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſhould doubt of the expediency of it, and upon that account be leſs ready to comply, I will here proceed to juſtifie the practice of the Church in this Particular; by ſhewing</p>
                           <p>Firſt, That Baptiſmal-Initiation is very beneficial and profitable for Infants.</p>
                           <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52190:545"/>
                           <p>And Secondly, That the Baptizing of them condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth very much to the well-being and edification of the Church.</p>
                           <p>Firſt then, Baptiſmal-Initiation is very beneficial and profitable for Infants, becauſe they are capable of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and Priviledges of Baptiſm.</p>
                           <p>This I ſhewed in general before, under the firſt Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and now I will ſhew it in a more particular manner of Induction, by inſiſting upon the ſeveral Ends, for which Baptiſm was ordained.</p>
                           <p>Firſt then Baptiſm was ordained, That the Baptized Perſon might be thereby ſolemnly conſecrated unto God, and dedicated to his Service, and I hope I need not prove, that Children are capable of this benefit; ſince <hi>Jewiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> were Conſecrated to God by Circumciſion; and the Scripture tells us, that <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Judges</hi> 13. 15.</note> 
                              <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a <hi>Nazarite</hi> from the Womb, and that <hi>Samuel</hi> from the time of his Weaning, was dedicated unto the Lord.</p>
                           <p>Secondly Baptiſm was ordained, That the Baptized Perſon might be made a Member of Chriſt's Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is the Holy Catholick Church. This is a great, and honourable Priviledge, and no Man can deny, but <hi>Infants</hi> are as capable of it under the New, as they were under the Old Teſtament. Nay, ſo far are they from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under any Natural Incapacity, as to Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that they are ordinarily born free of Kingdoms, Cities, and Companies; and therefore, why any Man ſhould think it not ſo proper for the Church-Chriſtian to be as indulgent to them, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was, and Civil Societies uſually are, I profeſs I cannot tell.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly it was ordained, That the Baptized Perſon might by that Solemnity paſs from a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein he was a Child of Wrath, into a State of Adoption or Grace, wherein he becomes a Child of God.</p>
                           <p>For by our Firſt Birth we are all Children of Wrath.</p>
                           <p>But by our Second Birth in Baptiſm, we are made Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: And why it ſhould be ſo improper for a Child to paſs in this ſolemn manner from one Spiritual, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52190:545"/> well, as from one Temporal State to another, or be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Adopted by God, as well as Man, or</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Why a Child may not be Adopted under the Goſpel, as well, as under the Law? I am confident, thoſe who are willing to defer the Baptiſm of Infants, would be puzzled to give any rational account.</p>
                           <p>In the Fourth place, Baptiſm was inſtituted for a Sign to Seal unto Baptized Perſons the pardon of their Sins, and to confer upon them a Right of Inheritance unto Everlaſting Life; but Baptiſm hath this Effect upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as well as upon adult Perſons, for it waſhes them clean from <note n="*" place="margin">De hoc etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                           <p>But in the Fifth place, Baptiſm was ordained, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the Covenant, and ingrafted into Chriſt's

                           <p>Wherefore, though it ſhould be granted, that the Holy Ghoſt cannot be actually conferred upon Infants in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by reaſon of their natural incapacity (as <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> raſhly aſſert) yet the Baptizing of them is not fruſtrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to this great End of Baptiſm, becauſe they thereby acquire an actual Antecedent Right to the Aſſiſtances, and Illuminations of the Holy Spirit, which they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as ſoon, and as faſt, as their natural incapacity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves.</p>
                           <p>This diſtinction betwixt having the Spirit, and having a Right unto the Spirit, holds not only in Infant-Baptiſm, but in the Baptiſm of Hypocrites, and ſecret Sinners, who by ſubmitting unto the Ordinances of Baptiſm acquire an actual Antecedent Right unto the Spirit, although they are in a moral incapacity of receiving the Graces of it, till their Hypocriſie is removed. Nevertheleſs, their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not ineffectual as to this End, but is a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Holy Ghoſt upon them without re-baptization, becauſe though they cannot receive it at the moment of their Baptiſm, by reaſon of their Hypocriſie, as ſincere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents do, in whom there is no ſuch Moral Impediment; yet by virtue of it, they will be ſure to receive it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as ſoon, as they ſhall in any degree become capable thereof.</p>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:52190:546"/>
                           <p>Thoſe are the Bleſſings, and Benefits, conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Baptiſm by God's appointment, of which Infants are as capable, as actual Believers, and let any Impartial Man judge, Whether it is more for their benefit, that this manifold capacity in them ſhould be actually anſwered by the timely Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, or that it ſhould lay void and unſatisfied, till they came to years of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion? Which is beſt for a Child that hath the <hi>Evil,</hi> to be Touched for it, while he is a Child, or to wait till he is of ſufficient Age to be ſenſible of the Benefit? Or to make one Compariſon more, which would be beſt for a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Child, to be preſently reſtored to his Blood, and and Eſtate, and his Princes Favour, or to be kept in a meer capacity of being reſtored till he was a Man?</p>
                           <p>But beſides theſe Benefits which are conſequent upon Baptiſm by God's appointment, there is another no leſs profitable to young Children, which will juſtifie the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Infant-Initiation,</hi> and that is to have ſuch an early pre-engagement laid upon them, which without the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Baſeneſs can Ingratitude, they cannot afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. No Perſon of common Ingenuity, who hath any ſence of honour, or any tolerable degree of Conſcience within him, can without ſhame and horrour break thoſe Sacred Bonds aſunder, by which he was bound to God, in his Infancy, when he comes to Years of underſtanding; but on the contrary, will think himſelf in Honour, and Gratitude, bound to own, and ſtand to the Obligation, which he then contracted, when he was graciouſly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſo many Bleſſings and Privileges, before he could do any thing himſelf towards the obtaining of them, or underſtand his own good. It would argue a Perſon to be of a very ill nature, and untoward Diſpoſition to break ſuch ſolemn Foederal Vows, and therefore, we ſee that Children generally do readily take upon themſelves their Baptiſmal Obligations, when they come to the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereas were they left alone, to their own Freedom, when they would be Baptized, they would be apt to put it off from time to time, through the averſneſs that the corrupt nature of Man hath to ſuch ſtrict, and Spiritual
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52190:547"/> Engagements, and in ſuch a State of Liberty, as this, Men would need, as many, and as earneſt Exhortations unto Baptiſm, as unto the Lord's Supper; and in ſuch an Age, as ours is at leaſt, reluct as much to come unto that, as we ſee by experience they do unto this. Wherefore, upon Suppoſition that Chriſt doth but allow Children to be brought unto him in Baptiſm, The Wiſdom of the Church is highly to be applauded for bringing them under ſuch an early, and beneficial pre-engagement, and not leaving them to their own liberty at ſuch years, when Fleſh, and Blood, would be apt to find out ſo many Shifts, and Excuſes, and make them regret to be Baptized.</p>
                           <p>And therefore in the Second place, as the Baptiſm of Infants is very Beneficial, and profitable unto them: So it conduceth very much to the well-being, and edification of the Church, in preventing thoſe Scandalous and Shameful delays of Baptiſm, which grown Perſons otherwiſe would be apt to make, putting of it off till the time of ſome great ſickneſs, as many were wont to do in the third and fourth Century, when being not Baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, they did ordinarily receive Baptiſm, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> now receive extream <hi>Unction,</hi> when they were ready to expire.</p>
                           <p>For, as it is uſual now for Perſons to defer the receiving of the Lord's Supper, for fear of Damnation, miſtaking the Apoſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>He that Eateth and Drinketh unworthily, Eateth, and Drinketh Damnation to himſelf:</hi> So in thoſe Ages it was uſual for Perſons to defer their own, and their Childrens Baptiſm out of a <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p>Now the Baptizing of Children being deferred by their Parents out of this Superſtitious fear, they, when they came to be Men and Women, put the doing of it off for ſeveral Reaſons, and Pretences, which we learn out of the Writers of thoſe times.</p>
                           <p>Some deferred it out of Worldly Love, and a Carnal loathneſs to renounce their ſinful Pleaſures, and take upon them the Yoke of Chriſt.

                           <p>Thus much upon enquiry into the lawfulneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of Infant-Baptiſm, to ſhew Chriſtian Parents what an indiſpenſable Obligation lies upon their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to bring their Children to be Baptized in Obedience to the Church, which hath appointed Infant-Baptiſm; but then if Infant-Baptiſm be not only neceſſary becauſe

                           <p>Firſt, As being moſt agreeable to the practice of the Apoſtles, who it is highly to be preſumed, authorized the practice of Infant-Baptiſm, becauſe, it was practiſed in the next Age unto them.</p>
                           <p>And Secondly, As being moſt agreeable to the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Will of Chriſt, who it is to be preſumed would have forbidden, and countermanded the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> practice of initiating Infants, if he had not had a mind they ſhould be Baptized.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore <note n="*" place="margin">Nam quum paedo-Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiâ Judaicâ in admiſſione Proſelytorum ita fuit notus, uſitatus, &amp; frequens, ut nihil ferè notius, uſitatius, &amp; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentius, non opus erat, ut aliquo praecepto roboraretur.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52190:548"/> long after he departed, and we find the practice of it in the one, harmoniouſly anſwering to the practice of it in the other; and therefore what was before, and what was after this time, we may well preſume, was continued in the interim during the time of the Apoſtles, as his preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Will and Intention, who never did, or ſpoke any thing, that can reaſonably be interpreted, that he would have the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtom of admitting <hi>Infants</hi> into the Church, laid aſide; and therefore, his ſilence, and the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Scriptures, are ſo far from being Arguments againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> that conſidering the Antecedent uſage of it, they are very ſtrong Preſumptions for it, as the Learned Author in the Margin foregoing doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently prove.</p>
                           <p>To this purpoſe alſo, have I diſcourſed above, upon the Second and Third Queſtions; and therefore if Chriſt in the Reformation of the Church, from the Law into the Goſpel, did not repeal the Ancient practice of <hi>Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> but left <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to be adminiſtred in the ſame Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as before his time, then it muſt needs be concluded, that there lies the ſame Obligation upon Parents (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from the Commands of the Church) to deſire Baptiſm for their Children, as for grown Proſelytes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it for themſelves.</p>
                           <p>For what authority ſoever enacts any thing concerning Children, or Perſons under the years of diſcretion, doth lay at leaſt an implicite Obligation upon Parents, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents to ſee that act be performed. As if for Example, an Act of Parliament ſhould be made, that all Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, Men, Women, and Children, ſhould pay ſo much an Head unto the King, the Act, by the nature of it, would oblige Parents, and Pro-parents, to pay for their Children, and the Minors in their cuſtody, as well as for themſelves. Or, if in the time of a general Contagion, the Supream Power ſhould command, that all Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, ſhould every Morning take ſuch an Antidote, that Command would oblige Parents to give it unto their Children, as well, as to take it themſelves. Juſt ſo the Ordinance of Baptiſm being intended, or inſtituted
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52190:549"/> by our Saviour in its ancient Latitude for Children, as well, as grown Perſons, it muſt needs lay an Obligation upon Parents, and Pro-parents to bring them to the Holy Sacrrament, otherwiſe the Divine Inſtitution would in part be made void, and fruſtrated of the Ends for which it was inſtituted, as if it did not alſo lay an Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Adult Perſons to offer themſelves unto the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would be of no force at all.</p>
                           <p>To ſum up all in ſhort. When our Lord firſt appointed Baptiſm, and afterwards ſaid, <hi>Go, and Proſelyte all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. either he intended that Children ſhould be Baptized, as well as Grown Proſelytes, or he did not; if he did not intend they ſhould be Baptized, Why did he not plainly diſcover that Intention? Nay, Why did he not plainly forbid them to be Baptized, as they were wont to be, but if he intended they ſhould be Baptized according to the ancient cuſtom in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, Parents are as much bound to offer them unto Baptiſm, as Adult Believers, Men and Women, are bound to offer themſelves.</p>
                           <p>What I have here ſaid about the Obligation, which lies upon Parents to bring their Children unto Baptiſm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all <hi>Pro-parents</hi> to whoſe care Children are committed, as <hi>Guardians, Tutors,</hi> and <hi>Church-Wardens;</hi> and leſt any ſhould ask, as ſome Sceptically do, at <hi>What time they are bound to bring them unto Baptiſm?</hi> As <hi>ſoon, as they are born, or the next day after, or when?</hi> I anſwer, by ſhewing the impertinency of that Queſtion, in reference to Grown Believers thus: <hi>When muſt a Believing Man, or Woman be Baptized? As ſoon as he Believes, or the next day after, or when?</hi> And truly the Anſwer is the ſame to both Queſtions, <hi>at any time,</hi> the Goſpel indulging a diſcretional Latitude in both Caſes, and only forbidding the wilful neglect of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and all unreaſonable, and needleſs delays thereof.</p>

                           <p>The ſtating of this, depends upon what I have ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Second, and Third Queſtions, to prove, <hi>That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are capable Subjects of Baptiſm, and that it is lawful to</hi>

                           <p>Accordingly, it never entred into the Heart of any of the ancient Chriſtians to refuſe Communion with grown Believers, who had been Baptized in their Infancy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Baptized in perfect health, as Children moſt commonly were, or only in dnager of Death, as the Children of thoſe Novatian kind of Parents above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned always were, who were ſo far from thinking <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> a Nullity, or Corruption of Baptiſm, that they thought it neceſſary for them in caſe of apparent danger, and durſt not let them die un baptized.</p>

                           <p>Theſe were all the Pleas we read of for deferring the Baptiſm of Infants among the Ancients, who never urged this for one, that Infant-Baptiſm was unlawful, or invalid. No, They never argued againſt it from the want of thoſe pre-requiſite Conditions in Children, which Chriſt, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52190:550"/> the Apoſtles required in Adult Proſelytes, nor from the want of Precept, and Example for it in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſo underſtood the Scriptures, as to think it as lawful, and warrantable as the Baptiſm of grown Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and neceſſary in caſe of danger; and juſt ſo did thoſe, who deferred their Baptiſm, for fear of ſinning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, think the Baptiſm of Men and Women only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at the laſt extremity, in apparent danger of Death.</p>
                           <p>But then if the ordinary practice of Infant-Baptiſm be not only lawful, and valid, but alſo neceſſary, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt agreeable to the preſumed Will of Chriſt, who did not countermand the practice of it, and moſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the practice of the Apoſtles, as can be proved from the practice of the very next Age unto them; then it muſt not only be lawful to Communicate with Believers, who were Baptized in their Infancy, but an exceeding great Sin, and Preſumption to refuſe Communion with them upon that account.</p>
                           <p>In a word, If <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> be not only lawful, but neceſſary, what a grievous, and provoking Sin, muſt it needs be, to diſown thoſe for Members of Chriſt's Body, whom he owns to be ſuch? But if it be neither, as <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> vainly pretend, then there hath not been a true Church upon the Face of the Earth, for Eleven hundred Years, nor a Church, for above Fifteen hundred, with which a true Chriſtian could Communicate without Sin.</p>

                           <p>ALthough in the management of this Controverſie againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> I have endeavoured ſo to ſtate the Caſe of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> as to obviate, or anſwer all the Conſiderable Pleas, and Material Objections, which they are wont to make againſt it; yet there are two of their Objections, of which I have yet taken no notice, thinking it better, that I might avoid te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, and confuſion in determining upon the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Queſtions, to Propoſe, and Anſwer them a part by themſelves.</p>
                           <p>The Firſt of theſe two, is the ancient Cuſtom of <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Communion unto Infants,</hi> which they endeavour with all their Art, and Skill to run Parallel with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> although there is not the like Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor the like Reaſon for the practice of that, as there is for the practice of this.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52190:551"/> it ſelf. But on the contrary, the Holy Euchariſt, or Communion, is the <hi>Sacrament of Perfection,</hi> and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Chriſtian Religion, being primarily, and chiefly inſtituted for a Sacrificial Feaſt in remembrance of Chriſt's Death, and Paſſion, which being an act of great Knowledge and Piety, Children are not capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
                           <p>But Secondly, There is not the like Reaſon for Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and Communicating Infants, becauſe that is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Authority of many Texts of Scripture, which without the Concurrence of Tradition are fairly, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuinely interpretable for it; but this is grounded only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Text <hi>[John</hi> 6. 53. <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood ye have no life in you]</hi> which it is doubtful whether it is to be underſtood of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, or no, becauſe it cannot be underſtood of it but in a <hi>proleptical ſence,</hi> the Lord's Supper having not been yet inſtituted by him; or if it be to be ſo underſtood, yet the ſence of it ought to be regulated by the Chief end of its <hi>Inſtitution</hi> contained in thoſe words of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and this do ye, <hi>as oft, as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</hi> Wherefore though this Text were literally to be underſtood of the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> firſt interprets it, yet it ought not to be ſtrained to <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> becauſe Infants cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Holy Banquet in <hi>remembrance of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore though the Cuſtom of <hi>Communicating Infants</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed by Degrees in ſome Ages of the Church, yet the Weſtern Churches diſcerning the miſtake upon which it was grounded, have long ſince laid it aſide, though they ſtill continue the practice of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> as fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Chief end of Baptiſm, and as being founded upon more, and clearer Texts of Scriptures, and a much more noble Tradition, than <hi>Infant-Communion</hi> is.</p>
                           <p>But Thirdly, There is not the like reaſon for Baptizing, and Communicating Infants, becauſe the Correſpondent practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in <hi>Infant-Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> anſwered as a Pattern unto that under the Law, but there was nothing of a Pattern under it, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52190:552"/> anſwered ſo to <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> becauſe a Child never partook of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 26, 27.</note> Paſsover, before he was old enough to take his Father by the hand, and to go up from the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto the Mount of the Temple, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire about the meaning of the Service, and was capable of underſtanding the nature of it, as it was done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And in like manner when the Children of Chriſtians are old enough to be inſtructed in the nature of the Holy Communion, and to underſtand that, then they may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, be it as ſoon, as it will, if they are Baptized and Confirmed; though it is true, that Chriſtian Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are uſually much older, than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> were, before they Communicate, which is merely accidental, becauſe it requires a riper reaſon to underſtand the Myſtery of the Holy Euchariſt, which is done in remembrance of our Spiritual Deliverance by the Sacrifice of Chriſt, both God and Man, upon the Croſs, than to underſtand the plain and eaſie meaning of the Paſsover, which was annually kept in remembrance of the Temporal Deliverance of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But to ſpeak yet more fully of <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> the practice of it is ſo far from prejudicing the Cauſe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,</hi> that it mightily confirms it, becauſe none were, or could be admitted to partake of the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, till they were validly <note n="*" place="margin">Theodoret. Therapeut. Serm. 2. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                              </note> ſtill is practiſed, were of Opinion that the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants</hi> was as lawful, and valid, as that of profeſſing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers can be.</p>
                           <p>As for the Original of this cuſtom, it is not known when it began, probably it came in by degrees from the ancient, and laudable cuſtom of adminiſtring the Lord's Supper to grown Perſons preſently after their Baptiſm; and if ſo many of the ancient Churches were ſo tender towards <hi>Infants,</hi> as to bring them to the <hi>Communion,</hi> rather than deprive them of the leaſt ſhadow of right, what ſhall be ſaid in excuſe of thoſe uncharitable Men, who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52190:552"/> will rather deſtroy all the Churches in the World, than bring their Children unto Baptiſm, of which they are capable, and to which they have a Right ſo highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not certain, and infallible, as I have proved above?</p>
                           <p>The Second Objection againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> which I took no notice of, but reſerved for this place, is taken <hi>from their incapacity to engage themſelves in Covenant unto God.</hi> For, ſay theſe Men, all who enter into <hi>Covenant,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Seal of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> muſt contract, and ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for their parts, as well as God doth for his, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Baptiſm which ſaveth us, muſt</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. 21.</note> 
                              <hi>have the anſwer, or reſtipulation of a good Conſcience towards God.</hi> But how can <hi>Infants</hi> reſtipulate, or what <hi>Conſcience</hi> can be in them, who have not the uſe of reaſon, nor are capable of knowing what the <hi>Covenant</hi> means?</p>
                           <p>To this Objection, I anſwer as formerly, That it is as ſtrong againſt <hi>Infant-Circumciſion,</hi> as <hi>Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> for the <hi>Infants</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> were admitted as effectually into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and had it as really ſealed unto them, and were as ſtrongly tyed to perform the <hi>Conditions</hi> of it, when they came to years of <hi>underſtanding,</hi> as if they had been Circumciſed then, and at their Circumciſion had perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and expreſly <hi>indented</hi> with God.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore the ſame anſwer which will ſerve to juſtifie <hi>Infant-Circumciſion</hi> will juſtifie <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the place of it, and it is this: That God of his goodneſs towards <hi>Infant's</hi> was pleaſed to ſeal the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace unto <hi>Infants</hi> upon an <hi>implicite,</hi> and <hi>imputative</hi> ſort of Stipulation, which at years of underſtanding they were bound to own by openly profeſſing the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> or if they then renounced it, thereupon they became Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which in ſuch caſes was as void, as if it had never been made. An implicit Stipulation was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Children of Believers, though an open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Stipulation was required of Grown Proſelytes, which ſhews, that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was an inſtitution of <hi>Latitude,</hi> and that perſonal, and expreſs Reſtipulation was not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pre-requiſite condition to Circumciſion, but only to ſome Perſons to be Circumciſed.</p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:52190:553"/>
                           <p>In like manner Baptiſm being an <hi>inſtitution of Latitude,</hi> ordained for Perſons under, as well as at the years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, perſſonal and expreſs Stipulation is only required of the former; and therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Text above cited likely had reſpect not to all Baptiſm, or Baptiſm in general, but only to the Baptiſm of Adult Proſelytes, whom the Miniſter uſed to <note n="*" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Hence</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian de Baptiſmo <hi>calls Baptiſm</hi> Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem Salutis. <hi>And in St.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian <hi>we often read of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation in Baptiſm.</hi>
                              </note> interrogate at the time of Baptiſm, much after the ſame manner, as we interrogate Adult Proſelytes now.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, this Objection like the reſt which the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> make, runs upon this preſumption, that Baptiſm is a ſtrict inſtitution, and that perſonal and expreſs anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Reſtipulation is a pre-requiſite <hi>condition</hi> to all Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, whereas it is only a perſonal qualification required of Majors, or Adult Perſons, when they come to be Baptized.</p>
                           <p>But as for Children, Baptiſm may be adminiſtred unto them upon an implicite, and imputative ſort of Reſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as Circumciſion was to the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and Baptiſm now is to <hi>agonizing Chriſtian Infants,</hi> or elſe it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto them as Baptiſm formerly was among the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Minors</hi> of Proſelytes upon a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious</hi> Reſtipulation by their <hi>Sponſors,</hi> which ſeems to have been tranſlated together with the uſe of Baptiſm from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. It is certain, that <note n="*" place="margin">De Baptiſmo cap. 18. quid enim neceſſe eſt Sponſores etiam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo ingeri?</note> 
                              <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes mention of <hi>Sponſors,</hi> or Sureties for Children at Baptiſm, and very probable, that the Apoſtles made <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Major domos</hi> ſtipulate in the name of their <note n="†" place="margin">Praefecturae igitur juridicae quae Baptiſmo praeerat profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebatur Proſelytus ipſe Majorennis (Maſculus qui annum decimum tertium, foemina quae duodecim ſuperaverat) legem Moſaicam ſe ſervaturum.

Selden de Synedriis, Lib. 1. c. 3. <hi>And what is here ſaid of the CONSISTORT among the</hi> Jews, <hi>concerning the Baptiſm of Infants, and Minors, St.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſaith of the</hi> Church <hi>among Chriſtians,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodat illis mater Eccleſia aliorum pedes ut veniant, aliorum cor, ut credant, aliorum linguam ut fateantur.</note> 
                              <hi>Minors,</hi> when they Baptized them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to do; and upon this Suppoſition St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Text above cited, might alſo probably allude to all Baptiſm, becauſe Grown
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52190:553"/> Proſelytes to the <hi>Chriſtan Religion</hi> did anſwer for their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> as well as for themſelves at Baptiſm, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>Nay, there is little reaſon to doubt, but that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> being the Pattern of the <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm,</hi> the Apoſtles, and their Aſſiſtants who were <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Cuſtom of <hi>Vicarious Stipulation</hi> at the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Minors,</hi> as well as all the other Particulars, in which they reſemble one another, as the Picture doth the Face, whoſe Picture it is.</p>
                           <p>As for Example, the <hi>Jewiſh Baptiſm</hi> was adminiſtred to Women, as well as Men, and ſo is the Chriſtian.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, It was never reiterated nor repeated, no more is the Chriſtian.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, It was called Regeneration, and a New Birth, and Baptized Perſons were ſaid to be born again and Regenerated, which alſo holds in Chriſtian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, Baptized Proſelytes among the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to leave their neareſt Relations, if it were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and adhere to the Church, and ſo are Baptized Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Proſelytes bound to do the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, The Infants of Proſelytes were Baptized among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as the Proſelytes themſelves, and ſo have I proved, that Infants have been always Baptized among the Chriſtians.</p>
                           <p>And therefore in the laſt place, ſince the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church Baptized Infants upon <hi>Vicarious Stipulation,</hi> why ſhould not we think it ſufficient for their entrance into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that the Apoſtles did ſo too?</p>
                           <p>Theſe things, and whatſoever elſe is written in this little Tract, I hope will be fairly, and candidly confidered by the Diſſenters among us upon the account of <hi>Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> I ſay, the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my <hi>Conſcience</hi> alſo bearing me Witneſs in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who is the Searcher of Hearts, that I have great heavineſs, and almoſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52190:554"/> continual ſorrow in my heart for them, and that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to the Church. I could wiſh in the Apoſtles Sence, that I my ſelf were an <hi>Anathema</hi> from Chriſt. And becauſe it is a Diſeaſe too common among Diſſenters, and more eſpecially among thoſe, with whom I have been a dealing, to have minds full of Prejudice, Prepoſſeſſion, and ſiniſter Suſpitions againſt what we Speak, or Preach, or Write, I have here ſubjoined a Letter of that Famous Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt Mr. <hi>John Philpot,</hi> concerning <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,</hi> which I ſeriouſly recommend to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and diligent peruſal, hoping that the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may perhaps have leſs effect upon them as they come from me, may be better received, and make deeper impreſſion upon their Souls as they come from him, who like the Primitive Martyrs, was Bleſſed with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Viſions, and chearfully ſuffered for his Redeemer, who had ſuffered for him, and thanked God when the time was come, that he was to ſeal the truth of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion</hi> with his Blood.</p>

                           <p>I received Yeſternight from you, (Dear Brother <hi>S.</hi> and Fellow-Priſoner for the truth for Chriſt's Goſpel) a Letter, wherein you gently require my Judgment, concerning the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants,</hi> which is the effect thereof. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do ſhew you what I have learned out of God's Word, and of his true Infallible Church, touching the ſame, I think it not out of the matter, firſt to declare what Viſion I had the ſame Night whilſt muſing on your Letter I fell aſleep, knowing that God doth not without cauſe reveal to his People who have their Minds fixed on him, Special and Spiritual Revelations to their Comfort, as a taſte of their Joy and Kingdom to come, which Fleſh and Blood cannot comprehend.</p>
                           <p>Being in the midſt of my ſweet reſt, it ſeemed to me to ſee a great beautiful City all of the colour of Azure, and white, four ſquare in a marvellous beautiful compoſition in the midſt of the Skie, the ſight whereof ſo inwardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me, that I am not able to expreſs the conſolation I had thereof, yea, the remembrance thereof cauſeth my Heart
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52190:555"/> as yet to leap for Joy: And as Charity is no Churle, but would have others to be Partakers of his delight, ſome thought I called to others (I cannot tell whom) and whilſt they came and we together beheld the ſame, by and by to my great Grief it vaded away.</p>
                           <p>This Dream I think not to have come of the illuſion of the Senſes, becauſe it brought with it ſo much Spiritual Joy, and I take it to be of the working of God's Spirit for the contentation of your Requeſt, as he wrought in <hi>Peter</hi> to ſatisfie <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Therefore I Interpret this Beautiful City to be the Glorious Church of Chriſt, and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it in the Sky, ſignifieth the Heavenly State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whoſe Converſation is in Heaven, and that according to the Primitive Church, which is now in Heaven, Men ought to meaſure and judge the Church of Chriſt now in Earth; for as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Foundations thereof be in the Holy Hills, and glorious things be ſpoken of the City of God</hi> And the marvellous quadrature of the ſame, I take to ſignifie the univerſal agreement in the ſame, and that all the Church here Militant ought to conſent to the Primitive Church throughout the four Parts of the World, as the Prophet affirmeth, ſaying; <hi>God maketh us to dwell after one manner in one Houſe.</hi> And that I conceived ſo wonderful Joy at the Contemplation thereof, I underſtand the unſpeakable Joy which they have that be at Unity with Chriſt's Primitive Church: For there is Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and Peace, which paſſeth all Underſtanding, as it is written in the Pſalms; <hi>As of Joyful Perſons is the dwelling of all them that be in thee.</hi> And that I called others to the fruition of this Viſion, and to behold this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful City, I conſtrue it by the Will of God this Viſion to have come upon me, muſing on your Letter, to the end, that under this Figure I might have occaſion to move you with many others, to behold the Primitive Church in all your Opinions concerning Faith, and to conform your ſelf in all points to the ſame, which is the Pillar and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of truth, and teacheth the true uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and having with a greater fulneſs than we have now, the firſt fruits of the Holy Ghoſt, did declare the true
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52190:555"/> Interpretation of the Scriptures according to all verity, even as our Saviour promiſed to ſend them another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, which ſhould teach them all truth.</p>
                           <p>And ſince all truth was taught and revealed to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, which is our Mother, let us all that be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children of God, ſubmit our ſelves to the judgment of the Church for the better underſtanding of the Articles of our Faith, and of the doubtful Sentences of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Let us not go about to ſhew in us, by following any private Man's Interpretation upon the Word, another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than they of the Primitive Church had, leſt we deceive our ſelves. For there is but one Faith and one Spirit, which is not contrary to himſelf, neither otherwiſe now teacheth us than he did them.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52190:556"/> of a Viſion before God unfeigned. But that you may not think that I go about to ſatisfie you with uncertain Viſions only, and not after God's Word, I will take the ground of your Letter, and ſpecially anſwer to the ſame by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and by infallible reaſons deduced out of the ſame, and prove the Baptiſm of Infants to be lawful, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and neceſſary, whereof you ſeem to ſtand in doubt.</p>
                           <p>Indeed if you look upon the Papiſtical Synagogue only, which hath corrupted God's Word by falſe Interpretations, and hath perverted the true uſe of Chriſt's Sacraments, you might ſeem to have good handfaſt of your Opinion againſt the Baptiſm of Infants. But foraſmuch as it is of more Antiquity, and hath his beginning from God's Word, and from the uſe of the Primitive Church, it muſt not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the abuſe in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church be neglected, or thought not expedient to be uſed in Chriſt's Church. <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> one of the <hi>Arrians</hi> Sect, with his Adherents, was one of the firſt that denied the Baptiſm of Children, and next after him <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Heretick, and ſome other there were in St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s time, as it doth appear by his Writings, and in our days the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and Inordinate kind of Men ſtirred up by the Devil, to the deſtruction of the Goſpel. But the Catholick truth delivered unto us by the Scriptures, plainly determineth, that all ſuch are to be Baptized, as whom God acknowledgeth for his People, and vouchſufeth them worthy of Sanctification or Remiſſion of their Sins. Therefore ſince that Infants be in the number or ſcroll of God's People, and be Partakers of the Promiſe by their Purification in Chriſt, it muſt needs follow thereby, that they ought to be Baptized as well as thoſe that can Profeſs their Faith. For we judge the People of God as well by the free and liberal Promiſe of God, as by the Confeſſion of Faith. For to whomſoever God promiſeth himſelf to be their God, and whom he acknowledgeth for his, thoſe no Man without great Impiety may exclude from the number of the Faithful. But God promiſeth, that he will not only be the God of ſuch as do profeſs him, but alſo of Infants, promiſing them his Grace and Remiſſion of Sins, as it appeareth by the words of the Covenant made unto
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52190:556"/> 
                              <hi>Abraham. I will ſet my Covenant between thee and me</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">

For Chriſt came to fulfil the Promiſes, and <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</note> not to diſſolve them. Therefore in the Goſpel he ſaith of <hi>Infants,</hi> that is, of ſuch as yet believed not; <hi>Let the little</hi>

                              <hi>that receiveth one ſuch little Child in my Name, receiveth me. Take heed therefore that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe Babes, for I tell you, their Angels do continually ſee in Heaven my Father's Face.</hi> And what may be ſaid more plainer than this; It is not the Will of the Heavenly Father, that the Infants ſhould periſh? Whereby we may gather that he receiveth them freely unto his Grace, although as yet they confeſs not their Faith. Since then that the Word of the Promiſe, which is contained in Baptiſm, pertaineth as well to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as Men, why ſhould the ſign of the Promiſe, which is Baptiſm in Water, be withdrawn from Children, when Chriſt himſelf commandeth them to be received of us, and promiſeth the Reward of a Prophet to thoſe that receive ſuch a little Infant, as he for an Example did put before his Diſciples.</p>
                           <p>Now will I prove with manifeſt Arguments, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note> ought to be Baptized, and that the Apoſtles of Chriſt did Baptize Children. The Lord commanded his Apoſtles to Baptize all Nations; therefore alſo Children ought to be Baptized, for they are comprehended under this Word, <hi>All Nations.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Further, whom God doth account among the faithful, they are faithful, for it was ſaid to <hi>Peter, That thing which</hi>

                              <hi>God hath purified, thou ſhalt not ſay to be common or unclean:</hi> But GOD doth repute Children among the Faithful: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they be faithful, except we had rather to reſiſt God, and ſeem ſtronger and wiſer than he.</p>
                           <pb n="88" facs="tcp:52190:557"/>
                           <p>And without all doubt the Apoſtles Baptized thoſe <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> which Chriſt commanded: But he commanded the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be Baptized, among the which Infants be reckoned: The Apoſtles then Baptized Infants.</p>
                           <p>The Goſpel is more than Baptiſm, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid; <hi>The</hi>

                              <hi>Lord ſent me to Preach the Goſpel, and not to Baptize:</hi> Not that he denied abſolutely that he was ſent to Baptize, but that he preferred Doctrine before Baptiſm, for the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both to the Apoſtles: but Children be received by the Doctrine of the Goſpel of God, and not refuſed: Therefore what Perſon being of reaſon may deny them Baptiſm, which is a thing leſſer than the Goſpel? For in the Sacraments be two things to be conſidered, the thing ſignified, and the Sign, and thing ſignified is greater than the Sign, and from the thing ſignified in Baptiſm, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not excluded; who therefore may deny them the Sign, which is Baptiſm in Water?</p>
                           <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> could not deny them to be Baptized in Water, to whom he ſaw the Holy Ghoſt given, which is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sign of God's People: For he ſaith in the <hi>Acts, May</hi>

                              <hi>any body forbid them to be Baptized in Water, who have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> denied not Baptiſm to Infants, for he knew certainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both by the Doctrine of Chriſt, and by the Covenant which is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Kingdom of Heaven pertained to Infants.</p>
                           <p>None be received into the Kingdom of Heaven, but <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> ſuch as God loveth, and which are endued with his Spirit: For whoſo hath not the Spirit of God, he is none of his. But Infants be beloved of God, and therefore want not the Spirit of God: Wherefore if they have the Spirit of God as well as Men, if they be numbred among the People of God as well as we that be of Age, who (I pray you) may well withſtand Children to be Baptized with Water, in the Name of the Lord.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtles in times paſt being yet not ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, did murmur againſt thoſe which brought their Children unto the Lord, but the Lord rebuked them, and ſaid; <hi>Let the Babes come unto me.</hi> Why then do not theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.</note> 
                              <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> obey the Commandments of the Lord?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52190:557"/> For what do they now a-days elſe that bring their Children to Baptiſm, than that they did in times paſt, which brought their Children to the Lord, and our Lord received them, and putting his hands on them, Bleſſed them, and both by Words and by Gentle Behaviour towards them, declared manifeſtly that Children be the People of God, and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of GOD? But ſome will ſay, Why then did not Chriſt Baptize them? Becauſe it is Written, Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Baptized not, but his Diſciples.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, Circumciſion in the Old Law was miniſtred <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>John</hi> 4.</note> to Infants; therefore Baptiſm ought to be miniſtred in the New Law unto Children. For Baptiſm is come in the ſtead of Circumciſion, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying to the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians;</hi> By <hi>Chriſt ye are Circumciſed with a Circumciſion which is</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                              <hi>without hands, when ye put off the body of ſin of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, being buried together with him through Baptiſm.</hi> Behold, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Baptiſm the Circumciſion of a Chriſtian Man, which is done without hands, not that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be miniſtred without hands, but that with hands no Man any longer ought to be Circumciſed, albeit the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Circumciſion do ſtill remain in Faithful People.</p>
                           <p>To this I may add, That the Servants of God were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to miniſter the Sacraments to them, for whom they were inſtituted. As for an Example, we may behold <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who moſt diligently procured the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Joſ.</hi> 2.</note> be Circumciſed before they entred into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but ſince the Apoſtles were the Preachers of the Word, and the very Faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, who may hereafter doubt that they Baptized Infants, ſince Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is in place of Circumciſion?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Item,</hi> The Apoſtles did attemperate all their doings to the Shadows and Figures of the Old Teſtament: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certain that they did attemperate Baptiſm accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to Circumciſion, and Baptized Children becauſe they were under the Figure of Baptiſm; for the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed through the Red Sea, and the bottom of the Water of <hi>Jordan,</hi> with their Children. And although the Children be not always expreſſed, neither the Women in the Holy Scriptures, yet they are comprehended and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the ſame.</p>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52190:558"/>
                           <p>Alſo the Scripture evidently telleth us, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles baptized whole Families or Houſholds: But the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be comprehended in a Family or Houſhold, as the chiefeſt and deareſt part thereof: Therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Apoſtles did Baptize Infants or Children, and not only Men of lawful age. And that the Houſe or Houſhold is taken for Man, Woman, and Child, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the 17. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and alſo in that <hi>Joſeph</hi> doth call <hi>Jacob</hi> with all his Houſe, to come out of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Finally, I can declare out of ancient Writers, that the Baptiſm of Infants hath continued from the Apoſtles time unto ours, neither that it was inſtituted by any Councels, neither of the Pope, nor of other Men, but commended from the Scripture by the Apoſtles themſelves. <hi>Origen</hi> upon the Declaration of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the 6. <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Church of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Baptiſm from the very Apoſtles.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> maketh mention of the Baptiſm of Infants, in the 3. Book againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and in his Epiſtle to <hi>Leta.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> for this purpoſe, a place out of <hi>John,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> in his 1. Book aganſt <hi>Julian,</hi> Chap. 2. and he again writing to St. <hi>Hierome</hi> Epiſt. 28. ſaith, <hi>That St.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian <hi>not making any new Decree, but firmly obſerving the Faith of the Church, judged with his fellow Biſhops, that as ſoon as one was born, he might be lawfully Baptized.</hi> The place of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is to be ſeen in his Epiſtle to <hi>Fidus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Alſo St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in writing againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in the 4. Book, Chap. 23. &amp; 24. ſaith, <hi>That the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants was not derived from the authority of Man, neither of Councels, but from the Tradition or Doctrine of the Apoſtles.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Cyril</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus,</hi> Chap. 8. approveth the Baptiſm of Children, and condemneth the iteration of Baptiſm. Theſe Authorities of Men I do alledge, not to tie the Baptiſm of Children unto the Teſtimonies of Men, but to ſhew how Mens Teſtimonies do agree with God's Word, and that the verity of Antiquity is on our ſide, and that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> have nothing but Lies for them, and new Imaginations, which feign the Baptiſm of Children to be the Pope's Commandment.</p>
                           <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52190:558"/>
                           <p>After this will I anſwer to the ſum of your Arguments for the contrary. The firſt, which includeth all the reſt, is, It is Written, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and Preach the glad Tidings to all Creatures. He that believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be Saved: But he that believeth not ſhall be Damned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, That nothing is added to God's Word by Baptiſm of Children, as you pretend, but that is done which the ſame Word doth require, for that Children are accounted of Chriſt in the Goſpel among the number of ſuch as believe, as it appeareth by theſe words; <hi>He that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</note> 
                              <hi>one of theſe little Babes which believe in me, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to have a Milſtone tyed about his Neck, and to be caſt into the bottom of the Sea.</hi> Where plainly Chriſt calleth ſuch as be not able to confeſs their Faith, Believers; becauſe of his mere Grace he reputeth them for Believers. And this is no Wonder ſo to be taken, ſince God imputeth Faith for Righteouſneſs unto Men that be of riper Age: For both in Men and Children, Righteouſneſs, Acceptation, or Sanctification is of mere Grace and by Imputation, that the Glory of God's Grace might be praiſed.</p>
                           <p>And that the Children of Faithful Parents are Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and among ſuch as do believe, is apparent in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> 7. And whereas you do gather by the order of the words in the ſaid Commandment of Chriſt, that Children ought to be taught before they be Baptized, and to this end you alledge many places out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> proving that ſuch as Confeſſed their Faith firſt, were Baptized after: I anſwer, That if the order of words might weigh any thing to this Cauſe, we have the Scripture that maketh as well for us. St. <hi>Mark</hi> we read, that <hi>John</hi> did Baptize in the Deſart, <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Mark</hi> 1.</note> Preaching the Baptiſm of Repentance. In the which place we ſee Baptizing go before, and Preaching to follow after.</p>
                           <p>And alſo I will declare this place of <hi>Matthew</hi> exactly conſidered, to make for the uſe of Baptiſm in Children, for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it written in this wiſe; <hi>All Power is</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note> 
                              <hi>given me</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going forth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, that is, <hi>Diſciple ye,</hi> (as I may expreſs the ſignification of the Word;) that is, make or gather to me Diſciples of all Nations. And following, he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52190:559"/> declareth the way how they ſhould gather to him Diſciples out of all Nations, <hi>baptizing them and teaching;</hi> by bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and teaching ye ſhall procure a Church to me. And both theſe aptly and briefly ſeverally he ſetteth forth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded you.</hi> Now then Baptiſm goeth before Doctrine.</p>
                           <p>But hereby I do not gather; that the Gentiles which never heard any thing before of God, and of the Son of God, and of the Holy Ghoſt, ought to be Baptized, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would permit themſelves to be Baptized before they knew to what end. But this I have declared to ſhew you upon how feeble Foundation the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And plainly it is not true which they imagine of this Text, that the Lord did only command ſuch to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, whom the Apoſtles had firſt of all taught. Neither here verily is ſignified who only be to be Baptized, but he ſpeaketh of ſuch as be of perfect age, and of the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Faith, and of the Church to be planted among the Gentiles, which were as yet rude and ignorant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                           <p>Such as be of Age may hear, believe, and confeſs, that which is Preached and taught, but ſo cannot Infants; therefore we may juſtly collect, that he ſpeaketh here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Infants or Children. But for all this they be not to be excluded from Baptiſm.</p>
                           <p>It is a general rule; <hi>He that doth not Labour, muſt not Eat.</hi> But who is ſo barbarous that might think hereby, that Children ſhould be Famiſhed?</p>
                           <p>The Lord ſent his Apoſtles at the beginning of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his true Religion unto all Nations, unto ſuch as were both ignorant of God, and were out of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God; and truly ſuch Perſons it behoved not firſt to be taught, and after baptized. If at this day we ſhould go to the <hi>Turks</hi> to Convert them to the Faith of Chriſt, verily firſt we ought to teach them, and afterward Baptize ſuch as would yield to be the Servants of Chriſt. Likewiſe the Lord himſelf in times paſt did, when firſt he renewed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52190:559"/> the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ordained Circumciſion to be a Seal of the Covenant after that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. But he, when he perceived the Infants alſo to pertain to the Covenant, and that Circumciſion was the ſealing up of the Covenant, did not only Circumciſe <hi>Iſmael</hi> his Son that was 13 years of Age, but all other Infants that were born in his Houſe, among whom we reckon <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Even ſo Faithful People which were Converted from Heathen Idolatry by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and Confeſſing the Faith, were Baptized; when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their Children to be counted among the People of GOD, and that Baptiſm was the Token of the People of GOD, they procured alſo their Children to be baptized. Therefore as it is written; Abraham <hi>Circumciſed all the Male Children of his Houſe.</hi> Semblably we read in the Acts and Writings of the Apoſtles, that after the Maſter of the Houſe was turned to the Faith, all the whole Houſe was baptized. And as concerning thoſe which of old time were compelled to Confeſs their Faith before they received Baptiſm, which were called <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> they were ſuch as with our Fore-Fathers came from the Gentiles to the Church, who being yet rude of Faith, they did inſtruct in the Principles of their Belief, and afterward they did Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them; but the ſame Ancient Fathers notwithſtanding did Baptize the Children of Faithful Men, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready partly declared.</p>
                           <p>And becauſe you do require a haſty anſwer of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of one that is but a dull Writer, I am here enforced to ceaſe particularly to go through your Letter in anſwering thereto, knowing that I have fully anſwered every part thereof, in that I have already written, although not in ſuch order as it had been meet, and as I purpoſed. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as I underſtand that you will be no Contentious Man, neither in this matter, neither in any other, contrary to the judgment of Chriſt's Primitive Church, which is the Body and fulneſs of Chriſt, I deſire you in the intire love of him, or rather Chriſt deſireth you by me (that your joy may be perfect, whereto you are now called) to ſubmit your Judgment to that Church, and to be at Peace
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52190:560"/> and Unity with the ſame; that the Coat of Chriſt which ought to be without Seam, but now alas, moſt miſerably is torn in pieces by many dangerous Sects and Damnable Opinions, may appear by you in no part to have been rent, neither that any giddy Head in theſe Dog-days, might take an enſample by you to diſſent from Chriſt's true Church: I beſeech thee, Dear Brother, in the Goſpel, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteps of the Faith of the Glorious Martyrs in the Primitive Church, and of ſuch as at this day follow the ſame; decline from them neither to the Right Hand nor to the Left. Then ſhall Death, be it never ſo bitter, be more ſweeter than this Life; then ſhall Chriſt with all the Heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> triumphantly imbrace your Spirit with unſpeakable Gladneſs and Exaltation, who in this Earth was content to joyn your Spirit with their Spirits, according as it is commanded by the Word, That the Spirit of Prophets ſhould be ſubject to the Prophets. One thing ask with <hi>David</hi> ere you depart, and require the ſame, that you may dwell with a full accord in his Houſe, for there is Glory and Worſhip: And ſo with <hi>Simeon</hi> in the Temple embracing Chriſt, depart in Peace: To the which <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> Peace Chriſt bring both you and me, and all our loving Brethren that love GOD in the Unity of Faith, by ſuch ways as ſhall pleaſe him, to his Glory. Let the bitter Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt which he ſuffered for your ſake, and the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Torments which the Godly Martyrs of Chriſt have endured before us, and alſo the ineſtimable Reward of your Life to come, which is hidden yet a little while from you with Chriſt, ſtrengthen, comfort, and encourage you to the end of that Glorious Race which you are in. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:562"/> 
                           <hi>weighty</hi> as they have been <hi>numerous,</hi> as if the Objectors had an Eye to that direction in <hi>Quintilian,</hi> they would <note place="margin">L. 5. c. 20. <hi>Infirmiora Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenta Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greganda ſunt, imbecilla enim naturâ, mutuo auxilio ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur.</hi>

                        <p>My buſineſs therefore in handling this <hi>Caſe,</hi> ſhall not be to follow every nice Scruple, or trivial Objection (as where the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> hath been charg'd with the breach of every particular Precept in the Decalogue) not to concern my ſelf in any thing, which either by long Induction of conſequences hath been far fetcht, or with great difficulty drawn in, to make a ſhow of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but, as briefly and plainly as may be to ſum up all that hath ever ſeem'd of any Moment in this matter, and that under this twofold Head.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> hath been ſo notoriouſly abus'd to the worſt purpoſes of Superſtition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> that the retaining of it ſtill amongſt us, makes us partakers of the Superſtitions and Idolatry of <hi>that Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. That it ſeem's the introducing of a <hi>New Sacrament,</hi> which having not the warranty of our Lord and Maſter <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> muſt needs be a very Offenſive invaſion of <hi>his</hi> Rights, whoſe Royal Prerogative alone it is to inſtitute what <hi>Sacraments</hi> he pleaſeth in <hi>his</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>Under theſe two Heads I think may be fairly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all thoſe Objections <hi>our Brethren</hi> have offer'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sign of the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> at leaſt all thoſe that are any thing Material. Inſomuch that if the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of theſe could be remov'd, we might fairly hope, none of the Sober and Conſcientious Diſſenters, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:562"/> would think themſelves oblig'd to ſubmit to the uſe of it, rather than maintain the Separation upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                        <p>And this ſhall be endeavour'd with all the Candor and Clearneſs that becomes the deſign of this, and the reſt of thoſe Diſcourſes that have been Publiſht of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> to Convince and not Reproach or Provoke any: to Effect (if poſſible) the happy agreement, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enlarge and ſtrengthen the intereſts of good Men. And for this purpoſe I have thought fit not to quote the writings of particular Perſons, but rather to repreſent the Objection, as what is in general avow'd and agreed upon by the whole Party.</p>
                        <p>And although it is not likely that any thing ſhould be <hi>here</hi> offer'd, that hath not been already with great Learning and Integrity made uſe of, by the many aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>our Church;</hi> yet perhaps, the bringing this under one view, without the <hi>Warmth</hi> or <hi>Salt</hi> of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary may not prove altogether Vain and Ineffectual.</p>
                        <p>I. I begin therefore, with the firſt Objection, <hi>viz. That the Sign of the Croſs hath been ſo notoriouſly abus'd to the worſt purpoſes of Superſtition and Idolatry in the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>that the retaining of it ſtill amongſt us, makes us Partakers of the Superſtitions and Idolatry of that</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>I muſt readily acknowledg that the Material Figure of the <hi>Croſs</hi> hath been indeed abus'd to very <hi>Idolatrous</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and even the aereal Sign of it to Purpoſes ſuperſtitious and ridiculous enough, and if what we do in uſing this Sign in Baptiſm, were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeable with <hi>Popery,</hi> it would be a ſufficient reaſon to deteſt and Reject it. The Objection therefore at the firſt view looks plauſibly enough, when it thus chargeth this Ceremony of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> Paganiſm it ſelf being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:563"/> more Odious, nor in Truth (for ſome very good Reaſons amongſt wiſe Men,) more Ridiculous and Into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. There is ſcarce any part of <hi>Popery,</hi> properly ſo called, but is ſo plain a dpravation of Chriſtianity it ſelf, ſuch a contradiction to the Rules, ſuch a defeat to the great purpoſes and ends of our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> that it deſerves well enough the good Mans Juſteſt abhorrency, which he may reaſonably expreſs, when he finds himſelf in any real danger of the Snare. But then, we muſt conſider, how eaſie and natural a thing it is for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (that otherwiſe mean honeſtly enough) to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour a Juſt and Reaſonable Offence againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> into groundleſs Suſpicions upon things which have no ſuch Tendency at all in them: And upon theſe firſt Suſpicions not only to ſtartle, and grow a little ſhy and nice, but to determine themſelves in reſolv'd &amp; unmoveable Prejudices, that have had Effects ill enough. For upon this, deſigning Men have made their advantage upon every trifling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, giving out the word, and laying the charge of <hi>Popery,</hi> upon what it hath been their humour or intereſt to deſire a change in. And this probably we ſhall find to have happen'd in this <hi>Caſe</hi> in hand. The accuſation hath been drawn againſt it that it is very <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and the Prejudices which this Accuſation hath begot in ſome honeſt Minds, are ſo ſtrong that they ſeem invincible. How unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably therefore this charge is laid againſt our uſe of the <hi>Sign of the Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm may appear when we have conſidered theſe three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That the uſe of this Sign was much more ancient, than the firſt Corruption and Depravation of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. That the uſe of it, as it is ordain'd and appointed in our <hi>Church,</hi> hath not the leaſt affinity with the uſe of it, as it is in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Rituals.</p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:563"/>
                        <p n="3">III. Laſt. Although it cannot be deny'd but the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath greatly abus'd this Ceremony to very ill purpoſes of Superſtition, yet doth not this make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to continue the Reform'd uſe of it ſtill amongſt us that have profeſſedly ſeparated from the Corruptions of <hi>that Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">I. Conſider we that the uſe of this Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> was much more ancient than the firſt Corruption and Depravation of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> When I ſpeak of the <hi>firſt Corruption and Depravation</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I would be underſtood as to thoſe things that have put <hi>that Church</hi> under the Imputation of what we now call <hi>Popery.</hi> For that there were ſome deprav'd Cuſtoms crept into the Church in general (and ſo that of <hi>Rome</hi> perhaps as well as any other) in very early days, is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what St. <hi>Paul</hi> Rebukes in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and from what our Saviour himſelf in his <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> to St. <hi>John,</hi> Condemns in the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> So that, when I ſay the uſe of the <hi>Croſs</hi> was more ancient than the firſt Corruption and Depravation of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> I mean, more ancient than any of thoſe Corruptions in her by the reaſon of which, we have juſtly eſteem'd her an <hi>Apoſtatiz'd Church,</hi> more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient than either the Introduction of Images, their Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Sacraments, their pretentions to Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Infallibility, or any of thoſe Superſtitious Rites in Worſhip, by which we diſtinguiſh <hi>that Church</hi> as <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and brand it as falſe and <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to this therefore, I know none of our Diſſenting <note place="margin">
                              <hi>By which Phraſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in Truth meant, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret workings of the</hi> Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks <hi>of</hi> that <hi>Age.</hi>
                           </note> Brethren, however for a ſhift in Argument they may talk of the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> beginning to work betimes; and in the firſt Ages of the Church *, that yet do profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly charge any <hi>Signal</hi> Apoſtaſy upon the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> at leaſt for the firſt four hundred Years after Chriſt: not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:564"/> to the Age wherein St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> Flouriſht; but that it was a Church that might be Communicated with at that time, notwithſtanding <hi>that</hi> Father complain'd of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfaetation of Ceremonies even then, which (at leaſt for the Number of them) began to be very burdenſom. And yet, for an Hundred or two of Years before this, we find in the Writings of <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſuch mention of the uſe of <hi>this</hi> Sign, that makes it very plain, it had been a Cuſtomary thing long before his time alſo, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, even amongſt thoſe of the Apoſtolical Age it ſelf. There are thoſe indeed that would make that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt that brought in the uſe of this Ceremony into the Church, having receiv'd it from the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> of whom he ſeems to have been particularly fond. But the frequent and familiar mention he makes of the Sign of the Croſs in many of his Books renders this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture very improbable. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us it was grown ſo much in uſe in his time, that <hi>upon every motion of theirs,</hi> at their <hi>going out and coming in, when they put on their Garments or Shooes, at the Bath, or at Meals when they lighted up their Candles, or went to Bed, whatever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they did in any part of their Converſation, ſtill they</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Frontem crucis ſignaculo tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> Tertul. <hi>de Coron. mil.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>would even wear out their Forheads with the Sign of the Croſs;</hi> which though he confeſſeth there was no expreſs Law of Chriſt that had enjoyn'd it, yet <hi>Tradition had Introduc'd, Cuſtom had Confirm'd, and the Believers Faith had obſerv'd and maintain'd it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This doth not look as if it had been a thing newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Montanus,</hi> and brought into the Church by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as being himſelf too great a Favourer of that Sect. Although, were it thus indeed, yet this ſheweth that the Practice of it was receiv'd among the Faithful, ſome Ages before the Depravation and Apoſtacy of the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> But he is not our ſingle Author in this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:564"/> matter: for, <hi>Origen</hi> who Flouriſht not much above CC <note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>But of all the Fathers, St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was before St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and very near if not contemporary with <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> himſelf, not only ſpeaks moſt Familiarly of the uſe of this Sign, but hath ſome Expreſſions in this matter, that would ſeem very harſh and unwarrantable now; and yet, the Authority of that Father, hath ſav'd him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto from being brought under queſtion about it. He tells us in one place, that in <hi>fronte cruce ſignantur, qui Dominum promerentur,</hi> i. e. <hi>they are Sign'd in the Forehead with the Croſs who are thought worthy of the Lord,</hi> and in another place, <hi>Omnia ſacramenta peragit, it Compleats e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sacrament,</hi> and <hi>per crucem baptiſma ſanctificatur, Baptiſm is Sanctified by the Croſs.</hi> I will not ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the Juſtifiableneſs of theſe paſſages, were they to be allow'd no kind of Latitude: but, as to the purpoſe for which they are cited they ſeem pertinent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: that is, to Argue the antiquity of this uſage (and that in the Sacrament of Baptiſm too) the Phraſe ſo frequently occurring in the writings of thoſe ancient Fathers, that <hi>fronte ſignati, being ſign'd in the Forehead,</hi> ſeems a known and uſual <hi>Periphraſis</hi> for being enter'd into the Faith of Chriſt and the Body of his Church by Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>After all which, what need I Inſtance in St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> St.

Nay, I may further add, that in ſome of the paſſages they have of this kind, the hint they take may not deſerve perhaps to be abſolutely exploded, as if there were no weight or moment at all in it. I will crave leave to inſtance par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in one thing which ſome of the Fathers do a little inſiſt upon, and that is, that <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. that was <hi>to be ſet upon the Foreheads of the Men that ſigh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Mark</hi> in ſeveral of the ancient Verſions is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be the <hi>Hebrew Tau,</hi> which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us was, in the Samaritan Character, like our T, and ſo made the figure of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> from whence he Collects that this was <hi>ſignum crucis quae in Chriſtianorum frontibus pingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, a token of that Croſs that is imprinted upon the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Chriſtian.</hi> If St. <hi>Hierom</hi> be not miſtaken in the Samaritan Character, his conjecture in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, is not very unjuſtifiable; becauſe, as <hi>all the promiſes are in Chriſt Jeſus, yea, and in him Amen:</hi> So, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</note> all the Propheſies of old, where they concern'd any ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantages or deliverances to the Jewiſh Church had the aſſurance of them frequently confirm'd by ſome hint or Remembrance of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was afterward to be reveal'd.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:566"/> of ſo immediate Deliverance, but that it was brought in as an inſtance, (not only that as God could bring about ſuch a wonder, as the Birth of a Child from a Virgin, could as eaſily relieve <hi>Judah</hi> in its preſent ſtreights: but further,) he that had ſo gracious a deſign toward them, as to ſend the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> amongſt them, would in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he had to that, ſhow now his particular regards for the Church at this time.

                        <p>And thus, having ſhewen the Antiquity of <hi>this Sign,</hi> as it was receiv'd into the Church long before the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of <hi>Popery</hi> appear'd in the World; I know but of one thing can be urg'd to take off the ſtrength of what hath been hitherto ſaid; and that is, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians might probably take up this Cuſtom of thus ſigning themſelves, becauſe they liv'd wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, the <hi>Jews making the Croſs a Stumbling-block, and the Greeks Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs.</hi> So that, their deſign of doing it, was only to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:567"/> bear their Teſtimony to the Faces of both, that is, tho the Croſs was ſcandal to the one, and ſcorn and laughter to the other, yet they would not be aſhamed of this Croſs but made it the Badg of their Profeſſion. Whereas we live in an Age and Nation, where (thanks be to God) there ſeems no ſuch occaſion, becauſe Chriſtianity is the Religion we openly and univerſally profeſs.</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer, that this Objection being thus made, doth at leaſt ſuppoſe the uſage of the Croſs not to be a thing that is in it ſelf evil, becauſe if ſo, no good end or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in uſing it could hallow the Action; ſo that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is not Evil in its ſelf, but that upon ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſons, it might be brought into the Church, if ſo, then we might reaſonably think, that the injunction of Authority in this Caſe, might Juſtifie the Practice of it. But much more, if the reaſon now alledg'd might be a juſt occaſion for the Church in its firſt Ages to take the uſage up, God knows the occaſion may be as urgent ſtill upon an Equally ſad account: and that is, the Prophane and Atheiſtical Contempt that is thrown, not ſo much upon the <hi>Sign</hi> as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Croſs, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Wits of our Age. He hath a very ſlender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for the intereſts of Religion, that is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly toucht with thoſe Blaſphemous Railleries he may every where meet with, upon the whole Scheme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, eſpecially that which we make the great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our hopes and truſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Merits of our Saviours Croſs and Paſſion. That the uſe of this Sign, if ever it was reaſonable upon ſuch a ſcore as this, it is ſo now.

                        <p>And now, ſince it is ſo evident how Ancient a practice this hath been in the Chriſtian Church: I would not have this part of the Argument pretended further than it was firſt deſign'd, which was only to ſhow that this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony hath nothing owing in it to that which we call <hi>Popery,</hi> becauſe it was eſtabliſht in the Church ſo long before that <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> had its being. And tho through the Antiquity of it (if warrantable at the firſt) it becomes ſo much the more Venerable, and might juſtly lay ſome reſtraints upon the modeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in his Cenſures againſt it; yet doth not this put it beyond the degree of an <hi>indifferent Ceremony,</hi> without which, the Sacrament of Baptiſm is declar'd by our <hi>Church</hi> as complete and perfected. Did the Antiquity of its practice make it neceſſary, it might prove as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry almoſt in every Action of Life, as well as Baptiſm, becauſe (as I have noted before) <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, it was once ſo uſed. No, it only gives us the warrant of doing it, becauſe practis'd in the moſt incorrupt Ages of Chriſtianity; and the neceſſity of keeping it ſtill in uſe, lyes not ſo much in that it was the Cuſtom of ſome Church, or Conſtitution of ſome Council in former days, as that it is the Cuſtom of our Church now, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of our Governours. But,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is further conſiderable, that the uſe of the Croſs as it is ordain'd and appointed in our <hi>Church,</hi> hath not the leaſt affinity with the uſe of it, as it is in the <hi>Romiſh Rituals.</hi>
                        </p>

The uſe even of this tranſient ſign, bears no kind of Conformity or likeneſs with the uſe of it in the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> They uſe it upon numberleſs occaſions beſide Baptiſm.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:569"/> it would go nigh to throw a ſcorn upon all or moſt ſo the Reformations that have been made from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> for they do not ſeem to have govern'd themſelves by this Rule.

                        <p>It is a Principle that would render Chriſtianity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, becauſe no Circumſtance, no Inſtrument, no Miniſtry in Worſhip, but may have been ſome way or other abus'd and deſecrated by <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Romiſh</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. It would make every Garment of what ſhape, or of what colour ſoever, unfit for uſe in our Religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: for, not only the White, but the Red, the Green, and the Black, have been us'd (even for the ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their reſpective colours) by the <hi>Gentile,</hi> or the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> to very ſuperſtitious purpoſes in divine Worſhip. It would condemn the Practice of thoſe very Perſons that would pretend this to be their Principle.

                        <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, Although it is very natural to mankind to govern themſelves more by example than precept, yet, Arguments fetcht from examples, generally are not the trueſt way of reaſoning; and that partly upon this very account, namely, the proneneſs we have toward example, and Byaſs and Prejudice we may the eaſilier be drawn away with, upon that account. But chiefly, becauſe in alledging examples, it is very rare that we can hit the Caſe perfectly right. It may be ſaid of <hi>Examples,</hi> as it is of <hi>Similitudes;</hi> they ſeldom do <hi>Currere quatuor pedibus,</hi> they do not perfectly reach the thing intended to be prov'd, but are ſo widely different, or defective in ſome one or other Circumſtance, that there is not that parity of Reaſon that ought to be; and the varying of Circumſtances may much alter the Caſe. Which very thing apparently falls out in this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For certainly, if the example be concern'd in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing with reſpect to our practice, it may ſeem to prove nothing further than the neceſſity of taking away (not what hath been us'd only to Idolatrous purpoſes, but) what it ſelf hath been, and at that inſtant is, a meer Idol. This was the Circumſtance of the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> it was by Cuſtom become a real Idol; it had been ſo for a long time, was ſo at that inſtant, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> brake it to pieces: <hi>to thoſe days the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did</hi>
                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:570"/> 
                           <hi>burn Incenſe unto it.</hi> So that, thus far perhaps this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might affect us, that, were there any <hi>Crucifix,</hi> or material image of our Saviour upon the Croſs, now ſtanding, to which People for ſome Ages had given, and for the generality did ſtill give divine honour; it would then indeed concern the Government, in their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Idolatries of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to take away and aboliſh <hi>this</hi> and all other <hi>Images</hi> of this kind. This perhaps anſwers the pattern pretty much, and copieth out <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s wiſe and good Action; and this accordingly is entirely done in <hi>our Church;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſuch <hi>Image</hi> abiding now amongſt us, to which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny adoration is publickly avow'd, or that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have ſuch ſnare in it, as to hazard any general Idolatry. What proportion doth our <hi>Aerial ſign of the Croſs</hi> (toward which there is no intention, nor indeed any poſſibility of giving any divine Worſhip,) what proportion doth this bear to the material figure of the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> to which they had for a long time actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>burnt Incenſe,</hi> did it <hi>to thoſe very days,</hi> and gave ſuch Evidence of their Inveteracy in Idolatry, that there ſeem'd no moral likelihood of preventing it by any other courſe than breaking the <hi>Idol</hi> to pieces, and letting them ſee what a meer <hi>lump of Braſs</hi> they had been Worſhipping? But then,</p>
                        <p>2. If Example were a good way of Arguing, we find by <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s practice in other things, he did not think it an indiſpenſible Duty in him to aboliſh every thing that had been made uſe of to Idolatry, if they did not prove an immediate ſnare at that time; for, as to Temples which <hi>Solomon</hi> had erected for no other end but the Worſhip of falſe Gods in them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 7. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did not make it his buſineſs to deſtroy them, as being in his time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and neglected things, of which no bad uſe was then
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:570"/> made. Although indeed King <hi>Joſiah</hi> afterward (proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon the encreaſe of Idolatry, and renewed uſe of thoſe places) foued it expedient to lay them wholly waſte. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 13.</p>
                        <p>And thus much I have thought fit to ſay as to that firſt Head of Objection againſt the ſign of the Croſs, as it is cry'd out againſt as <hi>a Relick of Popery,</hi> and had been ſo deprav'd by the Superſtitious uſe of it in the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> I cannot but acknowledg this to be the weakeſt part of their plea againſt it; and probably <hi>our Brethren</hi> know it to be ſo too: yet, becauſe it is moſt affecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt common People, and ſeems to have made the deepeſt impreſſion upon thoſe that are not ſo well fitted for profound and ſolid reaſoning, I have choſen to be the larger here, that even the meaneſt capacities may ſee that the Sign of the Croſs, as we uſe it, was not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> but was of a much ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter date: That the uſe we make of it bears no Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity at all with <hi>that Church</hi> in their uſing it: that by our different uſage we keep at a ſufficient diſtance; nay, perhaps are in leſs likelyhood of falling into the Snare of their Communion, than if it had been utterly aboliſht: In a word, that that very Principle, upon which the charge of <hi>Popery</hi> is laid as an Argument againſt the Croſs, is it ſelf weak and fallible; nor are we bound by any Precept or Example in Holy Writ, to throw off the uſe of any one thing meerly becauſe the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath abus'd it. It hath prov'd a mighty inconvenience to the Church, that People have been thrown into ſo precipitant a Zeal of removing themſelves to the utmoſt extreams from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that they have been almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to determine in any action or circumſtance of Divine Worſhip, leſt it ſhould ſome way or other, have been Prophan'd and made unwarrantable by their practice.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:571"/> This is that gave riſe to the miſchievous Enthuſiaſms in <hi>Germany,</hi> that ended in ſuch bloody and barbarous Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, as well as ſenſleſs and ridiculous Principles taken up and maintain'd by the Anabaptiſts there. I am loth to mention the horrid confuſions of our own Age and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which yet perhaps we were wrought up into by this very humour; I mean, a reſtleſs fondneſs for ſome additional refinements ſtill, which our <hi>Church</hi> had not thought fit to make.</p>
                        <p>I cannot but inwardly reverence the Judgment, as well as love the Temper, of our firſt Reformers, who in their firſt Separations from <hi>Rome,</hi> were not nice or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous beyond the juſt reaſons of things. Doubtleſs they were in earneſt enough, as to all true Zeal againſt the Corruptions of <hi>that Church,</hi> when they ſeal'd the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded offence they took at them, with their warmeſt bloud; and cheerfully underwent all the hardſhips that Primitive Chriſtians ſignalized their Profeſſion with, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they would intermix with <hi>Rome,</hi> in any uſage of Worſhip, or Article of Faith that had the leaſt ſavour of Idolatry, Superſtition, or falſe Religion at all in it. And yet theſe Holy and Wiſe Men, when they had the Power and Opportunity of Reforming, wholly in their Hands, being equally jealous of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> as they were of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> would not give themſelves up to thoſe <hi>fantaſtick Antipathies</hi> as to aboliſh this or that Ceremony, meerly becauſe it had been in uſe amongſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if ſome other very ſubſtantial Reaſon did not put in its claim againſt it. And verily, had they not Governed themſelves in theſe temperate and unbyaſt methods of Reformation, they would not ſo eaſily have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified themſelves to their Adverſaries, or the World; or have made it ſo evident (as by their wiſe management they did) that what was done by them was from the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:571"/> mere urgencies of Conſcience and Reaſon, and not the wantonneſs of Change and Innovation. So that, where any mean honeſtly (as I doubt not but many of thoſe do, that Diſſent from us in this particular circumſtance of the Croſs in Baptiſm) they ought to have their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very well awake, that the meer charge of <hi>Popery</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any diſputed point, may not ſo prejudice them in their enquiries into things as to leave no Room for debate and mature Conſideration.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The other head of Objection againſt the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm is, <hi>that it ſeems the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a new Sacrament, which having not the warranty of our Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, muſt needs be a very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive invaſion of his Rights, whoſe Royal Prerogative alone it is, to inſtitute what Sacraments he pleaſeth in his Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Objection ſeems to point at a twofold argument. The one, with reſpect in Common to all thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in Worſhip, which for <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> are appointed by the Governours of the Church, but not antecedently preſcrib'd and enjoyn'd in the word of God. For, to do this, our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> have generally affirm'd it a bold and unwarrantable intruſion upon our <hi>Lord and Maſter,</hi> who was <hi>faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his Houſe,</hi> that is, in preſcribing to the <hi>Jews</hi> all their modes and uſages in Worſhip, from which they were not to vary or deviate, to add or diminiſh in any one Circumſtance.</p>
                        <p>This I ſhall take no further notice of, than as it may neceſſarily intermix it ſelf with the queſtion particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hand about the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> partly becauſe I would keep as ſtrictly as may be to this diſtinct <hi>Caſe,</hi> and eſpecially, becauſe this Caſe [of doing nothing in or about the Worſhip of God, but what is expreſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:572"/> and appointed by <hi>him</hi> in his word] hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's province; ſo that, I ſhall only ſay, the Cuſtoms of the Jewiſh Church it ſelf, (which <hi>our Brethren</hi> would make their main inſtance in this matter,) do make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt it. They did unqueſtionably take up ſome uſages wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> had given no antecedent directions, which yet it is evident were not unlawful upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> did not only not blame or accuſe them of Encroachment or Superſtition, but <hi>himſelf</hi> practis'd &amp; comply'd with them; this, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, hath been clear'd up in the inſtance of their Synagogue Worſhip, and upon another occaſion may be further inſiſted on by and by. Beſides, it is plain, this was no Rule amongſt the primitive Chriſtians in the firſt ages of the Goſpel, not to add, the inexpediency and unfitneſs of this Rule to the very Oeconomy and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Chriſtianity, which was to diffuſe it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Nations, and all kinds of People, who did ſo infinitely differ from one another, both in their Cuſtoms, and in the Significations of thoſe Cuſtoms too, that it muſt have been a vaſt and bulky <hi>digeſt</hi> of Laws indeed, that muſt have ſuited all Countries, were every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Punctilio in divine Worſhip to have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently preſcrib'd. All this hath been with ſo much clearneſs made out by ſeveral Hands, that I am apt to think at this time of the day, <hi>our Brethren</hi> do not expect or ſtand in need of further Conviction in this point, and ſeem in ſome meaſure agreed that this Poſition of theirs will not hold water.</p>
                        <p>It is the other part of the Objection therefore, that will fall more directly under our conſideration at this preſent; and that is, that our uſing the <hi>ſign of the Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm, doth ſeem to run into the nature of a <hi>new Sacrament.</hi> And this is that they mean, when they tell
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:572"/> us, <hi>it is an outward Viſible ſign of an inward inviſible Grace, whereby a Perſon is dedicated to the Profeſſion of, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Redeemer.</hi> That it is <hi>a dedicating means to conſecrate us to God;</hi> that it <hi>ſignifies our covenanting engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is as a Badg and Symbol of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> that it <hi>repreſents Chriſt dying on the Croſs, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies our being liſted under Chriſt;</hi> that it is <hi>an addition to Baptiſm;</hi> that it <hi>adds another Sacrament to Baptiſm: And that it is uſed as an engaging Sign, in our firſt and ſolemn covenanting with Chriſt, and the duties whereunto we are really oblig'd by Baptiſm, are more expreſly affixt to that aery Sign than to the Holy Sacrament.</hi> With many other Expreſſions of this kind, which we may find interſpers'd in the ſeveral writings of the Nonconformiſts, where they take occaſion to diſpute this Ceremony. This of the Croſſes <hi>having at leaſt the ſemblance of a Sacrament,</hi> is indeed the only Objection the <hi>Presbyterian Brethren</hi> inſiſt upon in their <hi>exceptions againſt ſome paſſages in the preſent Liturgy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to this therefore, firſt, I muſt needs ſay, I have ſometimes wonder'd that the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> it ſelf, hath been ſo well agreed upon amongſt us. The <hi>Fathers</hi> have us'd it ſo much at large in their writings that it would ſometimes be difficult to underſtand what they mean by it: and <hi>our Brethren,</hi> upon the ſame reaſons by which ſeveral other exceptions have been made, might have diſallow'd and rejected it as a <hi>word</hi> by no means <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> but <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh.</hi> However, ſince by a long reception of the <hi>word</hi> into the Church, it ſeems a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on all ſides, what the Senſe and Acceptation of it ſhould be; my buſineſs will be to ſhew, 1. What we are agreed in as to the Notion of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and then 2. to make it plain, that as <hi>our Church</hi> never did deſign or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:573"/> intend, by the uſe of the croſs in Baptiſm to make an <hi>new Sacrament</hi> of it; ſo, in the nature of the thing, it hath not any <hi>ſemblance of a Sacrament,</hi> according to the Notion of a <hi>Sacrament</hi> that both ſides are agreed in.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, As to our being agreed in the Notion of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> I muſt preſume <hi>our Church</hi> in her publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, hath given that definition of it, which no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, but approves and allows of. That is, that <hi>it is an outward and Viſible Sign of an inward and Spiritual Grace given to us, Ordain'd by Chriſt himſelf, as a means whereby we receive the ſame, and a Pledg to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us thereof.</hi> It is true, the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> in their larger Catechiſm do in that queſtion of their's <hi>[what is a Sacrament?]</hi> put in an expreſſion or two, that point at ſome Opinions, wherein they may be no more agreed amongſt themſelves, than they are with ſome of our Church. But then, in their next queſtion <hi>[what are the parts of a Sacrament]</hi> they give us the ſame account with that of our Church-Catechiſm, only a little vary'd in the words, <hi>viz. The parts of a Sacrament are two, the one, an outward ſenſible ſign uſed according to Chriſts own appointment: the other, an inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace thereby ſignifi'd.</hi> by all which it is evident, we are well enough agreed in the Common acceptation of the word <hi>Sacrament.</hi> And therefore,</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I proceed to ſhew, that as our Church never did deſign or intend, by the uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm, to make any <hi>new Sacrament</hi> of it, ſo according to the common Notion wherein we are agreed as to the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> there is not <hi>any ſemblance of a Sacrament</hi> it can juſtly be charg'd with.</p>
                        <p>And here I might, not without ſome reaſon, inſiſt, that as we are agreed in the Definition of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that both the <hi>outward Sign</hi> muſt ſignifie an <hi>inward Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:573"/> 
                           <hi>Grace,</hi> and alſo muſt have its <hi>expreſs inſtitution</hi> and <hi>appointment from Chriſt,</hi> we, that never ſuppos'd the uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm could confer Grace, nor have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made the leaſt pretext to any Divine appointment for it, ought not to be charg'd as introducing a <hi>new Sacrament,</hi> when it hath no pretenſions to any one thing that is of the Eſſence of a Sacrament. But I am willing to follow the Argument as they have laid it. They ſay therefore, that however, we do not call or account it an <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> yet foraſmuch as we bring a Ceremony into the Church, which in the Significations of it ſeems <hi>tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> to a Chriſtian Sacrament, we do thereby uſurp the Prerogative of our great Lord and Maſter, <hi>ſetting up our Poſts againſt his Poſt, and our Threſhold again his Threſhold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This they ſay we do partly, 1. as we make the Croſs a ſign betokening our Faith, and Chriſtian courage, when in applying it to the Baptis'd Perſon, we ſay we do it <hi>in token that hereafter he ſhall not be aſham'd to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt Crucifi'd,</hi> &amp;c. And partly 2. when by an intire Repreſentative of <hi>our Church</hi> it is determin'd, that by the ſign of the Croſs, the Baptis'd Perſon is <hi>dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the ſervice of him that dy'd upon the Croſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, they ſay that by making the ſign of the Croſs <hi>in token that hereafter,</hi> &amp;c. we apply ſuch Significations to it, that run it into the nature of a Sacrament, uſing it as <hi>an outward Viſible ſign of an Inward Spiritual Grace.</hi> As to this, we muſt ingeniouſly confeſs, that we make uſe of no Rite or Ceremony in <hi>our Church,</hi> but it is with this deſign, that it ſhould be Significant of ſome thing or other. It would be an odd piece of pageantry indeed, to uſe this or that geſture or action in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervices, that ſhould have no Signification at all in it, and to account it therefore <hi>Innocent,</hi> becauſe it were <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</hi>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:574"/> It is the Significancy of it, that makes it uſeful or proper, and if there were nothing of that in it, it would be very diſallowable. But then, though our Ceremonies are ſignificant, and any of them us'd as Memorative Signs to put us in mind of any <hi>Duty</hi> or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation toward God, they are not therefore <hi>an outward Viſible ſign of an inward Spiritual Grace;</hi> that is, they are not in the nature of any ſeal or aſſurance from God of <hi>his Grace</hi> to us, but hints and remembrances of ſome Obligation <hi>we</hi> are under with reſpect to God. And that this kind of ſignificant uſages have been all along arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily taken up, without any Imputation of <hi>introducing a new Sacrament,</hi> may be made out, both from the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> notwithſtanding the punctual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions deliver'd to them by <hi>Moſes.</hi> From the practice of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> and that, both in the very firſt ages of it, and alſo in all the later Reformations that have been made.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, take we a view of the <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We may obſerve that in their very <hi>Paſſover,</hi> about which, both thing and Circumſtances, they had ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs directions by <hi>Moſes</hi> before they went out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet did they in ſome ages following conſiderably vary, not only in their time of keeping it, which having been originally appointed on the <hi>Tenth,</hi> they chang'd it to the <hi>Fourteenth</hi> day of the Month: but in the geſture too. In the firſt inſtitution of it, they were <hi>to eat it with their loins girded, their ſhooes on their feet, and ſtaff in their hand,</hi> and all as a token of the haſte they were then in. This geſture of eating the Paſſover, it is not ſo certain how long it continu'd in the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as it is unqueſtionable it was chang'd into a <hi>diſcumbing</hi> poſture (that is, a poſture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:574"/> wherein they took their ordinary meals) long before the days of our Saviour, and that ſo warrantably too, that our Saviour himſelf uſed it. And yet, this very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they had taken up (if we will believe an Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that was no great friend to the Ceremonies of <hi>our Church)</hi> had its Signification too; for he tells us that they did it <hi>in ſign of their reſt and ſecurity otherwiſe than</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>they had in</hi> Egypt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another inſtance in the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> might be that of the <hi>Altar of Witneſs,</hi> which <hi>Phineas,</hi> after he had made a jealous enquiry upon, approv'd of, as a ſtanding me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.</note> that they on the other ſide <hi>Jordan</hi> profeſt the true God, had Relation to the other tribes, and a Right to the Service of God in the <hi>Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. But that which ſeems to come neareſt us is what the Jewiſh Authors do frequently take notice of, and that is, that as to thoſe whoſe Office entitled them to <hi>the Anointing</hi> (which by all that doth very evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, were only <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts)</hi> although the <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl,</hi> as to its confection and ingredients, and the manner of doing it (as one would think) were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly enough preſcrib'd by God; yet did the Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves bring in the uſe of a Significative ſign in doing it, which ſeems no where diſſallow'd, or charg'd as an invaſion of Gods Holy Inſtitutions: this was, to Anoint the Heads of their <hi>Kings</hi> with the figure of a <hi>Crown,</hi> and their <hi>Prieſts</hi> with the figure of an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew]</hi> ב <note place="margin">Maimon. II. Melachim.</note> or the <hi>Greek</hi> χ. Not to add, that the <hi>Synagogue Worſhip,</hi> the <hi>Rites of Marriage,</hi> the <hi>form of taking Oaths,</hi> and the like, things that had great Significations in them, had not the expreſs Inſtitution of God for their warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet were well enough receiv'd in the pureſt times of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> and comply'd with by our Saviour himſelf.</p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:575"/>
                        <p>Secondly, take we a view of the Chriſtian Church, and that, both as to the firſt ages of it, and all the later Reformations that have been made. 1. We may obſerve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the days of the Apoſtles themſelves, the Church hath taken the Liberty of making uſe of one Rite or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath ſignifi'd things of greateſt weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to inſtance in a twofold Cuſtom primitively us'd amongſt Chriſtians, that lookt much more <hi>Sacramentally</hi> than our uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm, that is, the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them ſeem'd Apoſtolical, being frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in their Holy writings; and they were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly annext to the Holy Euchariſt, and in their Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication bore ſome analogy with what that Sacrament it ſelf was in part the token and ſeal of, theſe were the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kiſs,</hi> and the <hi>Agapae</hi> or <hi>Feaſts of Charity.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Holy Kiſs</hi> was perform'd (as the beſt Writers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceive) after all other preparations, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before they entred upon the Celebration of the <note place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 20.</note> to <hi>greet one another with an holy kiſs.</hi> And this was kept <note place="margin">Quae oratio cum divortio ſancti oſculi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra?

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:575"/> its Foundation in any <hi>Divine Appointment,</hi> but the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary uſe the Church made of it, ſeems agreed to on all hands; becauſe afterward, it is not only prohibited by ſome Councils, but by an univerſal conſent in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, wholly laid aſide, and grown out of all uſe.</p>
                        <p>Again, we may obſerve, as to that cuſtom of the <hi>Agapae</hi> or <hi>Feaſts of Charity,</hi> which in the Apoſtles days <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 21.</note> probably were celebrated immediately before the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and in ſome Ages afterward, not till the <hi>Holy Communion</hi> was finiſhed. But, whether they had them before, or after, it is certain they had great Significations in them, not only of Chriſtians mutual Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but alſo, of the equal regards that God and our Bleſſed Lord had, toward all ſorts and conditions of Men; the poor as well as the rich, thoſe of meaner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and quality, as well as the high and noble, when they were all to eat freely together at one common meal. This the Apoſtle ſeems to point at, in the remarks he makes upon the diſorders in the Church <hi>at Corinth,</hi> that in their Love-Feaſts, <hi>every one taketh before other his own Supper,</hi> and ſo did <hi>deſpiſe the Church of God.</hi> And <hi>thoſe that had Houſes to Eat and Drink in, ſham'd thoſe that had not.</hi> Now, though this cuſtom was hallowed by the practice of the Apoſtles, and had ſo great Significations in it, and was from the firſt, ſo annext to the <hi>Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> that it always either begun or concluded it, and conſequently lookt much more <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> than our <hi>Sign of the Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm can be ſuppos'd to do; yet is it plain, by the univerſal diſuſe of it, in theſe later ages of the Church, that it ſelf never was eſteem'd any <hi>Sacrament.</hi>

                        <p>I might further inſtance in the Ceremony of <hi>inſuffla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or breathing upon the Perſon that was to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd, <note place="margin">

                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:576"/> which they us'd as a ſign of <hi>expelling the Evil Spirit, and breathing into them the good Spirit;</hi> this ſeem'd to ſignifie more the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> than <hi>Duty of the Chriſtian,</hi> and yet not ſuſpected as any Sacrament. Thus, the Baptized Perſons ſtripping of his Garment in token that <hi>he put off the Old Man which was corrupt according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Luſts,</hi> doth it not look full as <hi>Sacramentally</hi> as our Croſs in Baptiſm? Yet we find it anciently practis'd without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny jealouſie of <hi>invading the prerogative of Chriſt, in inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Holy Sacraments.</hi> To ſay no more, what think we of the <hi>trine immerſion</hi> once accounted a pious uſage in the Church, whereby the Perſon being thrice dipt or put under water, at the mention of each Perſon of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> was ſuppos'd to be Baptiz'd in the beleif of that great Article.

                           <hi>Church</hi> by this uſage. Much ſuch a reaſon (by the way) the Reform'd Churches in <hi>Poland</hi> govern'd themſelves by, when in a general Synod they decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Poſture of ſitting at the Lords Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>that Cuſtom had been brought in firſt by the Arrians, who, as they irreverently treat Chriſt, ſo alſo his ſacred appointments.</hi> Which leads to a view of the Church in all <note place="margin">

                        <p>2. Is it not very evident, that in none of our later Reformations, nay even in thoſe of our <hi>Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> themſelves, but they do in their moſt Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, ſome things that are very Symbolical; Actions that have great ſignifications in them?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There giving to every Baptiz'd Infant a new Name. which both they and we do call the <hi>Chriſtian Name;</hi> this ſeems to betoken <hi>our being made new Creatures,</hi> and <hi>entred into a new State</hi> or Condition of Life, which ſtill they ſeem to aim more expreſly at, in their general care to give the Child ſome <hi>Scripture Name,</hi> or ſome name that ſhould ſignify, ſome excellent vertue or Grace, ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duty owing to God, or ſome memorable benefit receiv'd from him. Here we have an <hi>outward Viſible ſign,</hi> and this too ſometimes of an <hi>inward Spiritual Grace,</hi> and yet this no more accounted a <hi>new Sacrament,</hi> or a <hi>Sacrament</hi> within <hi>that</hi> of Baptiſm, than we do our <hi>Sign of the Croſs;</hi> and indeed there ſeems juſt as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the one as for the other, and no more.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thoſe Arguments which ſome of our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> have us'd in Plea for the poſture of <hi>ſitting at the Lords Supper,</hi> do ſhew, that beſides what they urge from the poſture wherein our Saviour himſelf celebrated it, they apprehend ſome <hi>Significancy</hi> in the geſture, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it more accommodate to that ordinance than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, ſome of them plead for the poſture of <hi>ſitting;</hi> as being moſt properly a <hi>Table-geſture</hi> and doth beſt of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:577"/> all expreſs <hi>our fellowſhip with Chriſt, and the honour and priviledg of Communion with him as Co-heirs.</hi> Now in this matter let us conſider; our Lord hath no where expreſly Commanded us to perform this Sacrament in a ſitting poſture; much leſs hath he told us that he ordain'd <hi>this geſture</hi> in token of our <hi>fellowſhip with him;</hi> ſo that, we ſee this <hi>geſture of ſitting</hi> (by the Tenor of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) made <hi>an outward Viſible ſign of an inward and Spiritual Grace;</hi> and this, not from any antecedent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs inſtitution of Chriſt; which notwithſtanding, this <hi>poſture of ſitting</hi> is not accounted by thoſe that frame the Argument, any <hi>new</hi> or <hi>additional Sacrament</hi> to that of the Lords Supper.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Thoſe of the Congregational way have a formal Covenant, which they inſiſt upon, that whoever will be admitted into any of their <hi>Churches,</hi> muſt engage themſelves in; this is of that importance amongſt them, that they call it, the <hi>Conſtitutive Form of a Church,</hi> that which makes <hi>any particular Perſon Member of a Church.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apol. for Church-coven.</note> Yea, and (as another expreſſes it) that <hi>wherein the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of ſuch a Church doth conſiſt.</hi> We will ſuppoſe then, <hi>this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> adminiſter'd in ſome form or other, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon admitted by <hi>this Covenant</hi> into an <hi>Independant Church</hi> declaring his conſent by ſome Action or other, ſuch as <hi>holding up his Hand,</hi> or the like. Let me ask them, What muſt they of <hi>that Church</hi> think of this Rite, or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of holding up the hand? will they not look upon it as <hi>a token</hi> of his conſent to be a Church-Member? Here then is an <hi>outward Viſible ſign,</hi> of What? of no leſs (according to their apprehenſion of things) than a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>new State and Condition of Life;</hi> that is, of being embody'd in Chriſt's Church, engag'd to all the <hi>Duties</hi> and enſtated in all the <hi>priviledges</hi> of it. Will they ſay that this way of admiſſion, either the form of words wherein <hi>their Covenant</hi> is adminiſtred, or the Ceremony
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:577"/> of <hi>holding up the</hi> hand, by which this Covenant is taken and aſſented to, was originally ordain'd by Chriſt? or do they themſelves eſteem <hi>this</hi> of the nature of a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> or did the <hi>Presbyterian-Brethren,</hi> in all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt this way, charge <hi>them</hi> with introducing a <hi>new Sacrament?</hi> So that, from all inſtances imaginable, both of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church, and that, both Primitive, and later Reformations; even from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular practices of our Diſſenting Brethren, it is very Evident, how unreaſonable a thing it is, that though we ſign the baptiz'd perſon with the <hi>Sign of the Croſs in token, that hereafter he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſs the Faith Chriſt of Crucifi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d,</hi> &amp;c. We ſhould be accus'd as introducing a <hi>new Sacrament,</hi> or adding the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Croſs to <hi>that</hi> of Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>But then, they tell us ſecondly, we ſeem to own it our ſelves, when in an entire Repreſentative of <hi>our Church</hi> (ſuch as we ſuppoſe a <hi>Convocation</hi> to be) it is actually determin'd, that by the Sign of the Croſs, the Perſon Baptiz'd <hi>is dedicated to the ſervice of him that dy'd upon the Croſs;</hi> and <hi>what can be more immediate</hi> (ſaith one of our Brethren) <hi>than in the preſent dedicating act to uſe the ſign, and expreſs the dedicating Signification?</hi> It is confeſt that the <hi>30th. Canon</hi> doth ſay the <hi>Croſs is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable badg, whereby the Infant is dedicated,</hi> &amp;c. And the ſtreſs of the Objection in this part of it lieth in the word <hi>dedicated</hi> that is, becauſe the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is it ſelf a Seal of <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into Covenant, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> to God, and the Chriſtian Religion; therefore, by uſing a Symbolical Ceremony of humane inſtitution, whereby we profeſs the Perſon Baptiz'd, <hi>dedicated to the ſervice of him that dy'd upon the Croſs,</hi> we have made a <hi>new Sacrament,</hi> and added to <hi>that</hi> of Baptiſm, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him in our own <hi>invented</hi> way as Chriſt hath in that which he hath <hi>inſtituted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:578"/>
                        <p n="1">1. To this I anſwer, that ſurely the word <hi>dedication;</hi> is of a much larger Signification, than that it ſhould be confin'd meerly to the Interpretation, that <hi>our Brethren</hi> would put upon it. The meaning of <hi>dedication</hi> properly is, <hi>the appropriating of any thing or Perſon to any peculiar ſervice,</hi> ſuch as a Church, or Temple for the Worſhip of God: any Perſon to the profeſſion the true Religion, to the Miniſtry, or to any kind of attendance at the Holy Altars. This is the ſtricteſt ſenſe of <hi>dedication;</hi> but then, in a larger ſenſe we may ſuppoſe it apply'd to any ſtrict or conſcientious diſcharge of all the Duties, and anſwering all the ends of the <hi>firſt dedication.</hi> Thus, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Man ordain'd to the Miniſtry, whereby he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>dedicated</hi> to the work and ſervice of the Goſpel; he may by ſome ſolemn act of his own, <hi>dedicate</hi> himſelf to a zealous and faithful diſcharge of <hi>that Office;</hi> and this, after ſome time that he may have apprehended himſelf <hi>hitherto</hi> not ſo diligent in the truſt that had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him. This cannot be call'd in any ſenſe a new ordination; but it may with reaſon and <hi>ſenſe</hi> enough be ſtil'd a <hi>dedicating</hi> of a Man's ſelf more particularly to the ſervice of God, in the diſcharge of that Miniſtry he was ordain'd to. And therefore,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In this ſenſe the Convocation ought in all juſtice to be underſtood, when they, in explaining the intention of the Croſs, tell us, <hi>it is an honourable badg whereby the Infant is dedicated to the ſervice of him that dy'd upon the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And yet, I muſt needs ſay, it ſeems hard meaſure upon the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that if thoſe in a <hi>Convocation</hi> ſhould not have apply'd the word <hi>dedication,</hi> to what might be moſt ſtrictly the ſenſe of it, that this ſhould be ſo ſeverely expounded, that no other declarations of their meaning and intention muſt be accepted of, than what meerly the ſtrict and critical ſenſe of <hi>that</hi> word
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:578"/> will bear. Surely there are many expreſſions in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that may ſeem more diſtant from that ſenſe we are willing to take them in; and we ſhould be very loth to yield them up as the Authors or Defenders of ſome dangerous Opinions in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> becauſe ſome phraſes of theirs in the rigour of them, may be preſt to a kind of meaning that may ſeem to favour <hi>them.</hi> There is a neceſſary allowance to be given to ſome ſchemes of Speech, and meaning of words, or elſe we ſhould be in a perpetual wrangle and diſpute about them.</p>
                        <p>However, there doth not need even this ſort of Charity for this word <hi>dedicated,</hi> upon which ſuch weight of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been lay'd. For, as in all Authors it hath been variouſly uſed, ſo is it properly enough apply'd in <hi>this Canon,</hi> for the deſign for which it was uſed; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is plain and intelligible enough to the candid and unprejudic'd mind. The word <hi>dedication</hi> (as they uſe it) may properly enough ſignifie a <hi>Confirmation</hi> of our firſt <hi>dedication</hi> to God in Baptiſm, and a declaration of what the Church thinks of the Perſon Baptiz'd, what ſhe doth expect from him, and what Obligations he lieth under by his Baptiſm. And as a <hi>medium</hi> of this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſign of the Croſs is made, being as expreſſive as ſo many words, what the Infant by his Baptiſm was deſign'd to; the Apoſtle himſelf having comprehended the <hi>whole of Chriſtianity</hi> under that term and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Croſs.</hi> Now that our Church did deſign this <hi>declarative dedication</hi> (by the uſe of this ſign) and none other, is very evident, in that, though the word <hi>dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> is uſed in the explication of their ſenſe in <hi>that Canon,</hi> yet, do they there refer to the words uſed in the <hi>Book of Common Prayer.</hi> By comparing therefore the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Office for Baptiſm</hi> together (the <hi>Canon</hi> directing to the <hi>Office,</hi> and the <hi>Rubrick</hi> belonging to the <hi>Office</hi> directing to the Canon) we may obſerve what ſtreſs is to be lai'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:579"/> the word <hi>Dedicated</hi> that is, how far they were from deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>gning the ſame ſort of <hi>immediate dedication</hi> that is made by Baptiſm, and yet how by <hi>the Croſs,</hi> we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough be ſaid to be <hi>dedicated</hi> too.</p>
                        <p>As to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, we are all agreed that by <hi>that</hi> we are <hi>dedicated</hi> to the Service of Chriſt, and the Profeſſion of his Goſpel; Now the <hi>Church of England,</hi> both in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> do affirm and own, that the Baptiſm is complete, and the Child made a Member of Chriſt's Church, before the Sign of the Croſs is made uſe of; or if upon occaſion it ſhould not be made uſe of at all. It is expreſly ſaid, <hi>We receive this Child into the Congregation of Chriſt's Flock,</hi> and upon that, <hi>do ſign it with the Croſs.</hi> So that the Child is declar'd <hi>within the Congregation of Chriſt's Flock,</hi> before the Sign of the Croſs be apply'd to it. Beſide, that <hi>in the Office for private Baptiſm,</hi> where the Sign of the Croſs is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, we are directed <hi>not to doubt, but that the Child ſo Baptiz'd is lawfully and ſufficiently Baptiz'd;</hi> the Canon confirming it, <hi>that the Infant Baptiz'd is, by vertue of Baptiſm, before it be ſign'd with the ſign of the Croſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Congregation of Chriſt's Flock, as a perfect Member thereof, and not by any power aſcribed unto the ſign of the Croſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If therefore, we be <hi>dedicated</hi> in Baptiſm, and the Baptiſm acknowledg'd complete and perfect, before or without the uſe of this Sign, the Church cannot be ſuppos'd ordaining ſo needleſs a repetition as this would be, to <hi>dedicate</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, &amp; then to <hi>dedicate</hi> by the Croſs again, but that which they expreſs by <hi>dedicated by the Croſs,</hi> muſt be ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinct from that <hi>dedication</hi> which is in Baptiſm; that is, the one is a ſign of <hi>dedication,</hi> the other is the <hi>dedication</hi> it ſelf, as diſtinct the one from the other, as the Sign of Admiſſion is from Admiſſion it ſelf, and a ſignification of a priviledg, is from an Inſtituted means of Grace. It
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:579"/> ſeems a thing decent and ſeaſonable enough, that when it hath pleas'd God to receive a perſon into his favour, and given him the Seal of it, that the Church ſhould give him <hi>the right hand of fellowſhip,</hi> ſolemnly declaring and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying he is receiv'd into her Communion, by giving him the Badg of our Common Religion. So that, this is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no other than a Declaration the Church makes of what the Perſon Baptiz'd is admitted to, what engagement he lies under when capable of making a viſible Profeſſion. It expreſſeth what hath been done in Baptiſm, which is indeed not a <hi>ſign of Dedication</hi> but Dedication it ſelf, (as I have already ſaid) as alſo the Croſs is not <hi>dedication</hi> itſelf, but a <hi>ſign</hi> of it. Which Declaration is therefore made in the name of the Church in the plural number, <hi>We Receive this Child into the Congregation of Chriſts Flock, and do ſign him with the ſign of the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas, in Baptiſm, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as the immediate agent of Chriſt, by whom he is Authoriz'd and Commiſſionated, in the ſingular number (as in his Name) pronounceth it, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to what is urg'd above, that <hi>nothing can be more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, than in the preſent dedicating act, to uſe the ſign, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the dedicating ſignification;</hi> they muſt know, it might have been <hi>more immediate,</hi> either to have plac'd this Sign before Baptiſm, or to have appointed ſome ſuch form of words, in applying it as the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth; or if it had been pretended to be of divine Inſtitution, and neceſſary to make the Sacrament of Baptiſm compleat and perfect.</p>
                        <p>And thus, I preſume, I have run through the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>diſſenting brethren</hi> as to this Caſe. Wherein, I hope, I have neither miſrepreſented their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, nor let paſs any material ſtrength in them, nor in replying to them, uſed any one provoking or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive word. Would they but read and weigh this and the other Diſcourſes of this kind, with the ſame calmneſs of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:580"/> temper, and ſtudy of mutual agreement, wherewith (I dare ſay) they have been written; I cannot think there would abide upon their Spirits ſo vehement a deſire for the removal of theſe things; but it might rather iſſue in a peaceable and happy cloſure in the uſe of what hath been made appear was ſo innocently taken up, and might with ſo much advantage, under the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſerious and good Men, be ſtill retained. I do not indeed think any of our Church ſo fond of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> particularly, but that, if the laying it aſide might turn to as great Edification in the Church, as the ſerious uſe of it might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to, our Governours would eaſily enough condeſcend to ſuch an overture.

                        <head>A PERSUASIVE TO FREQUENT COMMUNION.</head>
                        <p>MY deſign in this Argument, is from the Conſideration of the Nature of this Sacrament of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and of the perpetual Uſe of it to the end of the World, to awaken Men to a ſenſe of their Duty, and the great Obligation which lies upon them to the more frequent receiving of it. And there is the greater need to make men ſenſible of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this particular, becauſe in this laſt Age by the unwary Diſcourſes of ſome, concerning the Nature of this Sacrament, and the danger of receiving it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, ſuch doubts and fears have been raiſed in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:583"/> minds of Men as utterly to deter many, and in a great meaſure to diſcourage almoſt the generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from the uſe of it; to the great prejudice and danger of Mens Souls, and the viſible abatement of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety by the groſs neglect of ſo excellent a means of our growth and improvement in it; and to the mighty ſcandal of our Religion, by the general diſuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ſo plain and ſolemn an Inſtitution of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Saviour.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I ſhall take occaſion as briefly and clearly as I can to treat of theſe <hi>four</hi> Points.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of this Inſtitution; this the Apoſtle ſignifies when he ſaith, that <hi>by eating this</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note> 
                           <hi>Bread, and drinking this Cup, we do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the <hi>Obligation</hi> that lies upon all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to a frequent obſervance of this Inſtitution; this is ſignified in that Expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup:</hi> which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion conſidered and compared together with the practice of the Primitive Church, does imply an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon Chriſtians to the frequent receiving of this Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie the <hi>Objections</hi> and Scruples which have been raiſed in the Minds of Men, and particularly of many devout and ſincere Chriſtians, to their great diſcouragement from their receiving this Sacrament, at leaſt ſo frequently as they ought: which Objections are chiefly grounded upon what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27.</note>

                           <hi>is guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord:</hi> and <hi>doth eat</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> 
                           <hi>and drink damnation to himſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What <hi>Preparation</hi> of our ſelves is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in order to our worthy receiving of this Sacrament: which will give me occaſion to explain the Apoſtle's meaning in thoſe Words, <hi>But let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> 
                           <hi>and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">I. For the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of this Inſtitution, implyed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thoſe Words, <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lord's Death till he come;</hi> or the Words may be read <hi>imperatively</hi> and by way of Precept, <hi>ſhew ye forth the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> In the three <hi>verſes</hi> immediately before, the Apoſtle particularly declares the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, with the manner and circumſtances of it, as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not onely by the hands of the Apoſtles, but as the Words ſeem rather to intimate, by immediate Revelation from our Lord himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which I alſo delivered unto you: that the Lord Jeſus in the ſame night that he was betrayed took Bread, and when he had given Thanks he brake it, and ſaid, take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you; this doe in remembrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup when he had ſupped, ſaying, this Cup is the New Teſtament in my Bloud: this doe as often as ye ſhall drink it in remembrance of me.</hi> So that the Inſtitution is in theſe Words, <hi>this doe in remembrance of me.</hi> In which words our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Diſciples after his Death to repeat theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>eating the Bread,</hi> and of <hi>drinking of the Cup,</hi> by way of ſolemn Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:584"/> of him. Now whether this was to be done by them once onely, or oftner; and whether by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples onely, during their lives, or by all Chriſtians afterwards in all ſucceſſive Ages of the Church, is not ſo certain merely from the force of theſe Words, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> but what the Apoſtle adds puts the matter out of all doubt, that the Inſtitution of this Sacrament was intended for all Ages of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church; <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come:</hi> that is, untill the time of his ſecond coming, which will be at the end of the World. So that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was deſigned to be a ſtanding Commemoration of the Death and Paſſion of our Lord till he ſhould come to Judgment; and conſequently the Obligation that lies upon Chriſtians to the obſervation of it is perpetual, and ſhall never ceaſe to the end of the World.</p>
                        <p>So that it is a vain conceit and more dream of the <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> concerning the <hi>ſeculum Spiritûs Sancti, the Age</hi> and diſpenſation <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> when, as they ſuppoſe, all humane Teaching ſhall ceaſe, and all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances and Inſtitutions in Religion ſhall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and there ſhall be no farther uſe of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is very plain from the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> that Prayer, and outward Teaching, and the Uſe of the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were intended to continue among Chriſtians in all Ages. As for <hi>Prayer,</hi> (beſides our natural Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this duty, if there were no revealed Religion) we are by our Saviour particularly exhorted to <hi>watch and pray,</hi> with regard to the day of Judgment, and in conſideration of the uncertainty of the time when it ſhall be: And therefore this will always be a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon Chriſtians till the day of Judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is preſcribed as one of the beſt ways of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:584"/> for it. That <hi>outward Teaching</hi> likewiſe and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> were intended to be perpetual is no leſs plain, becauſe Chriſt hath expreſly promiſed to be with the Teachers of his Church in the uſe of theſe Ordinances to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go and diſciple all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: and lo I am with you always to the end of the World.</hi> Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the end of that particular Age, but to the end of the Goſpel Age, and the conſummation of all Ages, as the Phraſe clearly imports. And it is as plain from this <hi>Text,</hi> that the <hi>Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</hi> was intended for a perpetual Inſtitution in the Chriſtian Church, till the ſecond coming of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Judgment: Becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that by theſe Sacramental Signs the Death of Chriſt is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented and commemorated till he comes. <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me: For as oft as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if this be the End and Uſe of this Sacrament, to be a ſolemn remembrance of the Death and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of our Lord during his abſence from us, that is, till his coming to Judgment, then this Sacrament will never be out of date till the ſecond coming of our Lord. The conſideration whereof ſhould mightily ſtrengthen and encourage our Faith in the hope of Eternal Life ſo often as we partake of this Sacrament: ſince our Lord hath left it to us as a memorial of himſelf till he come to tranſlate his Church into Heaven, and as a ſure pledge that he will come again at the end of the World and inveſt us in that Glory which he is now gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prepare for us. So that as often as we approach the Table of the Lord, we ſhould comfort our ſelves with the thoughts of that bleſſed time when we ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:585"/> eat and drink with him in his Kingdom, and ſhall be admitted to the great Feaſt of the Lamb, and to eternal Communion with God the Judge of all, and with our bleſſed and glorified Redeemer and the holy Angels and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect.</p>
                        <p>And the ſame conſideration ſhould likewiſe make us afraid to receive this Sacrament unworthily, without due Preparation for it, and without worthy effects of it upon our Hearts and Lives. Becauſe of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sentence of condemnation which at the ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord ſhall be paſt upon thoſe, who by the profanation of this ſolemn Inſtitution trample under foot the ſon of God, and contemn the bloud of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; that Covenant of Grace and Mercy which God hath ratified with Mankind by the Bloud of his Son. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us that <hi>he that eateth and drinketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily is guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi> This indeed is ſpoken of temporal Judgment (as I ſhall ſhew in the latter part of this Diſcourſe,) but the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> likewiſe ſuppoſeth, that if theſe temporal Judgments had not their effect to bring men to Repentance, but they ſtill perſiſted in the Profanation of this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they ſhould at laſt <hi>be condemned with the World.</hi> For as he that partaketh worthily of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament confirms his intereſt in the promiſes of the Goſpel, and his Title to eternal Life; ſo he that receives this Sacrament unworthily, that is without due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and without fruits meet for it; nay, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, continues to live in ſin whilſt he commemorates the Death of Chriſt, <hi>who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> this man aggravates and ſeals his own Damnation, becauſe he is guilty of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, not onely by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it, but by renewing in ſome ſort the cauſe of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:585"/> his ſufferings, and as it were <hi>crucifying to himſelf afreſh the Lord of life and glory, and putting him to an open ſhame.</hi> And when the great Judge of the world ſhall appear and paſs final Sentence upon men, ſuch obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and impenitent wretches as could not be wrought upon by the remembrance of the deareſt love of their dying Lord, nor be engaged to leave their ſins by all the tyes and obligations of this holy Sacrament, ſhall have their portion with <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> with the <hi>chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who were the betrayers and murtherers of the Lord of life and glory; and ſhall be dealt withall as thoſe who are in ſome ſort <hi>guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord.</hi> Which ſevere threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ought not to diſcourage men from the Sacrament, but to deter all thoſe from their ſins who think of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themſelves to God by ſo ſolemn and holy a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. It is by no means a ſufficient Reaſon to make men to fly from the Sacrament, but certainly one of the moſt powerfull Arguments in the world to make men forſake their ſins; as I ſhall ſhew more fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>third</hi> head of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The <hi>Obligation</hi> that lyes upon all Chriſtians to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> the frequent obſervance and practice of this Inſtitution. For though it be not neceſſarily implyed in theſe Words, <hi>as oft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup;</hi> yet if we compare theſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> with the uſage and practice of Chriſtians at that Time, which was to communicate in this holy Sacrament ſo often as they ſolemnly met together to worſhip God, they plainly ſuppoſe and recommend to us the frequent uſe of this Sacrament, or rather imply an obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtians to embrace all opportunities of receiving it. For the ſenſe and meaning of any Law or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:586"/> is beſt underſtood by the general practice which follows immediately upon it.</p>
                        <p>And to convince men of their obligation hereunto, and to ingage them to a ſutable practice, I ſhall now endeavour with all the plainneſs and force of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I can: And ſo much the more, becauſe the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it among Chriſtians is grown ſo general, and a great many perſons from a ſuperſtitious awe and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this Sacrament are by degrees fallen into a profane neglect and contempt of it.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall briefly mention a <hi>threefold</hi> Obligation lying upon all Chriſtians to frequent Communion in this holy Sacrament; each of them ſufficient of it ſelf, but all of them together of the greateſt force imaginable to engage us hereunto.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We are obliged in point of <hi>indiſpenſable duty,</hi> and in obedience to a plain precept and moſt ſolemn inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our bleſſed Saviour that great <hi>Lawgiver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> calls him: He hath bid us <hi>doe this.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who declares nothing in this matter but what he tells us he <hi>received from the Lord,</hi> admoniſheth us to doe it <hi>often.</hi> Now for any man that profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian to live in the open and continued contempt or neglect of a plain Law and Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is utterly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with ſuch a profeſſion. To ſuch our Lord may ſay as he did to the <hi>Jews, Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and doe not the things which I ſay?</hi> How far the Ignorance of this inſtitution, or the miſtakes which men have been led into about it, may extenuate this neglect is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration. But after we know our Lord's will in this particular and have the Law plainly laid before us, there is no cloak for our ſin. For nothing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:586"/> can excuſe the willfull neglect of a plain Inſtitution from a downright contempt of our Saviour's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We are likewiſe obliged hereunto in point of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</hi> The benefits which we expect to be derived and aſſured to us by this Sacrament are all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the new Covenant, the forgiveneſs of our ſins, the grace and aſſiſtence of God's holy Spirit to enable us to perform the conditions of this Covenant required on our part; and the comforts of God's holy Spirit to encourage us in well-doing, and to ſupport us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſufferings; and the glorious reward of eternal life. So that in neglecting this Sacrament we neglect our own intereſt and happineſs, we forſake our own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and judge our ſelves unworthy of all the bleſſings of the Goſpel, and deprive our ſelves of one of the beſt means and advantages of confirming and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe bleſſings to us. So that if we had not a due ſenſe of our <hi>duty,</hi> the conſideration of our own <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> ſhould oblige us not to neglect ſo excellent and ſo effectual a means of promoting our own comfort and happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We are likewiſe particularly obliged in point of <hi>gratitude</hi> to the carefull obſervance of this Inſtitution. This was the particular thing our Lord gave in charge when he was going to lay down his life for us, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Men uſe religiouſly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the charge of a dying friend, and, unleſs it be very difficult and unreaſonable, to doe what he deſires: But this is the charge of our beſt friend (nay of the greateſt friend and benefactour of all mankind) when he was preparing himſelf to dye in our ſtead and to offer up himſelf a ſacrifice for us; to undergo the moſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:587"/> grievous pains and ſufferings for our ſakes, and to yield up himſelf to the worſt of temporal deaths that he might deliver us from the bitter pains of eternal death. And can we deny him any thing he asks of us who was going to doe all this for us? Can we deny him this? ſo little grievous and burthenſome in it ſelf, ſo infinitely beneficial to us? Had ſuch a friend, and in ſuch circumſtances, bid us doe ſome great thing would we not have done it? how much more when he hath onely ſaid, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> when he hath onely commended to us one of the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and delightfull Actions, as a fit repreſentation and memorial of his wonderfull love to us, and of his cruel ſufferings for our ſakes; when he hath onely enjoyned us, in a thankfull commemoration of his goodneſs, to meet at his Table and to remember what he hath done for us; to look upon him whom we have pierced, and to reſolve to grieve and wound him no more? Can we without the moſt horrible ingratitude neglect this dying charge of our Sovereign and our Saviour, the great friend and lover of ſouls? A command ſo reaſonable, ſo eaſie, ſo full of bleſſings and benefits to the faithfull obſervers of it!</p>
                        <p>One would think it were no difficult matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men of their duty in this particular, and of the neceſſity of obſerving ſo plain an Inſtitution of our Lord; that it were no hard thing to perſuade men to their intereſt, and to be willing to partake of thoſe great and manifold bleſſings which all Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be promiſed and made good to the frequent and worthy Receivers of this Sacrament. Where then lyes the difficulty? what ſhould be the cauſe of all this backwardneſs which we ſee in men to ſo plain, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſo beneficial a duty? The truth is, men have been greatly diſcouraged from this Sacrament
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:587"/> by the unwary preſſing and inculcating of two great truths; <hi>the danger of the unworthy receiving of this holy Sacrament, and the neceſſity of a due preparation for it.</hi> Which brings me to the</p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>Third</hi> Particular I propoſed, which was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> to ſatisfie the <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> which have been raiſed in the minds of men, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of many devout and ſincere Chriſtians, to their great diſcouragement from the receiving of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt ſo frequently as they ought. And theſe Objections, I told you, are chiefly grounded upon what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays at the 27th. <hi>verſe. Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord.</hi> And again <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>He that eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Upon the miſtake and miſapplication of theſe <hi>Texts</hi> have been grounded <hi>two</hi> Objections, of great force to diſcourage men from this Sacrament, which I ſhall endeavour with all the tenderneſs and clearneſs I can to remove. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the danger of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving being ſo very great, it ſeems the ſafeſt way not to receive at all. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſo much preparation and worthineſs being required in order to our worthy Receiving, the more timorous ſort of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians can never think themſelves duly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough qualified for ſo ſacred an Action.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the danger of unworthy receiving being ſo <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label> very great it ſeems the ſafeſt way wholly to refrain from this Sacrament and not to receive it at all. But this Objection is evidently of no force if there be (as moſt certainly there is) as great or a greater danger on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:588"/> the other hand, <hi>viz.</hi> in the neglect of this Duty: And ſo though the danger of unworthy receiving be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by not receiving, yet the danger of neglecting and contemning a plain Inſtitution of Chriſt is not thereby avoided. Surely they in the <hi>Parable</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to come to the <hi>marriage-feaſt</hi> of the <hi>King's Son</hi> and <hi>made light</hi> of that gracious invitation were at leaſt as faulty as he who came <hi>without a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And we find in the concluſion of the <hi>Parable,</hi> that as he was ſeverely puniſhed for his diſreſpect, ſo they were deſtroyed for their diſobedience. Nay of the two it is the greater ſign of contempt wholly to neglect the Sacrament, than to partake of it without ſome due qualification. The greateſt indiſpoſition that can be for this holy Sacrament is one's being a bad man, and he may be as bad, and is more likely to continue ſo, who wilfully neglects this Sacrament, than he that comes to it with any degree of reverence and preparation, though much leſs than he ought: And ſurely it is very hard for men to come to ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn an Ordinance without ſome kind of religious awe upon their ſpirits, and without ſome good thoughts and reſolutions, at leaſt for the preſent. If a man that lives in any known wickedneſs of life do before he receive the Sacrament ſet himſelf ſeriouſly to be humbled for his ſins, and to repent of them, and to beg God's grace and aſſiſtence againſt them; and after the receiving of it, does continue for ſome time in theſe good reſolutions, though after a while he may poſſibly relapſe into the ſame ſins again; this is ſome kind of reſtraint to a wicked life; and theſe good moods and fits of repentance and reformation are much better than a conſtant and uninterrupted courſe of ſin: Even this <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> which is but <hi>as the morning cloud and the early dew which ſo ſoon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away,</hi> is better than none.</p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:588"/>
                        <p>And indeed ſcarce any man can think of coming to the Sacrament, but he will by this conſideration be excited to ſome good purpoſes, and put upon ſome ſort of endeavour to amend and reform his life: and though he be very much under the bondage and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of evil habits, if he do with any competent degree of ſincerity (and it is his own fault if he do not) make uſe of this excellent means and inſtrument for the mortifying and ſubduing of his luſts and for the obtaining of God's grace and aſſiſtence, it may pleaſe God by the uſe of theſe means ſo to abate the force and power of his luſts, and to imprint ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon his mind in the receiving of this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and preparing himſelf for it, that he may at laſt break off his wicked courſe and become a good man.</p>
                        <p>But, on the other hand, as to thoſe who neglect this Sacrament, there is hardly any thing left to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from the greateſt enormities of life, and to give a check to them in their evil courſe: nothing but the penalty of humane Laws, which men may avoid and yet be wicked enough. Heretofore men uſed to be reſtrained from great and ſcandalous vices by ſhame and fear of diſgrace, and would abſtain from many ſins out of regard to their honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among men: But men have hardened their faces in this degenerate Age, and thoſe gentle reſtraints of modeſty which governed and kept men in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſignifie nothing now adays. Bluſhing is out of faſhion, and ſhame is ceaſed from among the children of men.</p>
                        <p>But the Sacrament did always uſe to lay ſome kind of reſtraint upon the worſt of men: and if it did not wholly reform them, it would at leaſt have ſome good effect upon them for a time: If it did not make men
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:589"/> good, yet it would make them reſolve to be ſo, and leave ſome good thoughts and impreſſions upon their minds.</p>
                        <p>So that I doubt not but it hath been a thing of very bad conſequence, to diſcourage men ſo much from the Sacrament, as the way hath been of late years: And that many men who were under ſome kind of check before, ſince they have been driven away from the Sacrament have quite let looſe the reins, and proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to all manner of impiety and vice. And among the many ill effects of our paſt confuſions, this is none of the leaſt, That in many Congregations of this Kingdom Chriſtians were generally diſuſed and deterred from the Sacrament, upon a pretence that they were unfit for it; and being ſo, they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily incur the danger of unworthy receiving; and therefore they had better wholly to abſtain from it. By which it came to paſs that in very many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this great and ſolemn Inſtitution of the Chriſtian Religion was almoſt quite forgotten, as if it had been no part of it; and the remembrance of Chriſt's death even loſt among Chriſtians: So that many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>England</hi> might juſtly have taken up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Woman at our Saviour's Sepulchre, <hi>they have taken away our Lord, and we know not where they have laid him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But ſurely men did not well conſider what they did, nor what the conſequences of it would be, when they did ſo earneſtly diſſuade men from the Sacrament. 'Tis true indeed the danger of unworthy receiving is great; but the proper inference and concluſion from hence is not that men ſhould upon this conſideration be deterred from the Sacrament, but that they ſhould be affrighted from their ſins, and from that wicked courſe of life which is an habitual indiſpoſition and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:589"/> unworthineſs. St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed (as I obſerved before) truly repreſents, and very much aggravates the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the unworthy receiving of this Sacrament; but he did not deter the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from it, becauſe they had ſometimes come to it without due reverence, but exhorts them to amend what had been amiſs and to come better prepared and diſpoſed for the future. And therefore after that terrible declaration in the Text, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord,</hi> he does not add, therefore let Chriſtians take heed of coming to the Sacrament, but, let them come prepared and with due reverence, not as to a common meal, but to a ſolemn participation of the body and bloud of Chriſt; <hi>but let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For, if this be a good reaſon to abſtain from the Sacrament, for fear of performing ſo ſacred an action in an undue manner, it were beſt for a bad man to lay aſide all Religion and to give over the exerciſe of all the duties of Piety, of prayer, of reading and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word of God; becauſe there is a propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable danger in the unworthy and unprofitable uſe of any of theſe. <hi>The prayer of the wicked</hi> (that is, of one that reſolves to continue ſo) <hi>is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives us the ſame caution concerning hearing the Word of God; <hi>take heed how ye hear.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that thoſe who are not reformed by the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it is <hi>the ſavour of death,</hi> that is deadly and damnable, to ſuch perſons.</p>
                        <p>But now will any man from hence argue, that it is beſt for a wicked man not to pray, not to hear or reade the Word of God, leſt by ſo doing he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:590"/> and aggravate his condemnation? And yet there is as much reaſon from this conſideration to perſuade men to give over praying and attending, to God's Word as to lay aſide the uſe of the Sacrament. And it is every whit as true that he that prays un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily and hears the Word of God unworthily, that is, without fruit and benefit, is guilty of a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and of our bleſſed Saviour; and by his indevout prayers and unfruitfull hearing of God's Word does further and aggravate his own damnation: I ſay, this is every whit as true, as that he that eats and drinks the Sacrament unworthily is guilty of a high contempt of Chriſt, and <hi>eats and drinks his own Judgment;</hi> ſo that the danger of the unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this ſo ſacred an action is no otherwiſe a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to any man to abſtain from the Sacrament, than it is an Argument to him to caſt off all Religion. He that unworthily uſeth or performs any part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in an evil and dangerous condition; but he that caſts off all Religion plungeth himſelf into a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſtate, and does certainly damn himſelf to avoid the danger of damnation: Becauſe he that caſts off all Religion throws off all the means whereby he ſhould be reclaimed and brought into a better ſtate. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more fitly illuſtrate this matter than by this plain Similitude: He that eats and drinks intemperately endangers his health and his life, but he that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this danger will not eat at all I need not tell you what will certainly become of him in a very ſhort ſpace.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome conſcientious perſons who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the Sacrament upon an apprehenſion that the ſins which they ſhall commit afterwards are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. But this is a great miſtake; our Saviour having ſo plainly declared that all manner of ſin ſhall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:590"/> be forgiven men except the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt; ſuch as was that of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who as our Saviour tells us blaſphemed the Holy Ghoſt in aſcribing thoſe great miracles which they ſaw him work, and which he really wrought by the Spirit of God, to the power of the Devil. Indeed to ſin deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately after ſo ſolemn an engagement to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a great aggravation of ſin, but not ſuch as to make it unpardonable. But the neglect of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the way to prevent theſe ſins; but, on the contrary, the conſtant receiving of it with the beſt preparation we can is one of the moſt effectual means to prevent ſin for the future, and to obtain the aſſiſtence of God's grace to that end: And if we fall into ſin afterwards, we may be renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; <hi>for we have an advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is the propitiation for our ſins;</hi> and as ſuch, is in a very lively and affecting manner exhibited to us in this bleſſed Sacrament of his body broken, and his bloud ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſins. Can we think that the primitive Chriſtians, who ſo frequently received this holy Sacrament, did never after the receiving of it fall into any deliberate ſin? undoubtedly many of them did; but far be it from us to think that ſuch ſins were unpardonable, and that ſo many good men ſhould becauſe of their carefull and conſcientious obſervance of our Lord's Inſtitution unavoidably fall into condemnation.</p>
                        <p>To draw to a concluſion: ſuch groundleſs fears and jealouſies as theſe may be a ſign of a good meaning, but they are certainly a ſign of an injudicious mind. For if we ſtand upon theſe Scruples, no man perhaps was ever ſo worthily prepared to draw near to God in any duty of Religion, but there was ſtill ſome defect or other in the diſpoſition of his mind, and the degree
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:591"/> of his preparation. But if we prepare our ſelves as well as we can, this is all God expects. And for our fears of falling into ſin afterwards, there is this plain anſwer to be given to it; that the danger of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin is not prevented by neglecting the Sacrament, but encreaſed: becauſe a powerfull and probable means of preſerving men from ſin is neglected. And why ſhould not every ſincere Chriſtian, by the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this Sacrament and renewing his Covenant with God, rather hope to be confirmed in goodneſs, and to receive farther aſſiſtences of God's grace and holy Spirit to ſtrengthen him againſt ſin, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to ſubdue it; than trouble himſelf with fears which are either without ground, or if they are not, are no ſufficient reaſon to keep any man from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? We cannot ſurely entertain ſo unworthy a thought of God and our bleſſed Saviour, as to imagine that he did inſtitute the Sacrament not for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Salvation, but as a ſnare, and an occaſion of our ruine and damnation. This were to pervert the gracious deſign of God, and turn the cup of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation into a cup of deadly poiſon to the ſouls of men.</p>
                        <p>All then that can reaſonably be inferred from the danger of unworthy receiving is, that upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration men ſhould be quickened to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with a due preparation of mind, and ſo much the more to fortifie their reſolutions of living ſutably to that holy Covenant which they ſolemnly renew every time they receive this holy Sacrament. This conſideration ought to convince us of the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a good life, but not to deter us from the uſe of any means which may contribute to make us good. Therefore (as a learned <hi>Divine</hi> ſays very well) this Sacrament can be neglected by none but thoſe that do
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:591"/> not underſtand it, but thoſe who are unwilling to be tyed to their duty and are afraid of being engaged to uſe their beſt diligence to keep the commandments of Chriſt: And ſuch perſons have no reaſon to fear being in a worſe condition, ſince they are already in ſo bad a ſtate. And thus much may ſuffice for anſwer to the <hi>firſt Objection</hi> concerning the great danger of unworthy receiving this holy Sacrament. I proceed to the</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Second Objection,</hi> which was this; That ſo much <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>2</label> preparation and worthineſs being required to our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving, the more timorous ſort of Chriſtians can never think themſelves duly enough qualified for ſo ſacred an Action.</p>
                        <p>For a full Anſwer to this Objection, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour briefly to clear theſe <hi>three</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That every degree of Imperfection in our preparation for this Sacrament is not a ſufficient reaſon for men to refrain from it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a total want of a due preparation, not onely in the degree but in the main and ſubſtance of it, though it render us unfit at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to receive this Sacrament, yet it does by no means excuſe our neglect of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the proper Inference and concluſion from the total want of a due preparation is not to caſt off all thoughts of receiving the Sacrament, but immediately to ſet upon the work of preparation that ſo we may be fit to receive it. And if I can clearly make out theſe <hi>three</hi> things I hope this Objection is fully anſwered.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That every degree of Imperfection in our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this Sacrament is not a ſufficient reaſon for men to abſtain from it: For then no man ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. For who is every way worthy and in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and reſpects duly qualified to approach the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:592"/> of God in any of the duties of his Worſhip and Service? Who can <hi>waſh his hands in innocency,</hi> that ſo he may be perfectly fit to approach God's Altar? <hi>There is not a man on earth that lives and ſins not.</hi> The Graces of the beſt men are imperfect; and every imperfection in grace and goodneſs is an imperfection in the diſpoſition and preparation of our minds for this holy Sacrament: But if we do heartily repent of our ſins, and ſincerely reſolve to obey and perform the terms of the Goſpel and of that Covenant which we entred into by Baptiſm and are going ſolemnly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and confirm by our receiving of this Sacrament, we are at leaſt in ſome degree and in the main quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to partake of this holy Sacrament; And the way for us to be more fit is to receive this Sacrament fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that by this ſpiritual food of God's appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by <hi>this living bread which comes down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> our ſouls may be nouriſhed in goodneſs, and new ſtrength and vertue may be continually derived to us for the purifying of our hearts and enabling us to run the ways of God's commandments with more conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and delight. For the way <hi>to grow in grace</hi> and to be <hi>ſtrengthned with all might in the inner man,</hi> and to <hi>abound in all the fruits of righteouſneſs which by Chriſt Jeſus are to the praiſe and glory of God,</hi> is with care and conſcience to uſe thoſe means which God hath appointed for this end: And if we will neglect the uſe of theſe means it is to no purpoſe for us to pray to God for his grace and aſſiſtence. We may tire our ſelves with our devotions and fill heaven with vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and yet by all this importunity obtain nothing at God's hand: Like lazy beggars that are always complaining and alway asking, but will not work, will doe nothing to help themſelves and better their condition; and therefore are never like to move the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:592"/> pity and compaſſion of others. If we expect God's grace and aſſiſtence, we muſt work out our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the carefull uſe of all thoſe means which God hath appointed to that end. That excellent degree of goodneſs which men would have to fit them for the Sacrament, is not to be had but by the uſe of it. And therefore it is a prepoſterous thing for men to inſiſt upon having the end before they will uſe the means that may further them in the obtaining of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The total want of a due preparation, not onely in the degree but in the main and ſubſtance of it, though it render us unfit at preſent to receive this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet does it by no means excuſe our neglect of it. One fault may draw on another, but can never excuſe it. It is our great fault that we are wholly unprepared, and no man can claim any benefit by his fault, or plead it in excuſe or extenuation of it. A total want of preparation and an abſolute unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is Impenitency in an evil courſe, a reſolution to continue a bad man, not to quit his luſts and to break off that wicked courſe he hath lived in: But is this any excuſe for the neglect of our duty that we will not fit our ſelves for the doing of it with benefit and advantage to our ſelves? A father commands his ſon to ask him bleſſing every day, and is ready to give it him; but ſo long as he is undutifull to him in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions, and lives in open diſobedience, forbids him to come in his ſight. He excuſeth himſelf from asking his father bleſſing becauſe he is undutifull in other things, and reſolves to continue ſo. This is juſt the caſe of neglecting the duty God requires, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he offers to us in the Sacrament, becauſe we have made our ſelves incapable of ſo performing the one as to receive the other; and are reſolved to continue ſo.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:593"/> We will not doe our duty in other things, and then plead that we are unfit and unworthy to doe it in this particular of the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The proper Inference and concluſion from a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal want of due preparation for the Sacrament is not to caſt off all thoughts of receiving it, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſet about the work of preparation, that ſo we may be fit to receive it. For if this be true, that they who are abſolutely unprepared ought not to receive the Sacrament, nor can do it with any benefit; nay by doing it in ſuch a manner render their condition much worſe, this is a moſt forcible argument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of life: There is nothing reaſonable in this caſe but immediately to reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a better courſe that ſo we may be meet partakers of thoſe holy Myſteries, and may no longer provoke God's wrath againſt us by the wilfull neglect of ſo great and neceſſary a duty of the Chriſtian Religion. And we do wilfully neglect it, ſo long as we do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſe to fit and qualifie our ſelves for the due and worthy performance of it. Let us view the thing in a like caſe; A Pardon is graciouſly offered to a rebel, he declines to accept it, and modeſtly excuſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf becauſe he is not worthy of it. And why is he not worthy? becauſe he reſolves to be a rebel, and then his pardon will do him no good, but be an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his crime. Very true: and it will be no leſs an aggravation that he refuſeth it for ſuch a reaſon, and under a pretence of modeſty does the impudenteſt thing in the world. This is juſt the caſe; and in this caſe there is but one thing reaſonable to be done, and that is, for a man to make himſelf capable of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit as ſoon as he can, and thankfully to accept of it: But to excuſe himſelf from accepting of the benefit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:593"/> offered, becauſe he is not worthy of it nor fit for it, nor ever intends to be ſo, is as if a man ſhould deſire to be excuſed from being happy becauſe he is reſolved to play the fool and to be miſerable. So that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our want of preparation be total, or onely to ſome degree, it is every way unreaſonable: If it be in the degree onely, it ought not to hinder us from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament; If it be total, it ought to put us immediately upon removing the impediment, by making ſuch preparation as is neceſſary to the due and worthy receiving of it. And this brings me to the</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt thing I propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> What preparation of our ſelves is neceſſary in order to the worthy receiving of this Sacrament. Which I told you would give me occaſion to explain the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s meaning in the laſt part of the <hi>Text, But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi> I think it very clear from the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and circumſtances of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacrament that he does not intend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our ſtate, whether we be Chriſtians or not, and ſincerely reſolved to continue ſo; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he does not here ſpeak of our habitual preparation by the reſolution of a good life. This he takes for granted, that they were Chriſtians and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to continue and perſevere in their Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: But he ſpeaks of their actual fitneſs and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs at that time when they came to receive the Lord's Supper. And for the clearing of this matter, we muſt conſider what it was that gave occaſion to this diſcourſe. At the 20th. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> he ſharply reproves their irreverent and unſutable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage at the Lord's Supper. They came to it very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:594"/> 
                           <hi>one before another.</hi> It was the cuſtome of Chriſtians to meet at their <hi>Feaſt of Charity,</hi> in which they did communicate with great ſobriety and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and when that was ended they celebrated the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Now among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> this order was broken: The rich met and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the poor from this common Feaſt. And after an irregular feaſt (one before another eating his own ſupper as he came) they went to the Sacrament in great diſorder; <hi>one was hungry</hi> having eaten nothing at all, <hi>others were drunk,</hi> having eaten intemperately, and the poor were deſpiſed and neglected. This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> condemns as a great profanation of that ſolemn Inſtitution of the Sacrament; at the participation whereof they behaved themſelves with as little reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as if they had been met at a common ſupper or feaſt. And this he calls <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's body,</hi> making no difference in their behaviour between the Sacrament and a common meal: which irreverent and contemptuous carriage of theirs he calls <hi>eating and drinking unworthily:</hi> for which he pronounceth them <hi>guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord,</hi> which were repreſented and commemorated in their <hi>eating of that bread and drinking of that cup.</hi> By which irreverent and contemptuous uſage of the body and bloud of our Lord, he tells them that they did incur the judgment of God; which he calls <hi>eating and drinking their own judgment.</hi> For that the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which our <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatours</hi> render <hi>damnation,</hi> does not here ſignifie eternal condemnation, but a temporal judgment and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in order to the prevention of eternal condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is evident from what follows; <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himſelf:</hi> And then he ſays, <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep:</hi> That is,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:594"/> for this irreverence of theirs God had ſent among them ſeveral diſeaſes, of which many had dyed. And then he adds, <hi>For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged. If we would judge our ſelves;</hi> whether this be meant of the publick Cenſures of the Church, or our private cenſuring of our ſelves in order to our future amendment and reformation, is not certain. If of the latter, which I think moſt probable, then <hi>judging</hi> here is much the ſame with <hi>examining our ſelves, ver.</hi> 28. And then the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s meaning is, that if we would cenſure and examine our ſelves, ſo as to be more carefull for the future, we ſhould eſcape the judgment of God in theſe temporal puniſhments. <hi>But when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world. But when we are judged;</hi> that is, when by neglecting thus to judge our ſelves we provoke God to judge us; <hi>we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world;</hi> that is, he inflicts theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgments upon us to prevent our eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Which plainly ſhews, that the judgment here ſpoken of is not eternal condemnation. And then he concludes, <hi>Wherefore, my Brethren, when ye come together to eat tarry for one another. And if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto judgment:</hi> where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> plainly ſhews both what was the crime of unworthy receiving, and the puniſhment of it. Their crime was, their irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and diſorderly participation of the Sacrament; and their puniſhment was, thoſe temporal judgments which God inflicted upon them for this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Now this being, I think, very plain; we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to underſtand the precept of examination of our ſelves <hi>before we eat of that bread and drink of</hi>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:595"/> 
                           <hi>that cup. But let a man examine himſelf;</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well with himſelf what a ſacred Action he is going about, and what behaviour becomes him when he is celebrating this Sacrament inſtituted by our Lord in memorial of his body and bloud, that is, of his death and paſſion: And if heretofore he have been guilty of any diſorder and irreverence (ſuch as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here taxeth them withall) let him cenſure and <hi>judge himſelf</hi> for it, be ſenſible of and ſorry for his fault, and be carefull to avoid it for the future; and having thus <hi>examined himſelf, let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi> This, I think, is the plain ſenſe of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe; and that if we attend to the ſcope and circumſtances of it, it cannot well have any other meaning.</p>
                        <p>But ſome will ſay, Is this all the preparation that is required to our worthy receiving of the Sacrament, that we take care not to come drunk to it, nor to be guilty of any irreverence and diſorder in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it? I anſwer in ſhort, this was the particular unworthineſs with which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> taxeth the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians;</hi> and which he warns them to amend, as they deſire to eſcape the judgments of God, ſuch as they had already felt for this irreverent carriage of theirs, ſo unſutable to the holy Sacrament: He finds no other fault with them at preſent in this matter, though any other ſort of irreverence will proportionably expoſe men to the like puniſhment. He ſays nothing here of their habitual preparation, by the ſincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolution of a good life anſwerable to the rules of the Chriſtian Religion: This we may ſuppoſe he took for granted. However, it concerns the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament no more than it does Prayer or any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duty. Not but that it is very true that none but thoſe who do heartily embrace the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:595"/> and are ſincerely reſolved to frame their lives according to the holy rules and precepts of it, are fit to communicate in this ſolemn acknowledgment and profeſſion of it. So that it is a practice very much to be countenanced and encouraged, becauſe it is of great uſe, for Chriſtians by way of preparation for the Sacrament to examine themſelves in a larger ſenſe than in all probability the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: I mean, to examine our paſt lives and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them in order to a ſincere repentance of all our errours and miſcarriages, and to fix us in the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy purpoſe and reſolution of a better life: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when we expect to have the forgiveneſs of our ſins ſealed to us, we ſhould lay aſide all enmity and thoughts of revenge, and heartily forgive thoſe that have offended us, and put in practice that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal love and charity which is repreſented to us by this holy Communion. And to this purpoſe we are earneſtly exhorted in the publick <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> by way of due preparation and diſpoſition for it, to <hi>repent us truly of our ſins paſt, to amend our lives and to be in perfect charity with all men, that ſo we may be meet partakers of thoſe holy myſteries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And becauſe this work of examining our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſtate and condition, and of exerciſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God and charity towards men is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us as we are Chriſtians, and can never be put in practice more ſeaſonably and with greater advantage than when we are meditating of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore beſides our habitual preparation by repentance and the conſtant endeavours of a holy life, it is a very pious and commendable cuſtome in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians before their coming to the Sacrament to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſome particular time for this work of examination. But how much time every perſon ſhould allot to this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:596"/> purpoſe, is matter of prudence; and as it need not, ſo neither indeed can it be preciſely determined. Some have greater reaſon to ſpend more time upon this work, than others; I mean thoſe whoſe accounts are heavier becauſe they have long run upon the ſcore and neglected themſelves: And ſome alſo have more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and freedom for it, by reaſon of their eaſie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſtances in the world; and therefore are obliged to allow a greater portion of time for the exerciſes of piety and devotion. In general, no man ought to doe a work of ſo great moment and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſlightly and perfunctorily. And in this, as in all other actions, the end is principally to be regarded. Now the end of examining our ſelves is to underſtand our ſtate and condition, and to reform whatever we find amiſs in our ſelves. And provided this end be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the circumſtances of the means are leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: whether more or leſs time be allowed to this work it matters not ſo much, as to make ſure that the work be throughly done.</p>
                        <p>And I do on purpoſe ſpeak thus cautiouſly in this matter, becauſe ſome pious perſons do perhaps err on the ſtricter hand, and are a little ſuperſtitious on that ſide; inſomuch that unleſs they can gain ſo much time to ſet apart for a ſolemn preparation, they will refrain from the Sacrament at that time, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they be habitually prepared. This I doubt not proceeds from a pious mind; but as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays in another caſe about the Sacrament, <hi>ſhall I praiſe them in this? I praiſe them not.</hi> For, provided there be no wilfull neglect of due preparation, it is much better to come ſo prepared as we can, nay I think it is our duty ſo to doe, rather than to abſtain upon this <hi>puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</hi> For when all is done, the beſt preparation for the Sacrament is the general care and endeavour of a good
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:596"/> life: And he that is thus prepared may receive at any time when opportunity is offered, though he had no particular foreſight of that opportunity. And I think in that caſe ſuch a one ſhall doe much better to receive than to refrain; becauſe he is habitually prepared for the Sacrament, though he had no time to make ſuch actual preparation as he deſired. And if this were not allowable how could Miniſters communicate with ſick perſons at all times, or perſuade others to doe it many times upon very ſhort and ſudden warning?</p>
                        <p>And indeed we cannot imagine that the primitive Chriſtians, who received the Sacrament ſo frequently that for ought appears to the contrary they judged it as eſſential and neceſſary a part of their publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as any other part of it whatſoever, even as their Hymns and Prayers, and reading and interpreting the Word of God: I ſay, we cannot well conceive how they who celebrated it ſo conſtantly, could allot any more time for a ſolemn preparation for it, than they did for any other part of divine worſhip: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> when he bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> examine themſelves could mean no more than that conſidering the nature and ends of this Inſtitution they ſhould come to it with great reverence; and reflecting upon their former miſcarriages in this matter, ſhould be carefull upon this admonition to avoid them for the future and to amend what had been amiſs: which to doe, requires rather reſolution and care than any long time of preparation.</p>
                        <p>I ſpeak this, that devout perſons may not be entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in an apprehenſion of a greater neceſſity than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there is of a long and ſolemn preparation every time they receive the Sacrament. The great neceſſity that lies upon men is to live as becomes Chriſtians, and then they can never be abſolutely unprepared.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:597"/> Nay, I think this to be a very good preparation; and I ſee not why men ſhould not be very well ſatisfied with it, unleſs they intend to make the ſame uſe of the Sacrament that many of the Papiſts do of Confeſſion and Abſolution, which is to quit with God once or twice a year, that ſo they may begin to ſin again upon a new ſcore.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the Examination of our ſelves is a thing ſo very uſefull, and the time which men are wont to ſet apart for their preparation for the Sacrament is ſo advantageous an opportunity for the practice of it; therefore I cannot but very much commend thoſe who take this occaſion to ſearch and try their ways, and to call themſelves to a more ſolemn account of their actions. Becauſe this ought to be done ſometime, and I know no fitter time for it than this. And perhaps ſome would never find time to recollect themſelves and to take the condition of their ſouls into ſerious conſideration, were it not upon this ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>The ſum of what I have ſaid is this, that ſuppoſing a perſon to be habitually prepared by a religious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind and the general courſe of a good life, this more ſolemn actual preparation is not always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: And it is better when there is an opportunity to receive without it, than not to receive at all. But the greater our actual preparation is, the better. For no man can examine himſelf too often, and underſtand the ſtate of his ſoul too well, and exerciſe repentance, and renew the reſolutions of a good life too frequently. And there is perhaps no fitter opportunity for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this, than when we approach the Lord's table, there to commemorate his death and to renew our Covenant with him to live as becomes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:597"/>
                        <p>All the Reflexion I ſhall now make upon this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhall be from the conſideration of what hath been ſaid earneſtly to excite all that profeſs and call themſelves Chriſtians to a due preparation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for this holy Sacrament, and a frequent partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of it according to the intention of our Lord and Saviour in the inſtitution of it, and the undoubted practice of Chriſtians in the primitive and beſt times, when men had more devotion and fewer ſcruples about their duty.</p>
                        <p>If we do in good earneſt believe that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inſtituted by our Lord in remembrance of his dying love, we cannot but have a very high value and eſteem for it upon that account. Methinks ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we reade in the inſtitution of it thoſe words of our dear Lord, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> and conſider what he who ſaid them did for us, this dying charge of our beſt friend ſhould ſtick with us and make a ſtrong impreſſion upon our minds; Eſpecially if we add to theſe, thoſe other words of his not long before his death, <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friend; ye are my friends if ye doe whatſoever I command you.</hi> It is a wonderfull love which he hath expreſſed to us, and worthy to be had in perpetual remembrance. And all that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from us, by way of thankfull acknowledgment, is to celebrate the remembrance of it by the frequent participation of this bleſſed Sacrament. And ſhall this charge, laid upon us by him who laid down his life for us, lay no obligation upon us to the ſolemn remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that unparallel'd kindneſs which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſo many bleſſings and benefits to us? It is a ſign we have no great ſenſe of the benefit when we are ſo unmindfull of our benefactour as to forget him days
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:598"/> without number. The Obligation he hath laid upon us is ſo vaſtly great, not onely beyond all requital but beyond all expreſſion, that if he had commanded us ſome very grievous thing we ought with all the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and chearfulneſs in the world to have done it; how much more when he hath impoſed upon us ſo eaſie a commandment, a thing of no burthen but of immenſe benefit? when he hath onely ſaid to us, <hi>Eat O friends, and drink O beloved?</hi> when he onely invites us to his table, to the beſt and moſt delicious Feaſt that we can partake of on this ſide heaven?</p>
                        <p>If we ſeriouſly believe the great bleſſings which are there exhibited to us and ready to be conferred upon us, we ſhould be ſo far from neglecting them, that we ſhould heartily thank God for every opportunity he offers to us of being made partakers of ſuch benefits. When ſuch a price is put into our hands, ſhall we want hearts to make uſe of it? Methinks we ſhould long with <hi>David</hi> (who ſaw but the ſhadow of theſe bleſſings) to be ſatisfied with the good things of God's houſe, and to draw near his altar; and ſhould cry out with him, <hi>O when ſhall I come and appear before thee! My ſoul longeth, ye even fainteth for the courts of the Lord, and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> And if we had a juſt eſteem of things, we ſhould account it the greateſt infelicity and judgment in the world to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred of this privilege, which yet we do deliberately and frequently deprive our ſelves of.</p>
                        <p>We exclaim againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with great impatience, and with a very juſt indignation, for rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the People of half of this bleſſed Sacrament, and taking from them the <hi>cup of bleſſing, the cup of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> and yet we can patiently endure for ſome months, nay years, to exclude our ſelves wholly from it. If no ſuch great benefits and bleſſings belong to it,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:598"/> why do we complain of them for hindring us of any part of it? But if there do, why do we by our own neglect deprive our ſelves of the whole?</p>
                        <p>In vain do we bemoan the decay of our graces and our ſlow progreſs and improvement in Chriſtianity, whilſt we wilfully deſpiſe the beſt means of our growth in goodneſs. Well do we deſerve that God ſhould ſend leanneſs into our ſouls, and make them to conſume and pine away in perpetual doubting and trouble, if, when God himſelf doth ſpread ſo bountifull a Table for us and ſet before us the bread of life, we will not come and feed upon it with joy and thankfulneſs.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Whether Kneeling in the Act of Receiving the Holy Sacrament according to the Law of the Land, be not contrary to ſome expreſs Law of Chriſt obliging to the obſervance of a different Poſture?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Whether Kneeling be not a deviation from that example which our Lord ſet us at the firſt Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:602"/> and Repugnant to the nature of the Sacrament, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Table-Geſture?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Whether Kneeling Commanded in the Church of <hi>England</hi> be not contrary to the general Practice of the Church of Chriſt in the firſt and pureſt Ages?</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Whether it be Unlawful for us to receive Kneeling becauſe this Geſture was firſt introduced by Idolaters, and is ſtill notoriouſly abuſed by the Papiſts to Idolatrous ends and purpoſes.</p>
                           <p>1. Whether Kneeling in the Act of Receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in Obedience to the Law of the Land, be not a Tranſgreſſion againſt ſome expreſs Law of Chriſt which obliges us to obſerve another Geſture?</p>
                           <p>For ſatisfaction in this Point, our onely recourſe muſt be to the Holy Scriptures contained in the Books of the New Teſtament, wherein the whole body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws delivered and enacted by our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, are collected and recorded by the Holy Ghoſt. And if there be any Command there extant concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſe of any particular Geſture in the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lord's Supper, we ſhall upon a diligent enquiry be ſure to find it. But before I give in my Anſwer, I readily grant thus much by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. Whatſoever is enjoyned and appointed by God to be prepetually uſed by all Chriſtians throughout all Ages without any alteration, that can never be nullified or altered by any Earthly Power or Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. When once the Supreme Lawgiver and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World hath any ways ſignified and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſuch and ſuch poſitive Laws ſhall be perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unalterably obſerved, then thoſe Laws (though in their own nature and with reſpect to the ſubject matter of them they be changeable) muſt remain in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:602"/> full Force, and can admit of no Change from the Laws of Men. It would be a piece of intolerable Pride, and the moſt daring Preſumption, for any Earthly Prince, any Council, any Societie of Men whatſoever, to oppoſe the known Will of the Soveraign Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. In this Caſe nothing can take off the Force and Obligation of ſuch Laws, but the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authoritie which firſt paſſed them into Laws. Thus much being granted and premiſed, I return this Anſwer to the Queſtion propoſed.</p>
                           <p>God hath been ſo far from eſtabliſhing the unalterable uſe of any particular Geſture in the Act of Receiving, that among all the Sacred Records of his Will, there is not any expreſs Command to determine our practice one way or other. We are left perfectly at our libertie by God to uſe what comely Geſture we pleaſe, either Sitting, Kneeling, or Standing. And if the Law of the <note place="margin">See <hi>the Caſe of Indifferent things.</hi>
                              </note> Land did not reſtrain our libertie, we might uſe any of the forementioned Geſtures, without the leaſt violation of any Law of God. This perhaps at firſt ſight may ſeem very ſtrange and falſe to many of our Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who have been taught to believe otherwiſe; and it may be (to judge Charitably) their Teachers and Paſtours have in this particular been impoſed on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the Writings and Aſſertions of other Men whoſe Perſons they have had in great admiration. But yet I am ſo ſecure of this Truth, that I challenge all the World to produce the Chapter and Verſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any Command is given for the uſe of any particular Geſture at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper. That Popiſh Principle of believing as the Church believes, and ſwallowing all for Goſpel which ſhe affirms to be ſo, though very miſchievous in its conſequence, is not ſo Popiſh, that is, ſo ill, as to pin our Faith on the Sleeves of particular Men, and relying barely on the word and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:603"/> credit of any one Man whom we highly eſteem, of what Party or Perſwaſion ſoever. For this is to create a Pope to our ſelves; and make every Man whom we phanſie infallible; this is to make two more than ſix, and the Authority of one Man outweigh the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, that is a Society of Men who are nothing near ſo liable to deception. I don't deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be truſted by any means in the matter under preſent conſideration; and therefore I would have the Reader to obſerve this Rule: Truſt no Mans Eyes or Judgment where you are able to uſe your own, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of the <hi>Bereans,</hi> ſo highly commended <note place="margin">Acts. 17. 11.</note> by St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this very account; that is, to make an ingenuous enquiry into the Truth of things, to ſearch the Scriptures whether theſe things be ſo as I ſay and aſſert. If this courſe were generally followed, it would go a great way towards the compoſing thoſe differences, and curing thoſe diviſions that at preſent are on foot amongſt us, occaſioned by ſeveral Tenets and Opinions about matters of Religion. By this means, a great many which paſs for Divine Oracles and Doctrines, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be no other than the whimſies and inventions of Men. With this cautionary advice I might fairly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs this Queſtion as being fully Anſwered, and leave all my Readers to diſprove me if they can.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe ſome may pretend they have not Leiſure, and others want of Skill, and others are not enduced with Patience enough to ſearch and examine this matter throughly as it ought, I will yield all the Charitable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance I am able towards their relief, by doing the work to their hands. My Buſineſs then at preſent is this, to Collect and Preſent to your view all thoſe places which relate to the Sacrament, and are moſt likely to inform us what our Lord by his Inſtitution and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath obliged us to. And certainly if there be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:603"/> any Command which tyes us up to the uſe of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Geſture, Sitting ſuppoſe or Standing, and not Kneeling, we ſhall find it in one or other of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, who give us a perfect Narrative of the whole Mind and Will of Chriſt in all matters neceſſary to Faith and Salvation: Let us therefore bring them under a ſtrict examination. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> gives this account of <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26.</note> the whole matter: <hi>As they were eating, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat; this is my Body. And he took the</hi>

                              <hi>Cup, and gave Thanks, and gave it to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Drink ye all of it. For this is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi>

                              <hi>which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins. But I</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> 
                              <hi>ſay unto you, I will not Drink henceforth of this Fruit of the Vine, until that day when I Drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom. And when they had Sung an Hymn,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Ver. 30.</note> 
                              <hi>they went out into the Mount of</hi> Olives. Much to the ſame purpoſe is the account which St. <hi>Mark</hi> gives of this matter.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And as they did eat, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed, and</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Mar. 14. 22.</note> 
                              <hi>brake it, and gave to them, and ſaid, Take, eat; this is my Body. And he took the Cup, and when he had given</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> 
                              <hi>Thanks, he gave it to them, and they all Drank of it. And he ſaid unto them, This is my Bloud of the New</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Ver. 24. Ver. 25.</note> 
                              <hi>Teſtament, which is ſhed for many. Verily I ſay unto you, I will Drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, until that day that I Drink it new in the Kingdom of God. And</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                              <hi>when they had Sung a Hymn, they went out into the Mount of</hi> Olives. And this is the ſum of what Saint <hi>Mark</hi> delivers concerning the Lord's Supper. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> with very little variation thus deſcribes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And he took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Luke 22. 19.</note> 
                              <hi>gave unto them, ſaying, This is my Body which is given for you; this do in Remembrance of me. Likewiſe alſo the</hi>

                              <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:604"/> 
                              <hi>Cup after Supper ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Bloud, which is ſhed for you.</hi> This Evangeliſt indeed makes mention of another Cup which our Lord took, and after he had bleſſed it, he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Take this, and divide it among your ſelves;</hi> and withal told them that he would not Drink of the Fruit of the Vine until the Kingdom of God ſhould come; which Cup plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the Paſſover, as will appear to any one who will conſult and compare the 15, 16, 17, and 18. Verſes of <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> on Mat. 26. 26. Horae Heb. &amp; Talmud.</note> the fore-mentioned Chapter; and is ſuppoſed to be that Cup wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to begin the Paſchal Feaſt, which they Bleſſed or Conſecrated in this Form of words: Bleſſed be God who Created the Fruit of the Vine. And whereas our Lord ſaith he will Drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, his meaning is, that he would never Celebrate the Feaſt of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with them any more after that time, but their next Feſtival Meeting ſhould be in Heaven: and this is very conſiſtent with our Lord's Drinking another Cup after this, which he Conſecrated to another uſe and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Sacrament, Ver. 20. And this is all the light this Divine Writer affords us concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rites and Ceremones which our Lord uſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, and eſtabliſhed for the uſe of all Chriſtians in all ſucceeding Ages.</p>
                           <p>As for St. <hi>John,</hi> he makes no mention at all of the Inſtitution of this Holy Feaſt by our Lord. All that can be collected from his Writings relates to the Paſſover, or, according to the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> to what paſt <note place="margin">John 13. from Ver. 1. to 31. vid. Hor. Heb. Tal. p. 300. and Mat. 26. 6.</note> between Chriſt and his Diſciples at a common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meal in <hi>Bethany,</hi> and that for this reaſon, among many others judiciouſly urged by him, becauſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples thought when our Lord had ſaid to him, Ver. 27. <hi>That thou doest do quickly,</hi> that he had given order to <hi>Judas</hi> who kept the bag, to buy thoſe things that they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:604"/> had need of againſt the Feaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſover; and therefore all thoſe paſſages, and that diſcourſe related by St. <hi>John</hi> in the foregoing Verſes of that Chapter, were tranſacted at an ordinary and common Supper. And indeed this ſeems to be the great end and deſign which St. <hi>John</hi> propoſed to himſelf in writing his Goſpel, and which throughout he conſtantly purſues, <hi>viz.</hi> To add out of his own Knowledge ſeveral remarkable paſſages (eſpecially ſuch as tend to demonſtrate the Divinity of our Saviour) as had been omitted by the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts in their Hiſtory of the Birth, Life, Actions and Sufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour. There is another paſſage in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, which in the Judgment of <note place="margin">John 5. 53.</note> many Learned Divines both Ancient and Modern, hath reſpect to the Lord's Supper, though not at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted when thoſe myſterious words were uttered by our Saviour.</p>

                              <hi>Drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> Now all that can be inferr'd from theſe words, as they relate to this Holy Feaſt, is onely thus much: that it's highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all Chriſtians (who have an opportunity to do it) to partake of the Lord's Supper, as they would partake in the merits of his Sacrifice, and the Efficacy of his Death and his Sufferings; and that none but ſuch as do receive the tokens and ſigns of his Body broken, and Blood ſhed for their Sins, ſhall be owned and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him as his Friends. Theſe are all the places that we meet with in the Goſpel; let us now ſee what is delivered in the <hi>Acts</hi> and other Writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Divinely-inſpired Authors. Among all their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:605"/> Writings there is but one place which gives any account of the Hiſtory of the Sacrament, and Inſtitution of it, and that is in the 1 Epiſt. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 11. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, that what he delivered to them, he received by immediate Revelation from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>viz.

                              <hi>he was betrayed, took Bread; and when he had given Thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you: this do in Remembrance of me. After the</hi>

                              <hi>ye eat this Bread, and Drink this Cup, ye do ſhew (or ſhew ye) the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places wherein the Holy Sacrament is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 16, 21. 1 Cor. 11. 20. Acts 2. 46. Acts 20. 7.</note> and deſcribed by ſeveral Names and Titles ſutable to the nature and ends of it, which for brevity ſake I omit, and deſire the Reader to conſult at his leiſure; and I would not put him to that trouble, if they did contain any thing that made againſt Kneeling, or that lookt like a command for the uſe of any other Geſture. Let us now look back a little upon the places forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and ſee what our Lord hath ordained and appointed to be of perpetual uſe in his Church.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Lord, at the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrament, were the Repreſentatives of the whole Church; and are to be conſidered under a double capacity. Either as Governours and Miniſters entruſted by Chriſt with the Power of diſpenſing and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacrament, or as ordinary and lay Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</p>
                           <p>If we conſider them as Governours and Stewards of the Myſteries, their Duty to which they are obliged by the expreſs command of their Lord, is to take the Bread into their Hands, to bleſs and conſecrate it to that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:605"/> myſterious and Divine uſe to which he deſigned it, to break it, to give it to the Communicants, as he gave it them: And ſo in like manner to Take the Cup, to bleſs it, to give it to their fellow-Chriſtians.</p>
                           <p>That which they were obliged to do by the command of our Lord, conſidered as private Men, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with all believers, was to take and receive the Conſecrated Elements of Bread and Wine, to eat and Drink, and to do all this in Commemoration of his wonderful Love in giving his Body to be broken and his Blood to be ſhed for the Sins of the World.</p>
                           <p>And what the leaſt Syllable or Shadow of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is there here in all this Hiſtory, for the uſe of any Geſture in the Act of Receiving? Since then the Holy Scripture is altogether ſilent as to this matter, its ſilence is a full and clear demonſtration that Kneeling is not repugnant to any expreſs Command of our Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Geſture was ever Commanded at all: And this hath been ingenuouſly Confeſſed in writing by a <note place="margin">A Manuſcript of an unknown Author, cited by Mr. <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,</hi> p. 48.</note> great Enemy to Kneeling, and a great Advocate for Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>That the Geſture of Sitting is but a matter of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not expreſly Commanded.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But the <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſters Aſſembled at <hi>Perth,</hi> affirm <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                              </label> that when our Lord at the Inſtitution Commanded his Diſciple to do this, he did by thoſe words Command them to uſe that Geſture which he uſed at that time, as well as to Take, Eat, Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Force of their Argument lies in this, if it have any force at all: Our Saviour Sate at the Paſſover, as the Scriptures plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 20. Mar. 14. 18. Luke 22. 14.</note> us; and it is to be ſuppoſed he continued in the ſame poſture when he inſtituted and Adminiſtred the Sacrament, which was at the cloſe of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: therefore <hi>Do this</hi> relates to, and includes the Geſture amongſt other things. But this is a miſerable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:606"/> ſhift, which tends to Sink rather than Support their Cauſe.</p>
                           <p>For firſt, If our Lord did Sit when he Adminiſtred <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>I</label> the Sacrament (which we will ſuppoſe at preſent) yet there is no reaſon in the World to incline us to think, that he intended by thoſe words, <hi>Do this,</hi> to oblige us to obſerve his Geſture onely, and not ſeveral other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which he obſerved at the ſame time. Since Chriſt hath not reſtrained and interpreted theſe words <hi>Do this</hi> ſo that they ſhould onely reſpect Sitting as he did, why ſhould we not think our ſelves obliged to do all that he did at the ſame time, as well as this? For example, If theſe words may be interpreted thus, <hi>Do this,</hi> that is, Sit as Chriſt did, why not thus alſo, <hi>Do this,</hi> that is, celebrate the Sacrament in an upper Room, in a private Houſe, late at night or the Evening, after a full Supper, <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 26. 20.</note> in the Company of 11 or 12 at moſt, <note place="margin">Mar. 14. 17. Luke 22. 14.</note> and they onely Men, with their Heads Covered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of thoſe Countries, and with unleavened Bread? There lyeth as great an Obligation upon all Chriſtians to obſerve all theſe Circumſtances in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord by vertue of theſe words, <hi>Do this,</hi> as there doth to Sit. So that this Argument violently recoils upon thoſe that urge it, and proves a great deal more than they are willing to have it. It concludes ſtrongly againſt their own Practices, and the liberty they take in omitting ſome things, and preſſing the neceſſary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of others, upon a reaſon which equally obliges to all.</p>
                           <p>But I deſire our Diſſenting Brethren (who may be <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>II</label> of the ſame Perſwaſion with theſe <hi>Scotch-men)</hi> to take this further conſideration along with them; which I think will turn the Scales, and make deep impreſſions upon tender Conſciences, and oblige them to obſerve moſt of the other Circumſtances which they omit,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:606"/> rather than this of Sitting, which they ſo earneſtly preſs and contend for. All thoſe forementioned Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances (except the two Laſt, which too are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed among Learned Men on all ſides) are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned in the Goſpel, and were without diſpute obſerved by Chriſt at the Inſtitution of the Sacrament: But the particular Geſture uſed by him at that time, is not expreſly mentioned; and what it was, is very diſputable and dubious, as I ſhall evince by and by under the ſecond Query.</p>
                           <p>How then can any Man think himſelf obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by the force of theſe words, <hi>Do this,</hi> to do what Chriſt is no where expreſly ſaid to do, and not obliged to do what the Scripture affirms he really did? Why that which is dark and dubious ſhould be made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule of Conſcience, and that which is plainly and evidently ſet down in Scripture ſhould have no force, nor be eſteemed any Rule at all: Theſe are Queſtions, I confeſs, beyond my capacity, and ſurpaſſing my skill to reſolve.</p>
                           <p>It's clear from St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the forecited place, that <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>III</label> thoſe words of our Lord, <hi>Do this,</hi> do reſpect onely the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23, 4, 5, 6, 27, 28. Verſes.</note> Bread and Wine, which ſignify the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and thoſe other actions there ſpecified by him, which are eſſential to the right and due celebration of that Holy Feaſt. For when it's ſaid, <hi>Do this in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me;</hi> and, <hi>This do ye as oft as ye Drink it in Remembrance of me;</hi> and, <hi>As oft as ye Eat this Bread, and Drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lords Death till he come;</hi> it's plain that <hi>Do this</hi> muſt be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sacramental Actions there mentioned, and not extended to the Geſture, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks not a word. Our Lord Inſtituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Remembrance of his Death and Paſſion, and not in Remembrance of his Geſture in Adminiſtring it:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:607"/> And conſequently, <hi>Do this</hi> is a general Command, obliging us onely to ſuch particular Actions and Rites as he had Inſtituted, and made neceſſary to be uſed in order to this great end, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignify and repreſent his Death, and that Bloudy Sacrifice which he offered to his Father, on the Croſs, for us miſerable Sinners. Upon the whole matter, I think, we may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is not a tittle of a Command in the whole New Teſtament to oblige us to receive the Lords Supper in any particular Poſture; and if any be ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, after all, as not to receive it in any other Geſture but what is expreſly Commanded, they muſt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as long as they live: And then I leave this to their ſerious conſideration, How they will be ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to excuſe their neglect of a known neceſſary duty (ſuch as receiving the Sacrament is) before God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who loved us ſo much as to ſend his Son to be a propitiation for our Sins: How they will ever Anſwer to their Crucified Saviour their Living and Dying in the breach of an expreſs Command of his given a little before his Paſſion to <hi>Do this in Remembrance of him,</hi> meerly becauſe the Geſture preſcribed by Authority was croſs to their private Wills and Phanſies, but not to the Mind and Will of God.</p>
                           <p>2. For the further proof and Confirmation of this Aſſertion, that there is no expreſs Command in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the uſe of any particular Geſture in the Act of receiving the Sacrament, I will appeal to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice of our Diſſenting Brethren, and all the Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. To begin with our Non-conforming Brethren. There are a great many Serious and Sincere-Hearted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:607"/> perſons among them, who profeſs that (were they left to their liberty, and not tyed up by the Law to Kneel at the Sacrament) they could with a ſafe Conſcience uſe that Geſture as well as any other. And they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell us, that they are willing and ready to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with us, provided we would Adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them either Sitting or Standing, that is, any way but that which is impoſed by Law. For the Rule by which they conduct their Conſciences in this matter, is this: Things in their own nature indifferent, which are no where Commanded or prohibited by God in Scripture, cannot, nor ought not to be reſtrained and limited by any Power or Authority of Man: And therefore all ſuch things which God left free for us to do or not to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin, become ſinful to us when impoſed by humane Authority. It's remote from my buſineſs to ſhew how weak and falſe a Principle this is, and of what miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous conſequences to the Peace of the Church; and for that reaſon I will paſs it by. But thus much may be inferr'd from this Tenent to my purpoſe, that they who hold and urge it as a reaſon why they cannot Receive Kneeling, which otherwiſe they could ſafely do, plainly own, that as to the Geſture, in the Act of receiving, it is in its own nature Indifferent, and left free by God for us to uſe or refuſe as we think fit, and by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that there is no expreſs Command given by God for the uſe of any particular Geſture. It could not be a matter of indifferency to our Diſſenting Brethren, whoſe Principle this is, if there were no Law of Man to Kneel at the Sacrament; and now there is ſuch a Law, it could not be Indifferent to them whether they received Sitting or Standing, as they profeſs it is, if there were any Law of God obliging to the uſe of any one Geſture whatſoever.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That there is no expreſs Command in Scripture
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:608"/> for any one Geſture in the Act of Receiving, may be inferr'd from the Judgment and Practice of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad: Whoſe Judgment and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will, I preſume, ſway much with thoſe who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church of <hi>England</hi> as not being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently purged from the Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as other Neighbour-Churches are, and who ſtood once engaged in a Solemn Covenant, to reform the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> according to the Word of God and the Pattern of the beſt Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
                           <p>Let us now compare the practice of our Church with the example of the Proteſtant Churches abroad, and ſee whether ſhe ought to reform the Geſture preſcribed at the Sacrament.</p>
                           <p>The Reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> and <hi>Helvetia</hi> Stand; the <hi>Dutch</hi> generally Sit; but in ſome places (as in <hi>Weſt-Frieſland)</hi> they Stand. The Churches of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, which ſpread through the large Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> through <hi>Norway,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony, Lithuany,</hi> and the Ducal Pruſſia in <hi>Poland,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſate of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſeveral other places and free Cities in that Empire, do for the moſt part, if not all of them, retain the Geſture of Kneeling. The <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches were reformed by <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who ſuffered Martyrdom at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> about the year 1416. long before <hi>Luthers</hi> time; and thoſe of the <hi>Augsburg</hi> or <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſions were founded and reformed by <hi>Luther,</hi> and were the firſt Proteſtants properly ſo called. Both theſe Churches, ſo early reformed, and of ſo large extent, did not only uſe the ſame Geſture that our Church enjoyns at the Sacrament, but they, together with thoſe of the <hi>Helvetick</hi> Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did in three general Synods unanimouſly condemn the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:608"/> Sitting Geſture (though they eſteemed it in it ſelf Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) <note place="margin">1 At Cracow, Anno. Dom. 1573. 2 Petricow or Peterkaw, 1578. 3 Wladiſlaw, 1583.</note> as being Scandalous, for this remarkable reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it was uſed by the <hi>Arrians</hi> (as their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods call the <hi>Socinians)</hi> in contempt of our Saviours Divinity; who therefore placed themſelves as Fellows with their Lord at his Table. And thereupon they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and exhort all Chriſtians of their Communion <hi>to change Sitting into Kneeling or Standing, both which Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies we Indifferently leave free according as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of any Church hath obtained, and we approve of their uſe without Scandal and Blame.</hi> Moreover they affirm, <hi>That theſe</hi> Socinians <hi>who deny Christ to be</hi> God, <hi>were the first that introduced Sitting at the Sacrament into their Churches, contrary to the Practice of all the Evangelical Churches in</hi> Europe. Among all theſe Forreign Churches of the Reformation, there is but one that I can find which uſeth Sitting, and forbids Kneeling, for fear of Bread-Worſhip: but yet in that Synod wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Kneeling, they left it to the choice of their Churches to uſe Standing, Sitting, or an Ambulatory Geſture (as the <hi>French</hi> do) and at laſt conclude thus: <note place="margin">Harmon. 4 Synods of Holl.</note> 
                              <hi>Theſe Articles are ſetled by mutual Conſent, that if the good of the Churches require it, they may and ought to be changed, augmented or diminiſhed.</hi> What now ſhould be the ground and reaſon of this variety both in Opinion and Practice touching the Geſture to be uſed at the Lords Supper? Is it to be ſuppoſed or imagined that an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Learned and Pious Divines, met together on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to conſult how to Reform their Churches according to the pure Word of God, ſhould through weakneſs and inadvertency overlook an expreſs Command of Chriſt for the perpetual uſe of any particular Geſture, if any ſuch there had been? Or ſhall we be ſo uncharitable as to think that all theſe eminent Churches wilfully paſt it by, and eſtabliſhed what was moſt agreeable to their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:609"/> own Phanſies, contrary to the known Will of God Would they have given liberty to all of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to uſe ſeveral Geſtures according to the cuſtom of their ſeveral Churches, if our Lord had tyed them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve but one? Would they declare (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Synod doth) that what they enjoyned might be altered, if the good of the Church ſo required, if ſo be Sitting had been expreſly Commanded by our Lord, to be uſed by all Chriſtians to the end of the World? No undoubtedly, they would not, we cannot either in reaſon or Charitie ſuppoſe it.</p>
                           <p>The true Principle upon which all theſe Reformed Churches built, and by which they are able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all this ſeeming difference in this matter, is the very ſame with that which the Church of <hi>England</hi> goes by in her Synods and Convocations, <hi>viz.</hi> That as to Rites and Ceremonies of an indifferent nature, every National Church hath Authoritie to inſtitute, change and aboliſh them, as they in Prudence and Charitie ſhall think moſt fit, and conducive to the ſetting forth God's Glory, the Edification of their People, and the Decent and Reverend Adminiſtration of the Holy Sacrament.

                           <p>Firſt, The particular Geſture uſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles at the Inſtitution and Celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can never be demonſtrated ſo as that the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may ſurely build upon it. This I ſhall endeavour to make good theſe two ways. Firſt, we have no ſure ground for it in Scripture. Secondly, the Cuſtoms ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the <hi>Jews</hi> render it very incertain and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. All that can be gathered from Scripture amounts <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26. Mar. 14. 22.</note> to no more than this, that as they were eating, or as they did eat, as the Phraſe is rendred in St. <hi>Mark, Jeſus took Bread and bleſſed, it and brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples; and he took the Cup (when he had Supped,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul; after Supper,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 25. Luke 22. 20.</note> it) <hi>and gave Thanks; and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it.</hi> Now it's very clear from this account which the Scripture gives, that our Lord did Inſtitute and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament to his Diſciples, and that they did Receive it: But whether Sitting, Kneeling, or Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is no where mentioned, nor plainly determined. It's clear that he Inſtituted this Holy Feaſt at the cloſe of the Paſchal Feaſt, for he took the Bread as they were Eating, and the Cup when he had Supped; that he did Celebrate the Paſſover according to the uſual manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe times, which was in a Diſcumbing <note place="margin">Luke 22. 14.

Yet whether, after all, the Apoſtles Received, or our Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred the Sacrament ſtill Sitting, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they did at the Paſſover, is not expreſt, nor can it be certainly concluded from the Word of God. The utmoſt ſtrength of their Argument who urge Sitting in imitation of our Saviours example, can ariſe to no more than this: That it's probable our Lord did not alter the Geſture he uſed at the Paſſover, when he Inſtituted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:610"/> the Sacrament. But who ſees not that a probability is far from a certainty! A thing may be really falſe, though it ſeem likely to be true: And that opinion which is ſpeculatively probable, may when reduced to practice become a great Sin and a great Error. Thus to refuſe to Receive the Holy Sacrament Kneeling, and thereby neglect a known neceſſary Duty, and not onely ſo, but to diſturb the Peace, and break the Unity of the Church, upon a bare probability that our Lord ſate, which we are not, cannot be ſure of, is a great fault in all who are guilty of it. For they appeal to an incertain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, againſt a plain certain Command, <hi>viz.</hi> to receive the Tokens and Pledges of our Saviours dying love, and <hi>to do this in Remembrance of him.</hi> They therefore who urge the example of Chriſt for Sitting at the Sacrament, and as a Plea againſt Kneeling, would do well firſt to make the example appear, and prove that he did Sit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preſs a Conformity.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If we conſult the Records of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Antiquities, and the Writings of Learned Men both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> concerning the Paſſover and the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> Celebrating it, we ſhall find that they did not keep to one and the ſame Geſture throughout the Solemnity. For the <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem Talmud, Maimonides</hi> and <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> do certifie us that they did alter their poſture at the Paſſover, though the Lying or Leaning poſture was generally and moſt Religiouſly uſed and obſerved at this Feaſt above any other.

For the reaſon of their Waſhing at all, and ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was, that no legal Impuritie or Uncleanneſs might cleave to them, and to ſignify the great care they took to keep this Solemn Feaſt Holy to the Lord. And as they were Nice and Curious in Purifying and Waſhing themſelves, ſo in keeping the Beds, Table, Diſhes, and <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Buxt</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoga, c. 12. p 286.</note> all other Utenſils neceſſary for this Feaſt, clean and free from all pollution too. To Waſh ſo often more than the Law required, and the general cuſtom of thoſe Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and hot Countries warranted, was a Phariſaical Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed by them; and, as ſuch, it's certain our Lord did not uſe it; but that he did Waſh ſometime before he Eat the Paſchal Supper, and after he had Sat down as the manner was, there is little reaſon to doubt: and all that I infer from hence is, that when he Waſhed, be it once or twice, he altered his poſture, and in all probabilitie either aroſe from his Bed and went <note place="margin">Vid. John 2. 6.</note> to the place where Water and Veſſels were prepared and ſet for ſuch uſes, or had Water brought to him in a Baſin, wherein he Waſhed either Sitting upright, or Standing; which are both different from that Geſture which was peculiar and proper to the Paſſover. St. <hi>John,</hi> in Chap. 13. 2, 4, 5. Verſes, will explain and Confirm this Cuſtom we are ſpeaking of. There he tells us how that <hi>Supper being ended</hi> (that is, in a manner or almoſt ended; for by comparing the 12 and 26 and 27 Verſes together, we ſhall find plainly that they had not quite finiſhed their Supper) <hi>Jeſus riſeth from Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and laid aſide his Garments, and took a Towel and girded himſelf; and after that poureth Water into</hi>

                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s cuſtom. To Waſh the Feet of the Gueſts was the Office of Servants, and it was altogether unuſual for the Maſter of the Feaſt to do; but our Lord, to ſet his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples an example of Humility and Charitable condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one to another, performs this ſervile Office himſelf <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 14, 15.</note> towards them; which he might as well have done after Supper, if it had not been uſual to have Waſhed in Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Seeing then it appears partly from Scripture, and partly from Ancient Monuments of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtoms, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont both before and at their Civil and Religious Feaſts to Waſh, and particularly at the Paſſover; then it's very probable our Lord did ſo too, and altered his poſture as they did; nay it is very probable that our Lord, to make his Diſcipels under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he was about to do, did at the Inſtitution of this new Feaſt, the Holy Sacrament of his Body and Bloud, Waſh before it; and having changed the poſture that he was in before at the Eating of the Paſchal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, did not reſume it, but uſed a new poſture at this new Feſtival-Solemnity; but what that was, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. At the beginning of the Paſchal Feaſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> did put themſelves into this Diſcumbing or Leaning poſture, and uſed it while they Eat and Drank the two
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:612"/> firſt Cups of Wine (for every Gueſt was obliged to <note place="margin">As the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſt and foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Writers teſtify. Vid. Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> Hor.

                           <p n="3">3. Before they Drank of the third Cup, the Maſter of the Feaſt took a piece of Unleavened Bread and brake it, and after he had Eat ſome himſelf, he offers the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt in Ex. 12. 8. 11.</note> to the reſt of the Company, to do the like. After this he proceeds to take ſome of the bitter Herbs, and to dip them in a thick Sawce called by them <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeth</hi> (which was formed in the ſhape of a Brick, to repreſent the hard ſlavery undergone by their Fore-fathers in the Brick-Kilns of <hi>Egypt)</hi> and commanded all the Societie to follow his example. Now this was not done in an inclining poſture, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Buxt.</hi> Syn. c. 13. p. 300.</note> teach us; and they give this reaſon for it, becauſe this was to put them in mind of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, and therefore here they ſtood in all probability, becauſe to eat Standing was the manner of Slaves, whereas Lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <note place="margin">Peſachin, fol. 37. 2. Hor. Heb. 291, 292.</note> after a Lordly manner, was in token of that eaſe and reſt they enjoyed in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of their redemption from the Houſe of Bondage. So often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they Eat the bitter Herbs, ſo often they changed their Geſture.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Though the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Solemn Feaſts uſed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbing, yet in bleſſing and giving thanks before thoſe Feaſts they were, as <hi>Philo</hi> relateth, in a Standing Geſture, <note place="margin">In vita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat. p. 663 Col. Allobro. edit. 1613. p. 695.</note> with their Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven. And therefore it's no way probable that Chriſt and his Apoſtles would continue in their Table-Geſture at the bleſſing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:612"/> of the Holy Supper, which is an higher Ordinance than the Paſſover: Becauſe this would be very unſutable to ſo great a Solemnity; Eſpecially too, if Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s Opinion be true (and it may be ſo for any thing that appears to the contrary,) <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt changed the third Cup at the Paſſover, called the Cup of bleſſing, into the Sacramental Cup; becauſe it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> then, to alter their Table-Geſture that was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Paſſover; and it's highly Improbable that our Lord would continue in the Table-Geſture contrary to the General and Currant Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews.</hi> They that don't think ſo as I do in this particular, will receive little advantage by being croſs. For if it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that our Lord Sate ſometimes when the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to Stand, it may equally be ſuppoſed that he Stood ſometimes when the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to Sit; and what becomes of their Argument for Sitting at the Sacrament after the example of Chriſt? becauſe that ſtands built upon ſuppoſition that our Lord Sate at the Paſſover, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, and continued in the ſame Geſture when he Inſtituted the Sacrament, which was before the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal-Solemnity was over. I will onely obſerve this brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way, and then proceed to ſhut up all upon this Head.</p>
                           <p>That thoſe Nonconformiſts who cry out ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Church for Impoſing, and her Members for uſing a Kneeling Geſture, were very unfortunate in their choice when they pitcht upon Sitting, and urged it as the onely neceſſary Geſture to receive in, in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to our Saviours Practice and Example: Becauſe the Standing Geſture may be much better maintained and defended than Sitting, and hath more and greater proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities attending it.</p>
                           <p>If therefore variety of Geſtures were uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> at the Paſſover, and it no where appears from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:613"/> Scripture that our Lord did not comply in this matter, then we cannot know for certain what the particular Geſture was which Chriſt uſed at the Inſtitution of the Sacrament: it might be Lying along, and it might be Sitting upright; it might be Standing in an adoring po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, with his hands and eyes lifted up to Heaven; which is much more probable than either of the former, for the reaſons forementioned: we cannot certainly ſay which; and yet we muſt be certain of one, before we can build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as an Infallible Rule of Conſcience. Let it be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore granted to our Brethren who differ from us in this point, that our Saviour Sate at the Paſſover, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was Inſtituted by him before the Paſchal Feaſt was fully ended, that the Diſciples Eat the Sacramental Bread, and Drank the Sacramental Cup, in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as they Eat and Drank at the Paſſover: What of all this? how will the neceſſity of a Sitting Geſture appear from theſe premiſes? Why, thus: Therefore our Lord Inſtituted and Adminiſtred the Holy Sacrament Sitting, ſay they. How doth this follow of courſe, I ask? Since they Eat and Drank in ſeveral poſtures at the Paſchal Feaſt.</p>
                           <p>I confeſs the Argument had been ſtrong, if they could make it appear, that throughout the whole Solemnity of the Paſſover no other Geſture but Sitting was uſed by our Lord. But this I am ſure can never be done, and conſequently their concluſion can never be good. From the whole I conclude thus much: Since the example of our Lord cannot be certainly known in this matter, our Church cannot be charged for deviating from it: And conſequently, to ſcruple Conformity to the practice of our Church, becauſe ſhe doth not Conform to the practice of Chriſt which no body can certify us of, is very Unjuſt and Unreaſonable.</p>
                           <p>2. Suppoſing our Lord did Sit as they will have it,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:613"/> yet his bare example doth not oblige all Chriſtians to a like Practice.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe naked examples without ſome Rule or Note added to them to ſignify that it is the mind and will of God to have them conſtantly followed and perpetually Imitated by us, have not the force of a Law perpetually obliging the Conſcience. Thus in our preſent Caſe, though our Lord did Sit at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet his example alone doth not become an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Rule for all Ages to obſerve, becauſe he hath no where diſcovered his binding will and pleaſure in this particular. And conſequently, ſince he hath left us in the Dark, we may act contrary to his will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, when we ſo zealouſly preſs and follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, eſpecially in this matter relating to Geſture. For even under the Law, where all other Circumſtances of Time, Place, Habits, and the Ceremonies relating to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, were with great particularity deſcribed, this of Geſture was left free and undetermined. God never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to uſe any particular Geſture in any particular part of his Worſhip, but left it to their choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Kneel, or Stand, or Bow down their Heads and Bodies, or fall proſtrate on the Earth; to uſe all, or any one of theſe, as Cuſtom and their own Pious Prudence ſhould prompt and direct them. Seeing then that the Geſture in the Worſhip of God was never determined under the Law: Since it was and is in its own nature a Mutable Ceremony in the Service of God, it remains ſo unto this day: Our Lord left it as he found it, unleſs it can be proved that he hath by ſome Command or Note of Immutability fixt and determined it to all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages. But becauſe no ſuch Command or Note is to be found, therefore we are not tyed in Conſcience to a ſtrict Imitation of his Example. A few inſtances will clear this point. Our Lord was not Baptized till <note place="margin">Luke 3. 23.</note>
                              <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:614"/> he was about thirty years of Age; but this example is not eſteemed by the generality of Diſſenters a Law or Warrant for us to defer our Baptiſm ſo long. So he Inſtituted the Sacrament a little before his Death: But is there no obligation upon us to receive it but when we are near our Graves, and under a Proſpect of Death? He alſo Inſtituted and Adminiſtred the Sacrament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a full Meal, in an upper Room, to Men onely. Doth his bare example oblige us to obſerve punctually all theſe Circumſtances, or no? If it doth, why do our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Separation take the liberty to depart from his example in theſe things? if his example layeth no neceſſity upon us to follow it in theſe particulars, how doth Sitting become neceſſary barely upon the account of his example? I deſire them therefore Seriouſly and impartially to examine this matter, and ſee if they can aſſign any reaſons for this liberty they take of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of our Saviour in ſome things, and not in others, where there is no other Rule to guide them. I believe they will be conſtrained to do one of theſe two things; either to withdraw their Suit againſt Kneeling, and quit their own Principle; or condemn their own practices, as ſhamefully repugnant to it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The bare example of Chriſt is no Warrant for us to act by, becauſe the great end and uſefulneſs of that Glorious example he left us, conſiſts in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſhews the poſſibility, and clears up the ſenſe of his Laws, and excites and encourages us to the Practice of them; it puts the Rule into activity, and ſets it forth to the life. It is to our lives, as Exhortation is to Doctrine, it thruſts us forward to do that which we were obliged in Conſcience to do before. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our Lord hath Commanded us to do, in that onely we are neceſſarily bound to Imitate him: But where there is no Precept, there is no Neceſſity.</hi> We may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:614"/> do it if we will, and if we can innocently <hi>(as in the caſe of a ſingle Life)</hi> but we are not under Conſtraint, and an indiſpenſable Obligation. He hath Commanded us to be Meek and Lowly, to be Juſt and Merciful, to be Patient under all our Troubles and Afflictions, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Peace with all Men, to be ever contented and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Will of our Heavenly Father in all States and Conditions of Life, and the life: And in all theſe things he became an Example to us, that we might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Steps. He Commands us to do what he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf; and that which we are concerned in, if we would walk ſurely, is firſt to look for our Rule, and then for our encouragement to look unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith. It's true indeed, we are Commanded in Scripture to follow the Examples of the Apoſtles ſo far forth as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt, and the Example of our Lord is made the Touchſtone to try all others by; but then if we would know what is out Duty, we muſt bring his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the Rule. For as to Preach Chriſt and to Preach the Goſpel, to Obey Chriſt and Obey the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1. Acts 5. 42. Acts 11. 20. Marc. 16. 15. Heb. 5. 9. 2 Theſſ. 1. 8. Col. 2. 6.</note> Goſpel, are Phraſes of alike Import it Scripture; ſo in like manner, to follow Chriſt, is all one with follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel-Rule, or doing as Chriſt did in obedience to his Commands. The Sum of all is this; An Example may help to Interpret a Law, but of it ſelf it is no Law: Againſt a Rule no Example is a Competent Warrant; and if the Example be according to the Rule, it's not the Example but the Rule that is the Meaſure of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The bare Example of Chriſt is no Warrant for us to go by, becauſe he was an extraordinary Perſon, and did many things which we cannot, and many which we muſt not do. He Faſted 40 Days and 40 Nights, and ſpent whole Nights in Prayer; he wrought many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:615"/> Miracles, to prove the Truth of his Doctrine and his Divine Authority by, that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son of God, and Saviour of Mankind; he was a Prophetical Prieſt, by which Office he was obliged to teach us the whole mind of God in all things neceſſary to Faith and Salvation, and to offer up himſelf as a propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the Sins of the World. Nothing (we ſhould quickly experiment) would be more Vain and Fooliſh, than attempts of an Imitation in ſome things: And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Wicked, than to think and believe we may and ought to follow his example in others. To dye to Sin, and Crucify the Fleſh with its Affections and Luſts, is a good way (as the Scripture Teaches and Warrants) of Imitating our Lords Death in a Spiritual Senſe. So, to Die rather than deny the Faith and Diſhonour our Saviour, is great and Praiſeworthy; but to Die for Sin, either our own or other Men's, to propoſe a Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Death to our Selves, and by way of expiation, is a Sin of ſo deep a Stain, that the Blood of Chriſt will not Waſh out: For this in effect is Trampling upon and Vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Precious Blood of our Saviour, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Virtue and Merits of his Sacrifice, and thereby render it weak and inſufficient to ſave us. Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore to follow the Example of Chriſt, is a certain way to run into Error and Miſchief. We muſt then of neceſſity, if we would follow him ſafely, ſeek out for a plain Rule in the Word of God, or guide our Selves by the Dictates of Reaſon and Prudence; and either way is a ſufficent Demonſtration that a bare Example is not to be truſted to. Thoſe who urge the example of Chriſt for Sitting, were ſomewhat ware of this, namely, that his example, and thoſe of his Apoſtles, are not to be Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by us in all things; and therefore they lay down this <note place="margin">

Beſides, if we are not to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate them in ſuch things which they were moved to do upon ſpecial reaſons which did not concern us, then we are obliged to Imitate their examples in ſuch things as they did upon general and common reaſons which concern us as well as them, or we are not obliged at all by any Example; and if ſo, then thoſe reaſons are our Rule, to which we are to reduce their Examples. Without we find ſome general or common Reaſon, we have no Warrant (according to their own Principle) to follow their Examples; and when ſuch Reaſons do appear, then it's not the example alone that obliges us, but Reaſon that approves the Example. To bring their own Rule to the caſe in Hand: How do they know but our Lord was moved to Sit at the Sacrament by Special reaſons drawn from that Time and Place, from the Feaſt of the Paſſover to which that Geſture was peculiar? How do they know but that our Lord might have uſed another Geſture, if the Sacrament had been Inſtituted apart from the Paſſover?</p>
                           <p>The neceſſity of the time, made the <hi>Jews</hi> Eat the Paſſover after one faſhion in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which afterward ceaſing, gave occaſion to alter it in <hi>Canaan;</hi> and how do we know but that our Lord complyed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity, and that his Example (if he did Sit) was onely temporary, and not deſigned for a Standing Law perpetually obliging to a like practice? If Chriſt acted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:616"/> upon ſpecial reaſons, then we are not obliged, by their own Rule; and if he did not, let them produce the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons if they can, which make this Example of Chriſt of general and perpetual uſe, and to oblige all Chriſtians to follow it. When ever they do this, I am ſure they will expoſe their own Principle which they have built ſo much upon, to the Scorn and Contempt of the World; which is this: <hi>That the bare example of Christ and good</hi>

                           <p n="4">4. It's abſurd to talk of Chriſts Example apart from all Law and Rule, and to make that alone a Principle of Duty diſtinct from the precepts of the Goſpel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt himſelf, all the while the World enjoyed the benefit of his example, governed his actions by a Law. For if we conſider him as a <hi>Man,</hi> like unto us in all things (Sin onely excepted) he was Born under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the Moral and Natural Law; as a <hi>Jew,</hi> under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law; as the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſent of God into the World to compaſs the great Work of our Redemption which he had freely undertaken, he ſtill acted by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment, and was under the Goſpel-Law. He came to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, and to teach us the whole Mind and Will of God, and Exemplify to us what he taught and delivered. That which made that bitter and deadly Cup which ended his Days reliſh with him, was this conſideration, that it was a Cup given him by <note place="margin">John 18. 11.</note> his Father, and the Drinking it was agreeable to his will; and it was the comfort and ſupport of his Soul a little before his Death, that he had finiſhed the Work

If therefore we onely look to his Example, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the various Capacities and Relations he bare, both towards God and towards us, and the ſeveral Laws by which he ſtood Bound, which were the meaſures of his Actions, we ſhall miſerably miſtake our way, and bewilder our ſelves; we ſhall Act like Fools, when we do ſuch things as he did purſuant to infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Thus (to give but one inſtance) if we ſhould Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our ſelves to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as he did (for he fulfilled the Ceremonial Law, which he came to aboliſh) we ſhould thereby fruſtrate the great Deſign of the Goſpel, and of our Saviours coming into the World: And yet even this we are obliged to do, if his Example alone, be a ſufficient Warrant for our Actions. I have ſtaid the longer upon this Head, becauſe ſo ill a uſe hath been made of Scripture-Examples, and to ſhew how far forth we may ſafely ſteer by them, I ſcarce know any one Doctrine ſo teeming and big with Error, ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Souls of private Perſons, and the Peace of Publick Societies both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>as that which teaches us to Learn and Derive our Duty from, and to Judge of the Goodneſs and Badneſs of our Actions by the Examples of Christ, and good Men, over and above what we are obliged to do by the Precepts and Laws of the Goſpel.</hi>

                           <p>3. They who urge the Example of Chriſt againſt Kneeling at the Sacrament, as our Rule to which we ought to Conform, do not follow it themſelves. Becauſe the poſture he Inſtituted the Sacrament in, which they ſay was a Paſſover-Geſture, was (if ſo) very different
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:617"/> from that which they ſo earneſtly plead for and uſe at this day. For that was a Diſcumbing or Leaning Geſture on the left ſide, much after the manner that we lye upon Couches, with the upper part of the body almoſt erect. It is agreed by all Learned Men, that this was the Ancient Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time, and is ſo to this day at the Paſſover, by which Geſture they diſtinguiſh this Feſtival Night from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now if the ſame Geſture were uſed by Chriſt at the Sacrament as was at the Paſſover, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample makes it neceſſary and obligatory to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for what Reaſons and by what Authority do our Diſſenting Brethren change it into Sitting upright, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Civil way and manner of Feaſting? When they tell us this, it will be very eaſy to juſtify Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the ſame Authority which they ſhall alledge for Sitting; and our changing the Geſture will be as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable as theirs. Unleſs they will ſay, that they alone have the Power and Priviledge to recede from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt when and how far they pleaſe, but our Church hath not, nor any other upon the face of the Earth. To ſay Sitting, as they do, comes nearer to the Geſture uſed by our Lord at the Paſſover, and conſequently (as is ſuppoſed) at the Sacrament, then the Kneeling Geſture, according to the Cuſtom of our Church, will do them no ſervice: For there is no Room for this Queſtion, Who cometh neareſt to the Example, they or we? when they ought not at all to vary, if they keep to their own Rule. The Example of Chriſt, as it is urged by them againſt Kneeling, equally Concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all other Geſtures beſides what he himſelf uſed: And then the ſuppoſed Geſture which he obſerved binds to Lying along. For where we have nothing to go by but his Pattern, we muſt cut exactly by it, or elſe we take a liberty to do that of our own heads for which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:617"/> we have no allowance: That is, we leave the Pattern which we were obliged onely to follow, and act at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon our own heads; and then the Pattern can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alledg'd for our Juſtification. Though our Church therefore doth not ſtrictly follow the Example of Chriſt (as is objected) by requiring all her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants to Kneel, yet they have no reaſon to complain and to ſcruple Communicating with us, who do not follow it themſelves, but receive the Sacrament in their ſeparate Congregations in a Geſture different from what our Lord uſed at the firſt Inſtitution of it. The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians (if one may Argue from their Practices to their Principles) lay very little ſtreſs on this Argument taken from the Example of Chriſt. For though they generally chooſe to Sit, yet they do not Condemn Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Sinful, or Unlawful in its ſelf; and ſeveral are willing to Receive it in that poſture, in our Churches: which ſurely is every whit as wide from the Pattern our Lord is ſuppoſed to have ſet us, (whether he Lay along or Sate upright) as that which is Injoyned and Practiſed by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> There is too a Confeſſed variation allowed of and Practiſed by the generality of Diſſenters, both Presbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, from the Inſtitution and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in the other Sacrament of Baptiſm. For they have changed Immerſion or Dipping, into aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Sprinkling and Pouring Water on the Face. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16. Mat. 28. 19.</note> by Immerſion or Dipping, is ſutable to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Lord, and the Practice of his Apoſtles, and was by them ordained and uſed to repreſent our Burial with Chriſt, a Death unto Sin, and a New Birth <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4. 6. 11. Col. 2. 12.</note> unto Righteouſneſs, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains that Rite. Now it's very ſtrange that Kneeling at the Lord's Supper (though a different Geſture from that which was uſed at the firſt Inſtitution) ſhould become a Stumbling-block
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52190:618"/> in the way of Weak and Tender Conſciences, that it's more unpaſſable than the <hi>Alpes;</hi> and yet they can with Eaſe and Cheerfulneſs paſs by as great or a greater change in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and Chriſten as we do, without the leaſt murmur or complaint. Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Kneeling, or Standing, were none of them Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted or uſed to ſignify and repreſent any thing Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Lord's Supper, as Dipping all over was; why cannot Kneeling then be without any wrong to the Conſcience, as Safely and Innocently uſed as Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? How comes a Gnat (to uſe our Saviours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb) to be harder to ſwallow than a Camel? Or why ſhould not the Peace and Unity of the Church, and Charity to the Publick, prevail with them to Kneel at the Lord's Supper, as much (or rather more) as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Tenderneſs to the Infants Body, to Sprinkle or pour Water on the Face, contrary to the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                           <p>4. They who Kneel at the Sacrament in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions of the Church whereof they are Members, do manifeſtly follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>For our Saviour complyed with that Paſſover-Geſture which was at that time commonly and generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but cannot be pretended to be <note place="margin">Altar. Dam. 745. 747.</note> the ſame that was uſed at the firſt Inſtitution of that Feaſt in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For thus the Command runs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>And thus ſhall ye Eat it; with your Loyns Girded, your Shoes on your Feet, and your Staff in your Hand: And you ſhall Eat it in haſte; it is the Lord's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover.</hi> This, ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, was but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Law, ſuted to the neceſſity of that time, and ſerved for that Night onely, and did not oblige the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Generations in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> For thus they comment upon it: Four things were contained in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:618"/> this Law, which did not oblige but for that night at the <note place="margin">Vid. Mr. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> Exod. 12. 6. 11.</note> Paſſover in <hi>Egypt.</hi> 1. Eating of the Lamb in their Houſes diſperſed in <hi>Egypt.</hi> 2. Taking up of the Lamb from the tenth Day. 3. Striking the Blood on their Door-Poſts. 4. Eating in Haſte. Here the Geſture in all probability was Standing, though it be not expreſly mentioned: Howſoever, it was different from that uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time, which was a Geſture denoting Eaſe and Reſt, and their deliverance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. And our Lord's Complyance with this Cuſtom may teach us thus much, That we ſhould not be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous about Geſtures, but conform to the Innocent and prevailing Cuſtoms of the Church whereſoever we live.

                           <p>To ſum up all upon this ſecond Query: Seeing that we can never be certain of the particular Geſture uſed by Chriſt at the Inſtitution of the Holy Sacrament: Seeing his bare Example (ſuppoſing he did Sit) doth not oblige us in Conſcience to Imitate it: Seeing they who urge his Example do not follow it themſelves, even in that particular they urge it for: Seeing Conformity to the Geſture preſcribed by Law, is a plain Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Example and Practice of Chriſt, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the Equity, Reaſon, and Spiritual Meaning and Inſtruction of it. I think no Man can reaſonably object againſt Kneeling, and ſcruple in Conſcience a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to it, as being repugnant to the Example of our Lord.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:619"/> and Reaſons our Diſſenting Brethren build their ſcruples againſt Kneeling, as being no Table-Geſture. By a Table-Geſture we are to underſtand thus much; That at the Lord's Supper we ought in their Judgment to uſe the ſame Geſture as we do at our ordinary Meals and Tables, at our Civil Feaſts and Entertainments: And becauſe divers Geſtures are uſed at Meals, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different Modes and Cuſtoms of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, therefore we are obliged to uſe that at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which the Cuſtom of our Country hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed at our Ordinary and Civil Meals. Thus (ſaith the Author of <hi>Altare Damaſcenum,</hi> a Stout and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Champion for a Table-Geſture, <hi>Sitting croſs-legged</hi>

                              <hi>a Banquet, and therefore requires a Supper, a Feast, a Banquet-Geſture. And ſuch a Geſture must be uſed as Standeth with the Cuſtom of the Country. In no Nation was it ever held Comely to Kneel at their Banquets, or</hi>

                              <hi>to Receive their food Kneeling.</hi> So that according to the ſenſe of their own Writers, and great Patrons of Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, this is the reaſon why they queſtion the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Kneeling: That the Geſture at the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ought to be the ſame with that which we uſe and obſerve at our Ordinary Tables, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Faſhion of our Native Country wherein we live.</p>
                           <p>And then the full Import and meaning of the Query is this: <hi>Whether the nature of the Sacrament, conſidered as a Feast, doth not require and oblige us to Sit and not Kneel, becauſe Sitting and not Kneeling is the Ordinary Table-Geſture, according to the Mode and Faſhion of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:620"/>
                           <p>Here the Reader may obſerve, that this Argument for Sitting, drawn from the nature of this Holy Feaſt, quite overthrows the two former Arguments drawn from the expreſs Command and Example of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and renders them uſeleſs and unſerviceable to their cauſe.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. For they don't ſay we are obliged to uſe the ſame Geſture with our Lord, but only a Table-Geſture, though never ſo different from that which he uſed, according to the Cuſtom of our Country where we live. Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Geſtures, according to the Variety of Faſhions and Uſages of ſeveral Nations at their Common Feaſts, may be all Comely and Sutable to the Nature of this Holy Feaſt. According to this Argument, therefore, we are not obliged to Sit, becauſe Chriſt did at the Sacrament; and then his bare Example is no Rule to us in this matter. His Example was Governed and Guided by the Nature of the Sacrament, and the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Our Lord Inſtituted the Sacrament before the Paſchal Feaſt was over, and he continued in the ſame poſture which he uſed at the Paſſover, ſay they, and that was Sitting. Suppoſe this, what follows? Why therefore we are bound to Sit too, after his Example. No, by no means, ſay I, unleſs it be the Cuſtom of our Country to Sit at our Meals, and Sitting be our Common Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Geſture: Which is the ſtrength of this Argument drawn from the Nature of the thing, if we may believe what they ſay themſelves.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Again, if the Nature of the Sacrament require a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Geſture, and we are obliged to uſe that in particular which ſtandeth with the Cuſtom of our Country, and the Geſtures may be different according as their Cuſtoms differ, then God hath no where Commanded the uſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:620"/> of any particular Geſture, nor obliged all Chriſtians in all places to obſerve one and the ſame.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And then Thirdly, we may Lawfully obſerve ſome things in the Worſhip of God, for which we have no Command or Example in the Holy Scriptures, if this Argument of the Table-Geſture be good. And this principle, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ought not to do any thing in the Worſhip of God, but what we have ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Example for in Scripture, is the great batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Engine which hath been conſtantly imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ceremonies enjoyned by our Church; and it <hi>is a Principle wherein the Myſtery of Puritaniſme doth</hi>

Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves our Brethren not to be fond of this Table-Geſture, as they love the Life of their Cauſe. I am ſure no greater Argument can be afforded of a routed baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled Cauſe in the matter of Sitting at the Sacrament, than to ſee the Patrons of it running up and down in Confuſion, and flying for Refuge ſometime to the Command of Chriſt, then to his Example; when driven out there, then to the Nature of the thing and Civil Cuſtoms, and about again to the Example. For thus the Authors of the fore-mentioned Tracts do. Thus much being premiſed, I proceed to Conſider the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed; for the Reſolution whereof, I ſhall</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Enquire into the Nature of the Holy Sacrament, that ſo we may truly underſtand what Geſture is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or repugnant to it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Shew that the Nature of the Lord's Supper doth not abſolutely require and neceſſarily oblige us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Common Table-Geſture, in order to our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiving.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That Kneeling is very Comely, and agreeable to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:621"/> the Nature of the Lord's Supper, though no Table-Geſture.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That the Primitive Church and Ancient Fathers had no ſuch notion of the neceſſity of a Table-Geſture as is maintained and urged by Diſſenters.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As to the Nature of the Sacrament, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcover it under theſe following Heads.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, the Sacrament in the Holy Scripture is called the Lord's Table, and the Lord's Supper, and and Banquet, by the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, becauſe of that Proviſion and Entertainment which our Lord hath made for all worthy Receivers. It is ſtyled a Supper and a Feaſt, either becauſe it was Inſtituted by Chriſt at Supper-time, at night; or becauſe it repreſents a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and a Feaſt: And ſo it is not of the ſame Nature with a Civil and Ordinary Supper and Feaſt, though it bear the ſame name. There is ſome reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Holy Feaſt and Civil Feaſts; and the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein it lies, will in part explain its Nature. There are three things Eſſential and Neceſſary to a Feaſt, and included in the notion of it: Plenty, good Company, and Mirth. And upon the account of theſe, the Sacrament is (conſidered in its own Nature) properly a Banquet, a Feaſt; but then it is a Heavenly and Spiritual one, conſiſting of Spiritual Graces and benefits, Communion with Chriſt and with all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſignified by, and tendered under the outward Elements of Bread and Wine: and even in theſe three particulars which are Eſſential to it, conſidered as a Feaſt, and are neceſſary ingredients into all Feaſts whatſoever, it very much differs from Civil and Ordinary Feaſts. For though there be <hi>Plenty,</hi> yet it doth not conſiſt of Variety of Diſhes, to gratifie our Palats, or ſatisfie our Hunger, as other Feaſts do, and particularly the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover did, where the Body was filled and Feaſted as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52190:621"/> well as the mind. The proviſion wherewith our Lord hath Furniſhed out his Table, is not of an Earthly and periſhing, but of an Heavenly and Immortal Nature, even the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which we Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Feaſt upon.</p>
                           <p>Alas, if we only fix our Eyes and Thoughts upon what is placed on the Table, and thoſe ſmall portions of Bread and Wine allotted us to Eat and Drink, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lifting up our Hearts (as <note n="*" place="margin">So St. <hi>Cypr.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> and St. <hi>Aug.</hi> expound this Exhort. of the Miniſter at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Cyp.</hi> de orat. Dom. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> Hom. de Encaeniis, <hi>Aug.</hi> de ver. Relig. c. 3.</note> our Church exhorts us to do, by the Miniſter, in her Communion-Office) to thoſe Heavenly and Inviſible good things, couched under, and ſignified by the outward Elements of Bread and Wine, what is there in all that we ſee that deſerves the name of a Feaſt, or can by the help of any figure (but an Irony) be called by that name? Did ever any Man eſteem that a Feaſt, where there was not Meat enough to fill his Mouth, nor Drink enough to quench his thirſt? It is upon the account therefore of thoſe Inviſible and Spiritual good things, wherewith the Souls, not the Bodies of worthy Communicants are Strengthened and Refreſhed (of which the Bread and Wine are but the Types and Shadows) that the Sacrament is, and may truly be called a Feaſt or Banquet. And for this reaſon <note n="†" place="margin">St. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> in Pſ. 90. <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> orat. 40. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſol.</hi> Catech. and others.</note> the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers called it a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Feaſt,</hi> and the Table <hi>a Myſtical Table;</hi> and the Cup, <hi>the Cup of Myſteries:</hi> and the Sacrament, take it all together, was by them Styled <hi>the Myſtical Supper, the Myſtery, and Myſteries,</hi> as Preſenting one thing to the Eye, and another to the Mind.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. As Plenty is one neceſſary ingredient into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Feaſt, ſo alſo is Choice and Select Company. Feaſts are made in expectation of Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. A Man may Dine alone, but in Proper and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Speech, no Man is ſaid to Feaſt alone. Now though the Sacrament doth reſemble our Common
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52190:622"/> Feaſts in this Particular (and therefore hath obtained the name of <hi>Communion,</hi> and the Gueſts <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> which Phraſes do naturally import Number or Society:) yet if we conſider what the perſons are that conſtitute this Society, and with whom Communion is held, the Nature of this Spiritual Feaſt will further appear.</p>
                           <p>And truly our Communion is with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the three Divine Perſons of the Holy Trinity; though principally our Lord Jeſus, the Maſter of this Feaſt, in and through whom we all have <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 18.</note> acceſs by one Spirit to the Father, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. This high and ineſtimable priviledge and Honour of being admitted into the Preſence of God, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friendly Correſpondence and Converſe with him at his Table, is founded on the Blood of Chriſt, which we thankfully Commemorate at this Solemnity, by <hi>which we who were afar off are made nigh,</hi> as the ſame <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13.</note> Divine Writer hath it. Moreoever, by Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Lord's Table, we are United to, and hold Communion with all Faithful Chriſtians and worthy Communicants, the Members of his Myſtical Body the Church, whom he hath redeemed and cleanſed by his moſt precious Blood. And that which qualifies a Man for ſuch Communion, doth not Conſiſt in External Garbs or Ornaments of the Body, but in Holy and Virtuous Diſpoſitions of Soul, in a <hi>Penitent, Humble, Charitable, Thankful, and Obedient Heart.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Another thing neceſſary to a Feaſt is Mirth and Joy, (which implies alſo good diſcourſe) and in this too the Sacrament reſembles our Common Feaſts. But then the Joy is of a Spiritual Nature, and flows from different Cauſes.</p>
                           <p>Not from what we Taſt and See, not from our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Phanſies pleaſed and tickled with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52190:622"/> and Variety of Diſhes which adorn the Table, nor from our Blood and Spirits raiſed and fermented by generous Wines; but from Divine and Heavenly Conſiderations. From the Boundleſs and Unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Love of God in ſending his onely Begotten and Beloved Son into the World, to lay down his Life and ſhed his Blood as a propitiation for our Sins; from the wonderful Condeſcention of our Dear Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in undertaking this hard Task, in appearing Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with our Fleſh in the form of a Servant, and at laſt Humbling himſelf to the Death of the Croſs for our Sakes; from the Victory he hath gained for us over Death and Hell, and all the Spirits of Darkneſs; from the miraculous Redemption he hath wrought, and the Right and Title to Eternal Life, which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us Sinful Duſt and Aſhes, by his own moſt Precious Blood. This is the ſecret Language and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of every Devout Chriſtian at this Holy Feaſt, and with theſe kind of Meditations he refreſhes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights himſelf. So that from the whole we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Lord's Supper is in its own Nature tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly a Feaſt, though vaſtly different from Common and Ordinary Feaſts throughout, even in thoſe things wherein it ſeems to be like them. As to the ſeveral Names and Phraſes by which the Nature of it is deſcribed, they are figurative, and borrowed from Civil Entertainments: but although it hath received the ſame names, and is repreſented by Phraſes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſute to Ordinary Feaſts, yet the Lord's Supper differs in its Nature from Civil Banquets, as much as Heaven and Earth, Body and Spirit, differ in theirs. As to the Bread and Wine which we ſee and taſt, they are only Signs and Types of the true Spiritual Feaſt, and ſerve to raiſe our minds to, and whet the Appetites of our Souls after Celeſtial and Heavenly Enjoyments.</p>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52190:623"/>
                           <p>Thus much may ſuffice to inform us what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red barely as a Feaſt.</p>
                           <p>2. For a further Diſcovery of its Nature, we are to be minded that it is a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice for Sin, wherein we are particularly to Commemorate the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note> Death of Chriſt by way of expiation for the Sins of the World.</p>
                           <p>3. It was Inſtituted in Honour of our Lord, our great Benefactor and Redeemer; where we meet to preſerve an Eternal memory of his Wondrous Works, to bleſs and praiſe him, and ſpeak good of his Name. And thus partaking of the Lord's Supper is a proper Act of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip performed to our Saviour. It's the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God manifeſted in our Fleſh, and of our Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Lord, who ſubmitted himſelf to a Vile and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Death for the ſake of us Vile and Miſerable Sinners.</p>
                           <p>4. The Lord's Supper is a Myſterious Rite of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, which as it reſpects God the Father, hath the Vertue and Efficacy of a Thankſgiving and a Prayer, as the Sacrifices under the Law had. For our deſires and affections may be ſignified by Actions as well as Words, and by Ceremonies as well as Speech: And with reſpect to this Notion and End of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it was Anciently Stiled <hi>the Liturgy</hi> and the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt;</hi> which laſt name, as it was given to it in the moſt <note place="margin">

                              </note> early Ages of the Church, ſo it ſtill retains the ſame among all the Chriſtian Churches to this day.</p>
                           <p>5. The Lord's Supper was Inſtituted to be a Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Covenanting Rite between God and all worthy Communicants: Where, by permitting us to Eat and <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 24.</note> Drink at his Table, he ſignifies that we are in a State of Peace and Friendſhip, and in a Covenant-relation with him; and we by coming to his Table, and Eating and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52190:623"/> Drinking in his preſence, do own him to be our God and Saviour, and in effect plight our troth to him, and Swear Fidelity and Allegiance to him: we take the Sacrament upon it (as we ordinarily ſay) that we will not henceforth live unto our ſelves, but to him alone that Dyed for us, and gave himſelf for us an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a Sacrifice to God, for a Sweet Smelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                           <p>6. The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this further end, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>a means</hi> to Convey and Apply to us the Merits of that Sacrifice which Chriſt offered for Sinners on the Croſs; and as a Pledge to aſſure us thereof.</p>
                           <p>7. It was inſtituted to be a Sacred Bond of Unity and Concord among all Chriſtians, to engage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to Love one another, as our Lord Loved us, who thought not his Life too dear, nor his Blood too much to part with, for our Sakes.</p>
                           <p>This is a ſhort, and, ſo far as it ſerves my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, a full account of the Nature of the Lord's Supper. If the Reader deſire to ſee theſe things (which I have but touched upon) more largely proved and explained, let him for his ſatisfaction conſult thoſe two excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes (among many others) that paſs under theſe names, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>The Chriſtian Sacrifice.</hi> 2. <hi>Diſcourſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>

                           <p>Howſoever, by what hath been ſaid it appears, that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Nature, and Inſtituted for various ends; that it is vaſtly different both in its nature and ends from Civil and Ordinary Feaſts: And therefore I conclude that we are not at this Religious Feaſt to guide our Selves by the Rules of Common Table-Fellowſhip, but by more Religious and Spiritual Conſiderations. Which leads
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52190:624"/> me to the ſecond thing propoſed for the Reſolution of the preſent Caſe.</p>
                           <p>2. That the Nature of the Lord's Supper doth not abſolutely require and neceſſarily oblige us to obſerve a Table-Geſture, in order to a right and worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it. The Reaſons that I ſhall offer for the Proof of this, are theſe:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. If the Nature of the Sacrament conſidered as a Feaſt neceſſarily requires a Table-Geſture, then the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament conſidered as a Feaſt equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for all other Formalities which are either Eſſential to all Civil Feaſts whatſoever, or to all Feaſts as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain among us. For if Sitting be neceſſary, purely becauſe the Nature of a Feaſt requires it, then all other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which the Nature of a Feaſt requires, will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually neceſſary too. But our Diſſenting Brethren will by no means allow of this, nor think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve all other formalities, though equally ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and agreeable to the Nature of a Feaſt as Sitting is: Though for what good reaſon, I am perfectly in the dark.</p>
                           <p>For 1. As they omit many things at the Sacrament that are as agreeable to the Nature of a Feaſt as the Table-Geſture is; So they obſerve ſeveral Modes and Circumſtances which are not agreeable to the nature of a Feaſt, as the Cuſtom of our Country ſtandeth. For inſtance, at our Common and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Feaſts it's very ſutable and agreeable to Laugh, to Talk, and Diſcourſe together; to Congratulate one anothers welfare, to enquire of the State of abſent Friends and Acquaintance, to Sit with the Head Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to Eat plentifully and Drink Frequently, to Carve and Drink to one another. It is further neceſſary and convenient, that at ſuch Feaſts the Gueſts ſhould be well attended with Servants and Waiters, who are not allowed to Sit down at the Table with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>hoſe who are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52190:624"/> Invited. It's agreeable that the Gueſts ſhould, if they pleaſe, help themſelves and their Friends where they like. And yet theſe (and many other things of this Nature) though very ſutable to, and commonly practiſed at our Ordinary Feaſts, are not allowed of, nor practiſed by, nor urged as neceſſary to be obſerved at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by our Diſſenting Brethren. But why they ſhould plead for and urge the neceſſity of a Common Table-Geſture as being agreeable to the Nature of a Feaſt or a Banquet, and at the ſame time think there lyes no neceſſity at all upon them to obſerve other Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities equally agreeable to the Nature of Civil Feaſts, and warranted by cuſtom as much as Sitting, is the great knot of the Queſtion, and that which puzzles me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, to unty.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. They obſerve ſeveral Modes and Circumſtances at the Sacrament, which are not agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Feaſt or Supper, nor to the cuſtomary way of Feaſting among us. For example: The Sacrament (ſay they) is a Feaſt, a Supper, and requires a Feaſt, a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Geſture; and then too (ſay I) it requires a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-time. It is called in Scripture <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> and it was Inſtituted the ſame night in which he was betrayed; and it's clear that our Lord Adminiſtred it at Even, and that late, at the cloſe of the Paſchal Feaſt. Now the Nature of a Supper, according to Common uſe and acception, requires the Evening or Night, as the proper and peculiar ſeaſon for it; and yet our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren make no ſcruple of Communicating at Noon.</p>
                           <p>It's not agreeable to the Nature of a Feaſt, that one of the Gueſts, and the Principal one too, ſhould fill out the Wine, and break the Bread, and diſtribute it to the reſt of the Society; but this the Diſſenters general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow of and practice at the Holy Communion. It's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52190:625"/> not agreeable to the Nature of a Feaſt, to Sit from the Table, diſperſed up and down the Room. In all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Feaſts there are ſeveral Tables provided, when one is not big enough to receive the Gueſts; and yet the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters generally receive in their Pews, ſcattered up and down the Church; and think one Table is ſufficient, though not capable of receiving the twentieth part of the Communicants, in ſome large Pariſhes and numerous Aſſemblies: And where they are few in number, that they may come up to and Sit at the Table, they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are againſt it (eſpecially the Presbyterians) and think they are not obliged to obſerve that formality, though conſtantly practiſed at Common and Civil Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It's by no means agreeable to the nature of a Feaſt to be Sorrowful. To Mourn and Grieve at a Feaſt, is as Indecent and Unſutable, as to Laugh at a Funeral. But ſure our Diſſenting Brethren will not ſay, that to come to the Sacrament with a Penitent and a broken Spirit, to come with a hearty Sorrow for all our Sins, which cauſed much Pain and Torment to our Deareſt and Greateſt Friend, our ever-Bleſſed Redeemer: To reflect upon the Agonies of his Soul in the Garden, the Bitterneſs of his deadly Cup, the Torture he endured on the Croſs, with a deep Sympathy and Trouble for the occaſion, they will not ſurely, I ſay, affirm that ſuch a diſpoſition of Heart and Mind is improper and unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Nature of this Holy Feaſt which we Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize in Commemoration of his Death for our ſakes. I make no doubt but all Pious Diſſenters bring along with them to the Sacrament ſuch a temper; but this they ought not to do, if their Rule hold good, <hi>viz.</hi> That at this Feaſt we ought to be guided by the Rules of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Table-Fellowſhip.</p>
                           <p>2. The Nature of the Lord's Supper doth not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily require a Common Table-Geſture, becauſe it's not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52190:625"/> of the ſame Nature with Common and Ordinary Feaſts. It is very ill Logick, as well as ill Divinity to argue from Natural and Civil things to Spiritual; to conclude that becauſe they agree in their names, they are of the ſame Nature, For example: When any Man, who hath led a looſe, ſenſual, wicked Life, is awakened and excited by the Grace of God to conſider and take up, to mind Heavenly things, and to breath after God, and Chriſt, and Eternity; to alter his mind and his manners, and lead quite another Life from what he did before, this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in Scripture-Phraſe ſaid to be Regenerate and Born again. But if we would go about to judge of the true Nature of Regeneration and the new Birth purely by the Correſpondency it holds with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Birth, and argue from the Natural to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, we ſhould Entertain very groſs and ſilly Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Regeneration, and greatly miſtake the Nature of it. How ridiculous would it be to preſcribe the ſame Rules to be obſerved by a New Convert, or a New-Born Babe in a Spiritual Senſe, in Order to his Spiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and growth in Grace, as are preſcribed and practiſed towards Infants and New-Born Babes in a Natural Senſe for the maintenance and preſervation of their Natural Life, and Strength; as, that they ſhould be Swathed, and enter into a Milk-Dyet! And yet this is every way as reaſonable, as to preſcribe Sitting as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the worthy Receiving of the Sacrament, which is a Spiritual Feaſt, becauſe it's agreeable to the Nature of Civil Feaſts: Or (which amounts to the ſame thing) becauſe it's called a Feaſt, therefore it's of the ſame Nature with Ordinary and Common Feaſts; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſuch a Geſture and Behaviour as is neceſſary and requiſit to theſe, is alſo requiſit and neceſſary to the Lord's Supper.</p>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52190:626"/>
                           <p>3. The Nature of the Lord's Supper, conſidered as a Feaſt, doth not neceſſarily require and oblige us to uſe a Common Tale-Geſture, in order to right and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiving, becauſe, in the Judgement and Practice of numerous Diſſenters, it may be worthily Received Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus the Presbyterians (and all their Writers who have engaged againſt Kneeling) do not condemn Standing as Sinful and Unlawful, nor eſteem ſuch as uſe it unworthy Receivers on that account; and yet Standing is no Common Table-Geſture.</p>
                           <p>If any ſhould yet urge the neceſſity of Sitting as the <label type="milestone">

On the other hand, to ſay that the Feaſt of the Paſſover did in its Nature admit of ſeveral Geſtures, is to yield all that I deſire; for then the Sacrament, conſidered as a Feaſt, will admit of ſeveral too, and Conſequently doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to obſerve onely a Feaſt-Geſture for the due Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of it.</p>

                           <p>3. <hi>Kneeling is very Comely, and Agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Lord's Supper, though no Table-Geſture.</hi> Which I hope will be made evident to every Honeſt and Unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed Mind (which Impartially ſeeks after Truth) by theſe following conſiderations:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Kneeling is allowed on all Hands to be a very fit and ſutable Geſture for Prayer and Praiſe, and very apt to expreſs our Reverence, Humility, and Gratitude by, and Conſequently very fit to be uſed at the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, and agreeable to its Nature. This will appear, if we reflect upon what hath been delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature and Ends of the Lord's Supper. For at the Sacrament we expreſs that by Actions (as I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before) which at other times we do by Words; and the Lord's Supper is a Solemn Rite of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which implyes Prayer and Praiſe. It includes all the Parts of Prayer. By partaking of the Signs of his Body broken, and Blood ſhed for our Sins, we do Commemorate, Repreſent, and Shew forth to God the Father, the Sacrifice which his Dearly Beloved Son made upon the Croſs; we Feaſt upon the memorials of the great Sin-Offering: And in ſo doing, we make an open Confeſſion and Acknowledgment of our Guilt and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs to God, and we plead with him in the Vertue of his Sons Blood which was ſhed for us, for the Pardon and Remiſſion of all our Sins. We further Humbly entreat him to be Propitious and Favourable to us, and to beſtow upon us all thoſe benefits which our Lord purchaſed with his moſt Precious Blood.</p>
                           <p>We Intercede with him too at the Communion for the whole Church, that all our Fellow-Chriſtians and true Members of his Body may Receive Remiſſion of their Sins, and all other benefits of his Paſſion. And as Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking at his Table, is a Viſible and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52190:627"/> Prayer in the ſight of God; ſo it is a Viſible Act of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, whereby we let our Heavenly Father ſee that we retain a deep and lively ſenſe of his Unexpreſſible Love, in ſending his onely begotten Son into the World to Dye for us that we might Live through him. And that which enlivens our Faith, and emboldens our hopes of finding Favour and Acceptance at his Hands at this time above others, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Our Prayers and Praiſes are not onely put up in the Name of Chriſt, but preſented, and as it were Writ in his Blood, and offered to God over the great Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. All this our Actions ſignify and ſpeak, when we Eat the Conſecrated Bread, and Drink the Cup of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at the Lord's Table. If therefore theſe things be True (and I think no body who underſtands what he doth when he partakes of the Lord's Supper will gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it) then Kneeling muſt be judged as fitting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be uſed at ſuch a time, when we ſignify our deſires and affections by external Rites and Ceremonies of Gods appointment, as when we do it by Words, that is, when we ſay our Prayers.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Our Diſſenting Brethren (and all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) will Grant, that our Bleſſed Saviour ought to be Worſhipt and Adored by all worthy Communicants, inwardly in their Hearts and Souls, when they Receive the Tokens and Pledges of his tender and exceeding great Love in laying down his Life for the Sins of the whole World. And if ſo, then whatſoever is very apt and meet to expreſs the inward eſteem and veneration of our minds by, can't be thought Unſutable and Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Nature of the Lord's Supper: Becauſe that is a Religious Feaſt Inſtituted in Honour of our Lord, and is a Solemn Act of Chriſtian Worſhip performed to our Crucified Saviour.

Since to Bow our Knees then, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be a proper mode of publick Worſhip, and an External Sign of Reverence; why ſhould an adoring poſture be thought Unmeet and Unſutable to the Sacrament, which in its nature imports Worſhip and Adoration?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. No good Chriſtian, of what Party or Perſwaſion ſoever, will deny, but that to lift our Hands and Eyes to Heaven, and to Employ our Tongues in Uttering the Praiſes of our Bleſſed Redeemer, even in the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, is very agreeable to the Nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; why then ſhould Kneeling be thought Unſutable, which is no more but onely Glorifying God and our Bleſſed Saviour with another part of our Body? Why ſhould the Geſture be ſcrupled at more than the Voice, or the Bowing of my Knees be eſteemed incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unfitting, any more than moving my Tongue, or raiſing my Hands and Eyes to Heaven? Eſpecially if we conſider, that the high degree of Honour and Glory to which our Lord is advanced in the Heavens by God the Father, as the reward of his Humble and Submiſſive Obedience here on Earth, challenges from us all manner of Reſpect and Reverence both of Soul and Body, <hi>He Humbled himſelf, and became Obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus</hi>

                           <p n="5">5. The Sacrament was Inſtituted to be a means of Receiving the benefits of his Death and Paſſion, and a Pledge to aſſure us thereof. If we do but Conſider what invaluable Bleſſings we expect to receive by our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partaking of the Conſecrated Bread and Wine at the Table of our Lord, (ſuch as the forgiveneſs of all our Sins, the plentiful Communications of his Grace and Spirit, and a Right and Title to Eternal Life) we can't think Kneeling an Unmeet and Unbecoming Geſture in the Act of Receiving the Outward Signs and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52190:628"/> Pledges of this Inward and Inviſible Grace. If a Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hearty ſenſe of Gods infinite mercy through the Merits and Sufferings of his Son, and of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold rich benefits which our Lord hath purchaſed with his moſt Precious Blood; if a mind deeply Humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of our own Guilt, and Unworthineſs to Receive any mercy at all from the Hands of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Soveraign Lord, whom we have by number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Heinous Crimes ſo highly provok't and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt us; If ſuch an inward temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul becomes us at this Holy Feaſt, (which I think no Man will deny) then ſurely the moſt Humble and reverential Geſture of our Body will become us too. Why ſhould not a Submiſſive Lowly deportment of Body ſute with this Solemnity, as well as a Humble Lowly Mind? And this is that which our Church De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <note place="margin">See the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the end of the Communion-Service, in the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer.</note> to be the end and deſign of her Injunction, in requiring all her Communicants to Kneel, <hi>viz. for a Signification of an Humble and Grateful acknowledgment of the Benefits of Christ therein given to all worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi>

                           <p>6. They who urge Sitting as neceſſary, and the only agreeable Geſture to the Nature of the Lord's Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's the Common Table-Geſture, muſt make the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament either the ſame with an Ordinary and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Feaſt, or onely like it in ſome reſpects, and unlike it in others; as every like is not the ſame. To make it the ſame, is directly to unhallow and prophane the Ordinance; <hi>it is to Eat and Drink unworthily, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi>

                              <hi>the Lord's Body,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi> For it's clear from that Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, that their not diſtinguiſhing between the Lord's Supper, and a Common Meal or Supper, was their great fault; which he ſharply reproves them for, as that which render'd them unworthy Communicants. Which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52190:629"/> will appear to any that will take the pains to examine <note place="margin">Vid. 20, 21, 22. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with 33, 34.</note> the matter.</p>
                           <p>If the Lord's Supper be not the ſame with an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Feaſt, how comes it to paſs that the ſame Geſture muſt be neceſſarily uſed at both? If they differ in their whole nature, then that which is agreeable to the nature of the one, muſt be Repugnant to the nature of the other. If they agree in ſome reſpects only, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in others, but not in their whole nature, then Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be as proper and ſutable in ſome reſpects, as Sitting is in others. For though the Civil Cuſtom of a Table-Geſture be allowed to ſtrike ſome ſtroke in a Spiritual Ordinance, where there is Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet other reſpects in the Lord's Supper have a ſtroke too, and that the greateſt, if we duly weigh and conſider the ends of its Inſtitution, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed. And if upon ſuch Examination it appear, that Kneeling, or an adoring Geſture, holds fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Correſpondence with the principal reſpects and ends of the Lord's Supper, then the Banquetting Geſture, though Lawful and Sutable in ſome leſs reſpects, muſt and ought in reaſon to give place; at leaſt, it ought not to be Inſiſted on as the onely agreeable and neceſſary Geſture, without which we cannot worthily Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
                           <p>Whatſoever Geſture anſwers the principal reſpects and ends of this Holy Feaſt, beſt Sutes to its Nature, and conſequently ought in reaſon to be beſt eſteemed of, and ſway more with us than any other, if we will wholly guide our ſelves by the Nature of the thing. And that Kneeling or an adoring poſture doth beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Nature and Ends of the Sacrament, I think is clear and undenyable, if the account I have given of the Sacrament be good. I am ſure, howſoever, that there is no reaſon why Sitting ſhould juſtle out Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52190:629"/> as Sinful, and Unſutable to the Nature of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance. Let Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> a Learned Advocate <note place="margin">Annot. in Luk. 22. 14.</note> for Nonconformiſts, be heard in this matter, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it: <hi>A Man must not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>refuſe to Receive the Sacrament Kneeling, when he cannot have it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>4. The Primitive Church and Ancient Fathers had no ſuch notion of the neceſſity of a Table-Geſture, as is maintained and urged by Diſſenters at preſent; which will appear from thoſe Names and Titles they gave to this Holy Feaſt. And Firſt, I obſerve from the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> that for the ſpace of 200 years after Chriſt, there is not the leaſt mention made of the name <hi>Table</hi> in any of their Writings. They call the place on which <note place="margin">Can. Apoſt. 2. St. <hi>Ignat.</hi> in 3 Epiſtles and Philad. Tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. Eph. <hi>Juſtin Mart. Irenaeus.</hi>

Now the Euchariſt conceived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of a Sacrifice, and the place on which it was offered of an Altar, doth not neceſſarily require a Table-Geſture; there is not that ſtrict Connexion and Relation between an Altar or a Sacrifice, and a Common Table-Geſture, as is conceived to be between a Feaſt or Table, and a Feaſt or Table-Geſture.</p>
                           <p>2. The Primitive Chriſtians and Ancient Fathers of the Church did not entertain any ſuch conceits about the neceſſity of a Common Table-Geſture, as our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do. As, that <hi>Kneeling or an adoring Geſture is against</hi>

                              <hi>the Dignity of Guests, and Debarrs us the Priviledges and Prerogatives of the Lord's Table, ſuch as Social admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Social Entertainment; that it is against the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Christ, whoſe intention was to Dignify us by Setting us at his Table;</hi> and much more of this Nature, and to this effect. Now the Primitive Church little dreamt of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52190:630"/> this Dignity and Priviledge of Communicants, of this purpoſe of Chriſt, and of this kind of Fellowſhip and Familiarity with him; as the Phraſes they uſe, and the Auguſt and Venerable Titles they give the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, even when they conſider it as a <hi>Feast</hi> and <hi>Supper,</hi> and ſpeak of the <hi>Table</hi> on which it was Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, plainly demonſtrate. They call it, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, the <hi>Lord's Supper, the Kingly, Royal, and most Divine Supper;</hi> which Import Deference, Diſtance, and Reſpect, on our Parts; <hi>the Dreadful Sacrifice, the Venerable and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbloody Sacrifice, the Wonderful and Terrible Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; the Royal, Spiritual, Holy, Formidable, Tremendous Table.</hi> The Bread and Wine after Conſecration, are in their Language called the <hi>most Myſterious, most Holy Food and Nutriment,</hi> the <hi>most Holy things;</hi> and the place where the Table ſtood, the <hi>most Holy part of the Temple,</hi> in alluſion to that of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple, to which the <hi>Jews</hi> paid the higheſt Reverence. The Bread in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular they Stiled the <hi>Bread of God;</hi> the Cup, the <hi>Holy and Myſterious, the Royal and Dreadful Cup.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Primitive Biſhops and Holy Fathers adviſe the Communicants to <hi>Reverence theſe Holy Myſteries, to come with Fear and Trembling, with Sorrow and Shame, with ſilence and downcast Eyes, to keep their Joy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and to approach the Table with all the Signs and Expreſſions of Reverence and Humility imaginable. How can theſe Speeches conſiſt with that Social, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar carriage at the Sacrament, which the Patrons of the Table-Geſture contend for, as the Priviledge of Gueſts and the Prerogative of the Lord's Table? For a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this whole matter, I deſire our Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren ſeriouſly to conſider two or three Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I ſhall propound to them, and endeavour to frame an Honeſt and Impartial Anſwer, as in the Preſence of God, who ſearches our Hearts, and tryeth our Reins.

                           <p>It is the Cuſtom of our Country to Sit at Feaſts; but few men are ſo mad as to refuſe to Eat Standing, and go Hungry away when they have no room to Sit down. Why ſhould we not be as Prudent at this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

                           <head>Query IV. <hi>Whether Kneeling, commanded in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>be not contrary to the general Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of Chriſt in the firſt and pureſt Ages?</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>THe onely way for any man to give or receive ſatisfaction in this point, is diligently to conſult the Records of ancient Times, and from them make a faithful report of the Cuſtoms and Uſages of the ancient Catholick Church: For when once theſe are made manifeſt, it will be very eaſie, by comparing things together, to diſcern whether they are conſiſtent, or contrary one to another: Whether the Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as to Kneeling at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) be agreeable or repugnant to that of the Primitive Chriſtians. In Anſwer therefore to this Queſtion, my buſineſs is to give a plain Hiſtorical Account of the practice of the Church in thoſe early Ages of Chriſtianity; from whence it may evidently appear, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by obliging her Communicants to Kneel, doth not oblige them to practiſe any thing but what is agreeable to the Cuſtoms and Practice of pure Antiquity. And this I will endeavour to do under theſe Two general Heads.</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>(1.) It's highly probable that the Primitive Church uſed to Kneel in the act of receiving the Holy Sacrament, as our Cuſtom at preſent is.</item>
                              <item>(2.) It's moſt certain they uſed an Adoring Poſture.</item>

                           <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:634"/>
                           <p>But before I enter upon this undertaking, I will crave leave to premiſe ſomewhat concerning this Query in general, and ſomewhat for explication of a Term contained in it, <hi>viz.</hi> What we are to underſtand by <hi>The firſt and pureſt Ages.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As to the Caſe it ſelf in general, it is of ſuch a nature, and requires ſuch an Anſwer, that not one among Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the ordinary and common ſort of people is duely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to underſtand it, and paſs a true judgement upon it: the merits of the Cauſe are quite out of their reach; and whether we are in the right or the wrong they know not, but believe as they are taught, and upon the credit of others who they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are able to inform them about ſuch matters. For in order to eſtimate the preſent Caſe aright and as it ought, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that a man have ſome competent knowledge of and inſight into the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions of the ancient Church, the Decrees of Councils, the Works of the Fathers, and the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Languages wherein they wrote; which, I am ſure, few or none of the Vulgar have attained to.</p>
                           <p>And truly upon this very conſideration I ſhould have paſs'd this Query by without taking the leaſt notice of it, had I not in my converſe with ſeveral Diſſenting Laymen, heard it ſtarted and pleaded in juſtification of their Nonconformity to the Cuſtom and Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I confeſs, I did a little wonder to find men make that a Rule of Conſcience, (and boldly rely and practiſe upon it) which they do not at all underſtand; to find this Weapon put into the hands of ordinary and illiterate perſons, not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt the Commands of their lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and thoſe who are ſet over them by God to be their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Guides, (in all ſuch caſes eſpecially where they are not able to guide and direct themſelves) but alſo to wound and murder the Reputation of the National Church, as degenerate from all Antiquity, as introducing and impoſing novel Cuſtoms and Ceremonies repugnant to the Principles and Practices of the firſt and pureſt Ages.</p>
                           <p>Whether it be well done in Nonconforming Miniſters to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the common people with ſuch kind of Arguments as theſe, ſo much out of their way, and above their pitch and capacity, I leave the honeſt part of the world to judge.</p>
                           <p>The (2) thing I would premiſe is this: Suppoſing Kneeling
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:634"/> at the Sacrament was never uſed by the ancient Church, yet ſuch an Objection is a wretched Plea in the mouth of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter to juſtifie his Nonconformity by as to this particular Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
                           <p>For if Kneeling be a crime and unlawful becauſe it was not uſed in Primitive times, Sitting at the Sacrament is a much greater; for that was condemned as an irreverend Poſture, as will appear by and by. Beſides, they themſelves have a very little value for Antiquity, and in all things almoſt run counter to it.</p>
                           <p>And one would think that they ſhould be very willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Kneeling, for that very reaſon which they produce againſt it; that is, becauſe it is contrary to the currant practice of all Antiquity, as they would make their Party to believe. This might be expected from them, becauſe they will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by any means or entreaties to comply with ſuch Cuſtoms and Ceremonies of our Church as were undoubtedly uſed by the ancient Chriſtians: (ſuch as <hi>God-fathers and God-mothers, the Croſs in Baptiſm, the Ring in Marriage,</hi> the Feaſts or Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days of <hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> &amp;c.) but inſtead of Conformity to theſe things, they raiſe an Hue and Cry upon the Church as Popiſh and Anti-chriſtian for enjoyning ſuch Ceremonies, and pretend they had much rather endure any extremity, than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Necks to ſuch an intolerable Yoak. But how hard is the Government put to it to pleaſe ſuch humourſome perſons! When our Governours tread in the very ſteps of the Primitive Biſhops and bleſſed Martyrs, then they are Popiſh and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and the Conſciences of our diſſenting Brethren will not ſuffer them to conform; and at other times they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, becauſe they require them to do what was never requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nor practiſed in the Church of Chriſt throughout all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Generations, till Tranſubſtantiation was eſtabliſhed in the World. So that to follow Antiquity is a great Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conformity at ſome times, and not to follow it, as great at others: When ever they pleaſe to make it ſo, it is ſo, ſay or do what one can to the contrary. Thus much concerning the Caſe in general: Let us now ſee the meaning of that Phraſe, <hi>The firſt and pureſt Ages.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This, I think, may be eaſily made out, from the Writings of thoſe men who have ſtoutly defended Sitting, or a common
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:635"/> Table-Geſture; who have delivered their minds with as much clearneſs, and as roundly as one would wiſh, concerning this matter. For thus the Author of a Book formerly cited affirms, <hi>That Antiquity is wholly againſt us, and the Primitive Churches never</hi>

                              <hi>ſo much as heard of Kneeling, and the Churches ſucceeding excluded it out of their Congregations, and gave it no Entertainment for the ſpace of</hi> 1200 <hi>years. That Kneeling to receive the Sacrament, was not uſed at the Inſtitution of the Lords Supper, nor after in any Age of the Church, before the time of</hi> Honorius <hi>the Third, about the year</hi> 1220. So alſo another great Champion for ſitting writes. Didoclavius <hi>maintaineth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which none of our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">

                              <hi>are able to infringe,</hi> viz. <hi>That no Teſtimony can be produced which may evince that ever Kneeling was uſed before the time of</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius <hi>the Third.</hi> He further obſerves from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Waldenſes, That bowing of the Knees before the Hoſt was then onely enjoyned, when the opinion of Tranſubſtantiation got place.</hi> By the Practice of the Church in the firſt and pureſt Ages, I conceive they mean thus much: <hi>That from the Age wherein the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles lived, down to that wherein Tranſubſtantiation was ſet on foot, or that wherein</hi> Honorius <hi>the Third enjoyned the Adoration of the Hoſt, Kneeling in the act of Receiving the Lords Supper was never heard of nor uſed; or as one Author expreſly aſſerts it, till the year</hi> 1220. Howſoever, for ſureneſs ſake, and in order to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this matter under our preſent Conſideration, I think it will be requiſite to fix the time wherein Tranſubſtantiation was firſt broacht, as well as when it was eſtabliſht, or impoſed as an Article of Faith; and ſo too wherein the Adoration of the Hoſt was enjoyned: whereby the juſt bounds and limits will be known, beyond which we are not to paſs to fetch in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and conſequently all extravagancy will be prevented on our part, and all cavilling (if poſſible) on theirs.</p>
                           <p>As for the Time then, which we enquire after, I think we may ſafely relie on the judgment of a very Learned Prelate of our own, which he delivers after this manner. The word <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi>

Nay, that the <hi>Thing it ſelf</hi> without the <hi>Word,</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> without the <hi>Expreſſion</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved from Scripture, is ingenuouſly acknowledged by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:635"/> the moſt Learned Schoolmen, who endeavour by other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">

The firſt Authors who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this new-coyn'd word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> are <hi>Petrus Bleſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> who lived under Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, (about the year 1159) and <hi>Stephanus Eduenſis,</hi> a Biſhop whoſe Age and Writings are very doubtful. The Pope who firſt eſtabliſht this <note place="margin">An. Dom. 1215. An. Dom. 1217, or thereabouts.</note> monſtrous Doctrine by his own Arbitrary power, as an Article of Faith, was <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third. And his Succeſſor <hi>Honorius</hi> was the man who decreed <hi>Adoration</hi> to the <hi>Hoſt.</hi> The <hi>firſt Council</hi> which took notice and approved of the Papal Decree for Tranſubſtantiation, was that aſſembled at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <note place="margin">A: D. 1415.</note> 
                              <hi>Wiclif</hi> for an Heretick, becauſe among other truths he had aſſerted this: <hi>That the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains materially in the Sacrament of the Altar; and that in the ſame Sacrament no accidents of Bread ant Wine remain without a Subſtance:</hi> and for this Opinion they ordered his Body to be taken out of his Grave, and burnt to aſhes.

                           </p>
                           <p>As for the Doctrine of <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> and the Corporal preſence of Chriſt at, with, and in the Sacrament, it was ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long before that of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and was much diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among learned men.

                           <p>As to the time then wherein we are to contain this Diſcourſe, it ſhall be the firſt 700 years after Chriſt; and to Authors onely that liv'd within that compaſs, I will appeal for evidence in the matter under diſpute: and ſurely our Diſſenting Brethren will allow that they lived in the firſt and pureſt Ages, becauſe they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:636"/> were dead before the Doctrines either of <hi>Conſubſtantiation</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were hatcht, much leſs received or eſtabliſht in the World.</p>
                           <p>If I would take all the advantage that our Adverſaries give us, I need not confine my ſelf within ſo narrow a compaſs. For they challenge us to produce one inſtance for Kneeling before the days of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third, who lived 1220 or thereabouts; and confidently affirm Kneeling was never heard of nor uſed for 1200 years after Chriſt. I hope therefore they will not complain of foul dealing, or that I ſtrain the point, ſince I give away 500 years, wherein the pure ancient Catholick Faith touching the Holy Sacrament began to decline, and was by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arts and tricks at laſt foully corrupted. Which piece of liberality I need not have exerciſed, but that I deſign purely to convince, not to contend. Let us therefore bring this matter under examination, and ſee what the practice of the Church was within the compaſs of 700 years after Chriſt; or, which is all one, in the firſt and pureſt Ages. And what I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of Antiquity, may be conveniently placed under theſe two general Heads, according to the method propoſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                           <p n="1">(1) That notwithſtanding ſeveral Nonconformiſts, well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of for Learning, have in their Writings boldly aſſerted Kneeling to be contrary to all Antiquity; it is highly probable the Primitive Chriſtians did Kneel in the act of Receiving, as the Cuſtom is in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">(2) It's certain they uſed an Adoring poſture.</p>
                           <p>As to the firſt, I hope I ſhall be able to make it good by this following Account which I ſhall give with all poſſible plainneſs and ſincerity. And I declare beforehand to all the World, that I will offer nothing for ſatisfaction to others, which I do not think in my Conſcience to be true; and that I would not uſe a Fallacy to ſerve the Cauſe, though I were ſure it could never be detected by any of our Separating Brethren. In the firſt place, for the firſt Century or 100 years wherein our Lord and his Apoſtles lived, the Scripture hath left us in the dark, and under great uncertainty what the particular Geſture was which they uſed at the Inſtitution and Celebration of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:637"/> which I think I have ſufficiently evinced in my Anſwers <note place="margin">Part 1. p. 17.</note> to the firſt and ſecond Query.</p>
                           <p>In the next place, I deſire thoſe who urge a common Table-geſture, and particularly Sitting (which was a uſual poſture at Meals among thoſe Eaſtern Nations as well as among us now) to obſerve, that Sitting was eſteemed a very irreverend Poſture to be uſed in the Worſhip and Service of God by the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; of which I ſhall give a few inſtances. The ancient <hi>Loadicean</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Which met under Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Neocaeſarian</hi> Synod and the firſt general Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> that is, between the years 314 and 325, as ſome learned men think; or <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 365. after the firſt general <hi>Nicaene</hi> Council, as others.</note> Synod finding great inconveniencies to ariſe from the Love-Feaſts which were kept at the ſame time with the Lords Supper, prohibited abſolutely the ſaid Feaſts, and the lying upon Couches in the Church; as their manner was of Solemnizing thoſe Feaſts. The words of the Canon are theſe: <hi>The Feaſts of Charity ought</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Can. 28.</note> 
                              <hi>not to be kept in the Lords Houſe or in the Church, neither may ye eat or make Couches in the Houſe of God.</hi> This was afterward forbidden by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and the Decrees of both theſe Provincial or National Councils were ratified by the 6th <hi>Trullan Council,</hi> and that under the pain of Excommunication: <note place="margin">Can. 74.</note> upon which in ſome time the Cuſtom dwindled to nothing.</p>
                           <p>Now the Reaſons which induced theſe holy Biſhops and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers to prohibit theſe Feaſts of Charity, and the uſe of a diſcumbing poſture upon Beds or Couches in the Houſe of God, (which was too, an ordinary Table-geſture according to the cuſtome of thoſe times) were in all probability taken from the Diſorder and Irreverence, the Animoſities and Exceſs that accompanied theſe Feaſts, and which both poor and rich were guilty of: They did not diſtinguiſh between their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and corporal Food, between the Lords Supper and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Meal; they did not <hi>diſcern the Lords Body,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks: and I am apt to think that the ſame abuſes which had crept in ſo early into the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> took notice of and reproved, continued and ſpread till the Church by her Cenſures and Decrees oppoſed the growing evil, and rooted up the cauſes of ſuch miſchievous effects.</p>
                           <p>To theſe Canons of Councils, if we adde the Teſtimony of particular Biſhops, who lived in thoſe firſt Ages, and who ſpeak not their own private ſence and Opinions, but Cuſtomes and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:637"/> Uſages of the Church in their time; we ſhall plainly diſcern that Sitting was accounted an irreverent poſture in the Worſhip of God, while they were engaged in Prayer or Praiſe, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Holy Sacrament.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who lived in the ſecond Century, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <note place="margin">Flor. Ann. D. 155.</note> ſucceeded that of the Apoſtles, ſeems to hint that the people ſate at the Sermon, and while the Leſſons were reading, when he informs us concerning the Chriſtian Aſſemblies in his <note place="margin">Apol. 2.</note> time, and the place where he lived: After the reading of the Leſſons and the exhortatory Sermon of the Biſhop, <hi>we riſe up</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all together, and ſend up our Prayers.</hi> He doth not indeed ſignifie what the particular Geſture was which they uſed at their Prayers, but it's clear enough they did not Sit; and they might Kneel, for any thing he ſaith to the contrary. For it's cuſtomary among us to ſit at the Sermon, and during the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Leſſons; and after they are ended, we may be truly ſaid to riſe up all together, and ſend up our Prayers: But if any one ſhould hence infer that we ſtood and not kneeled, he would conclude againſt the Law of the Land, and the common practice of the Church: Riſing up doth not neceſſarily imply that a man ſtands or kneels afterwards, but ſomewhat previous to both; for we generally riſe before we do either. But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſitting at the Sermon and Leſſons was uſual in thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies which this holy Father and Martyr frequented; yet in moſt other places the people were not permitted to ſit at all, not ſo much as at the Leſſons, or in Sermon-time; as appears part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from what <hi>Philoſtorgius</hi> an ancient Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <note place="margin">Hiſt.

                           <p>Again, that Sitting was eſteemed irreverent in the Worſhip <note place="margin">Floruit An. D. 198. <hi>Tertul.</hi> de Orat. c. 12. Tom. 2. p. 130. edit. Collon.

For among other vanities and ill cuſtoms taken notice of and reproved by this ancient Father, this was one, That they were wont (ſome of them) to fit at Prayer. A little further in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>Adde hereunto the ſin of</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>Thus much may ſuffice for ſatisfaction, that the ancient Church did by no means approve of Sitting, or a common Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-geſture, as fitting to be uſed in time of Divine Service, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at the reading of the Leſſons, and hearing of the Sermon; which too was onely practiſed in ſome places; for in others the people were not allowed to ſit at all in their religious Aſſemblies. Which Cuſtom is ſtill obſerved in moſt, if not all the Eaſtern Churches at this day, wherein there are no Seats erected or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the uſe of the people.</p>
                           <p>Now upon what hath been ſaid, I ſhall onely make this brief Reflection, and ſo proceed. If the Apoſtles of our Lord had (in purſuance of their Commiſſion to teach all Nations) in their Travels throughout the World, every where taught and eſtabliſhed ſitting or diſcumbing, (which were the common Table-geſtures according to the cuſtoms of thoſe Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) not onely as convenient, but as neceſſary to be uſed in order to worthy receiving the Lords Supper; it is a moſt ſtrange and unaccountable thing how there ſhould be (1) Such an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and univerſal Revolt of the Primitive Church from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the Conſtitutions of the holy Apoſtles; and then (2) Conſidering what a high value and eſteem the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had for the Apoſtles, the firſt founders of their Faith, and for all that paſſed under their names, it ſeems to me not onely highly improbable, but morally impoſſible, that ſo many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, together with their reſpective Biſhops and Paſtors dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in remote and diſtant Countries, (not biaſs'd by Faction, nor ſwayed by a ſuperiour Authority, being perfectly free and independent one upon another) ſhould unanimouſly conſent and conſpire together to introduce a novel Cuſtom into the Church of Chriſt, contrary to Apoſtolical Practice and Order; and not onely ſo, but (3) to Cenſure the practice and injunctions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely-inſpired
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:639"/> men, as indecent and unfit to be followed and obſerved in the publick Worſhip of God: and all this without the leaſt notice taken by, without any complaint or oppoſition from any particular perſon either in the then preſent or ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding generation.</p>
                           <p n="3">(3) The Primitive Church eſteemed the Holy Sacrament to be the moſt ſolemn part of Chriſtian Worſhip, as that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly challenged from them the utmoſt pitch of Devotion, and the higheſt degree of Reverence that they could poſſibly pay and expreſs either with their Souls or Bodies. This is clear, partly from thoſe Honorary Titles they beſtowed upon this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and adorn'd it with, which import the greateſt defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and the moſt awful regard imaginable; partly from that tedious <note place="margin">See part 1. p. 58.</note> and ſevere Diſcipline which ſhe exerciſed the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens and Penitents with, before ſhe admitted them into the Communion of the Faithful, and approved of them as fit to partake of the Holy Myſteries. To be admitted to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo onely as to behold it, and to be preſent at thoſe Prayers which were put up by worthy Communicants over the great Propitiatory Sacrifice, was heretofore accounted a high honour and priviledge: But to make one at this heavenly Feaſt, and to receive the pledges of our Lords love, was eſteemed the top and perfection of Chriſtianity, and the extremity of honour and happineſs that a Chriſtian is capable of in this life. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (with ſhame and reproach be it ſpoken to our ſtupidly wicked and degenerate Age) to be excluded from the Holy Communion, was look'd upon as the greateſt curſe and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that could be inflicted: and on the other hand, to be a Communicant, to have a freedom of acceſs to the Lords Table, as the greateſt bleſſing and moſt ample reward that could be propounded; the ſum of a Chriſtians hopes, the center of all his wiſhes during his abode here.</p>
                           <p n="4">(4.) For ſtanding in time of Divine Service, both at their Prayers and at the Sacrament, there are ſo many and ſo clear teſtimonies extant in pure Antiquity, that a man muſt take a great deal of pains not to ſee this truth, who is never ſo little converſant in the Records of thoſe times: and in ſuch a man it muſt be height of folly or impudence to deny it. The bare
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:639"/> aſſerting of it ſhall be ſufficient; becauſe to inſiſt upon the proof of it by an enumeration of particulars, would ſwell this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe beyond meaſure; and beſides, it would be a needleſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſince the great Patrons of ſitting, or the common Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſture, <note place="margin">

And from that clauſe in the Canon, <hi>Becauſe there are ſome which Kneel on the Lords day and in the days of Pentecoſt,</hi> &amp;c. we may with good reaſon infer, that Kneeling was the poſture that was generally uſed at other times in their religious Aſſemblies. For if Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding had been generally obſerved by all Churches in time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service at all other times as well as thoſe mentioned in the Decree, what occaſion or neceſſity had there been for ſuch an Injunction, whereby all Chriſtians were obliged to do that which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:640"/> they conſtantly and univerſally did before? There is a paſſage in the Author of the Queſtions and Anſwers in <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> which will put this matter out of doubt, and give us the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they altered their poſture on the Lords day: <hi>It is</hi>

For in his explication of that Petition in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> he expreſly tells us, <hi>that they did receive the Euchariſt every day, as the food that nouriſht them to Salvation.</hi> St. <hi>Baſil</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> who lived about 370 years after Chriſt, affirms, that in his Church they communicated <hi>four times a Week;</hi> on the <hi>Lords day, Wedneſday, Friday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday;</hi> two of which were ſtation-days, or ſet days of Faſting which were punctually obſerved by the generality of Chriſtians in thoſe times. And this I the rather note, becauſe in all probability, ſince they did receive the Sacrament on theſe days, they did not alter the Poſture of the day, but received Kneeling: For if Kneeling was adjudged by the Catholick Church an unſutable and improper poſture for times of mirth and joy, ſuch as the <hi>Lords days</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> were; and if they were thought guilty of a great irregularity, who uſed that poſture on thoſe <hi>Feſtivals;</hi> then we may reaſonably conclude, that Standing, which was the <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Poſture,</hi> was not uſed by the Catholick Church on days of <hi>Faſting and Humiliation;</hi> and that they who ſtood at their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotions on <hi>Faſting days,</hi> were as irregular as they who kneel'd on a <hi>Feſtival.</hi> And that this was really ſo, may, I think, be clearly collected from a paſſage in <hi>Tertullian</hi> to this purpoſe; <note place="margin">

                              <hi>We judge it an unlawful and impious thing</hi> (ſays he) <hi>either to Faſt or Kneel at our Devotions on the Lords day.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:641"/> and matter of much joy to this Holy Father, and the Chriſtians who lived in his days. And from hence I infer, that at other times, when they met together for publick Worſhip, (eſpecially on days of Faſting) they generally uſed Kneeling, and that at the Lords Supper, which was adminiſtred every day in the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>

                           <p>The (7th) and laſt particular which I would obſerve relating to this buſineſs, is this: That the Primitive Chriſtians received the Holy Sacrament Praying.

See Dr. <hi>Cave</hi>'s Primitive Chriſtianity c. 11. p. 347.</note> the whole action was concluded with Prayer and Thankſgiving. But that which more particularly affects the matter in hand, is, that the Miniſter uſed a Prayer at the delivery of the Sacrament
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:641"/> to each Communicant, to which every one at their receiving ſaid <hi>Amen.</hi>

                           <p>Now although it cannot be denied but that theſe Conſtitutions are in many things adulterated, yet it is allowed on the other hand, that in many things they are very ſincere, and convey to us the pure Practice of the moſt ancient times.

                           <p>From theſe plain inſtances we may ſee how cloſely our Church follows the ſteps of pure antiquity in the Form of Prayer appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be uſed by the Miniſter at the giving of the Bread and the Cup to the people; which runs thus: <hi>The Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>The Bloud of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt preſerve thy Body and Soul to everlaſting life,</hi> &amp;c. which laſt Clauſe was added by latter times, by way of explication, to that ſhort Form which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church uſed: and ſurely it's every Chriſtians intereſt, as well as his duty, to joyn with the Miniſter in ſuch a Prayer, and return a hearty <hi>Amen</hi> to it.</p>
                           <p>I will now briefly ſum up the Evidence that hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of Antiquity in juſtification of Kneeling at the Holy Communion, according to the cuſtom and practice of our Church; and obſerve where it directs us to fix, and what to reſolve upon. And in this order it lies: Sitting was adjudged by the ancient Catholick Church a very unfit and irreverent poſture to be uſed in time of Divine Service, when they were ſolemnly engaged in the Worſhip of God; the Holy Sacrament was eſteemed the moſt ſolemn Act or Branch of Chriſtian Worſhip; The Primitive Chriſtians generally uſed ſtanding at their publick Devotions, onely on the Lords days, and all that ſpace of time that falls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſunday;</hi> At all other times in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſemblies Kneeling was their Worſhipping poſture; and they were wont to meet and receive the Lords Supper every day, and particularly on their ſtated Weekly Faſts, which they kept every <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> when to ſtand was thought as great an irregularity, as to kneel was on the Lords day: And laſtly, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:642"/> Holy Sacrament was delivered and received with a Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that on thoſe days when they conſtantly prayed Kneeling. All theſe things therefore being conſidered, I think the leaſt that can be concluded from them, is what I aſſerted and deſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> that in all likelihood the Primitive Chriſtians did kneel at the Holy Communion, as the Cuſtom is in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> For ſitting was generally condemned as an indecent and irreverent Geſture by the Primitive Church; and no man in his wits will ſay that proſtration or lying flat upon the ground was ever uſed in the act of receiving, or ever fit to be ſo: it muſt be therefore one of theſe two; either Standing or Kneeling.</p>
                           <p>As for Standing all the time of publick Worſhip which was uſed onely on the Lords day and in Pentecoſt, the reaſon thereof was drawn not from the Sacrament, but from the day and feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſeaſon, when they did more particularly Communicate the Reſurrection of our bleſſed Saviour, openly teſtified their belief of that great Article; at ſuch times therefore they choſe ſtanding, as being a geſture ſutable to the preſent occaſion, and as an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem and ſign of the Reſurrection.</p>
                           <p>And from hence I gather, that on their common and ordinary days (when there was no peculiar reaſon to invite or oblige them to ſtand at the Sacrament) in all likelyhood they uſed Kneeling, that is, the ordinary poſture. They uſed one and the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture <hi>(viz. Standing)</hi> both at their Prayers and at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Lords day, and for fifty days after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> contrary to what was uſual at other times; and why then ſhould any man think they did not obſerve one and the ſame poſture at all other times? <hi>viz.</hi> that as at ſuch times they did conſtantly Kneel at their Prayers, ſo they did alſo conſtantly Kneel at the Sacrament, which was given and received in a Prayer.</p>
                           <p>From the ſtrength of theſe Premiſes, I may howſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my ſelf thus much ſucceſs: That whoſoever ſhall carefully weigh and peruſe them with a teachable and unprejudiced mind, ſhall find himſelf much more inclin'd to believe the Primitive Church uſed at ſome times to Kneel (as we do) at the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, than that they never did Kneel at all, or that ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was never uſed nor heard of, but excluded from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, as ſome great advocates for Sitting have confidently proclaimed it to the World.</p>
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:643"/>
                           <p>(2.) But ſecondly, Suppoſe they never did Kneel as we do, yet this is moſt certain, that they received the Lords Supper in an adoring poſture; which is the ſame thing, and will ſufficiently juſtifie the preſent practice of our Church, as being agreeable to that of pure Antiquity. For the proof of this, numerous teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies both of Greek and Latine Fathers might be alledged, but I will content my ſelf (and I hope the Reader too) with a few of each ſort, which are ſo plain and expreſs, that he who will except againſt them, will alſo with the ſame face and aſſurance except againſt the Whiteneſs of Snow, and the Light of the Sun at Noon-day.</p>

I am not much concerned whether the Reader ſhall think fit to believe or cenſure the Miracle; but it's certain, that this famous Biſhop hath put it upon Record, and applauds his Siſter for the method ſhe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for her recovery, and which ſpeaks home to my purpoſe; it's clearly intimated that this pious Woman did Kneel, or uſe an adoring poſture at leaſt when ſhe eat the Sacramental Bread. And there is no doubt to be made but <hi>Gorgonia</hi> in Communicating ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame poſture that others generally did in publick: She did that in her ſickneſs, which all others were wont to do in their health when they came to the Lords Table; <hi>i. e.</hi> fall down and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:644"/> Kneel. For it is not to be imagined that at ſuch a time as this, when ſhe came to beg ſo great a Bleſſing at Gods hands in the publick Church at the Altar, ſtiled by the Ancients the Place of Prayer, ſhe would be guilty of any irregularity, and uſed a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Poſture different from what was generally uſed by Chriſtians when they came to the ſame place to Communicate and Pray o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the great Propitiatory Sacrifice; which they eſteemed the moſt powerful and effectual way of Praying, the moſt likely to render God propitious, and to prevail with him above all other Prayers which they offered at any other time, or in any other place. So much for the teſtimonies of the Greek Fathers, who were men famous for Learning and Piety in their generations, and great Lights and Ornaments in the Ancient Church.

                           <p>From theſe few Inſtances I think it appears evident, that the Primitive Chriſtians uſed an adoring poſture at the Sacrament in the act of receiving. It were eaſie to heap together many other Witneſſes, if it were neceſſary ſo to do, either to prove or clear the Cauſe in hand: but ſince there is no need, to peſter the Diſcourſe with numerous references and appeals to Antiquity, would but puzzle and obſcure the Argument, and tend in all likelihood ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confound and diſguſt, than convince and gratifie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                           <p>By what hath been alleadged, the practice of our Church in Kneeling at the Sacrament is ſufficiently juſtified, as agreeable to the Cuſtoms and Practice of pure Antiquity. For if the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did at the Sacrament uſe a poſture of Worſhip and Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (which that they did, is very plain) then Kneeling is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the practice of the Church in the firſt and pureſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; no, though we ſhould ſuppoſe that Kneeling was never pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed among them: which will appear, if we caſt our eyes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon that heavy Charge which ſome of the fierceſt but leſs prudent Adverſaries of Kneeling have drawn up againſt it. They object againſt Kneeling, as being an Adoring geſture; For they affirm, <hi>That to kneel in the act of Receiving, before the conſecrated</hi>

                              <hi>Bread and Wine, is formal Idolatry. So alſo to kneel before any Creature as a memorative object of God, though there be no intention of giving divine Adoration to that Creature, is Idolatry.</hi> Now if the Primitive Chriſtians may be ſuppoſed to proſtrate themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar upon their firſt approach thither in order to receive, or immediately after they had received the Bread and the Cup from the hand of the Miniſter; or if they bowed their Heads and Bodies after a lowly manner, in the act of Receiving; or if they received ſtanding upright, and eat and drank at the Lords Table with their Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven; then they were guilty of Idolatry, as well as we who kneel at the Sacrament, in the judgement of thoſe <hi>Scotch Caſuiſts;</hi> and conſequently, Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Holy Communion, according to the Cuſtom of our Church, is not contrary to the practice of the Church of Chriſt in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:645"/> the firſt and pureſt Ages. For all thoſe poſtures before mentioned were poſtures of Worſhip and Adoration, and uſed as ſuch by the Primitive Chriſtians: eſpecially ſtanding, which is allowed by <note place="margin">

                           <p>I will conclude all with an Inſtance in their own Caſe about a common Table-geſture. Suppoſe the Primitive Chriſtians did in ſome places receive the Holy Sacrament Sitting, or lying along upon Beds, as the ancient Cuſtom was in thoſe Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, at their common and ordinary Tables: Put the Caſe that in other places they ſate croſs-legg'd on Carpets at the Lords Supper, as the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> eat at this day; or that they received Standing in other places, according to the common mode of Feaſting; which we will ſuppoſe onely at preſent. Could any man now reaſonably object againſt the lawfulneſs of Sitting upright at the Sacrament upon a Form or Chair (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom of <hi>England)</hi> as being contrary to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Antiquity, who never ſate at all? Certainly no. For though they differ from the Ancients as to the Site of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the particular mode of Receiving, yet they all agree in this, that they receive in a common Table-geſture: They all uſe the ſame Geſture at the Sacrament, that they conſtantly uſed at their civil Feaſts and ordinary Entertainments in the ſeveral places of their abode. And ſo ſay I in the preſent Caſe; What though the Primitive Chriſtians ſtood upright ſome of them at the Sacrament, and others bowed their Heads and Bodies in the Act of Receiving, and none of them ever uſed Kneeling? Yet they and we do very well agree for all that, becauſe we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in an Adoring or Worſhipping Poſture. It is one and the ſame thing variouſly expreſt, according to the modes of different Countries.</p>

                           </list>
                           <p>As to the firſt of theſe Propoſitions, I have in my Anſwer to the fourth Query made it (I think) appear very probable, <hi>That the Church of Chriſt in the firſt and pureſt Ages did Kneel, as we do at this day, in the Act of Receiving.</hi> And if this be allowed, then they who oppoſe Kneeling will be unavoidably driven upon one of theſe two things: Either they muſt pronounce the Primitive Chriſtians guilty of Idolatry, or not guilty. If they ſay <hi>they</hi> were Idolaters, then the former Objection againſt Kneeling contained in the fourth Query is void of all ſence, and falls to the ground; <hi>viz. That Kneeling is contrary to the general practice of pure Antiquity.</hi> If they were clear from Idolatry, then the preſent Objection comes to nothing; <hi>viz. That Kneeling is unlawful, as being firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by Idolaters.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But ſecondly, to come cloſe to the Queſtion, let us try if we can find the time <hi>when,</hi> and the idolatrous perſons <hi>by whom</hi>
                              <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:646"/> Kneeling was firſt brought into practice. And ſurely there are none ſo likely to inform us, as they who raiſe the Objection; for if they do not make out theſe particulars, they talk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſay nothing to the purpoſe. And what are the clear and undeniable Proofs (for ſuch I am ſure they ought to be in this caſe) which they produce to make good this Charge againſt Kneeling? No other than theſe, that I can find by my beſt ſearch into the Writings of the moſt learned Advocates for Sitting: <hi>Kneeling in the Act of Receiving the Euchariſt was not known to the</hi>

                           <p>This is <hi>Didoclave</hi> alias <hi>Calderwood</hi> his Account; which is ſo blind and confuſed, and inconſiſtent with it ſelf, that it proves nothing, but that the Author had a great mind to ſay ſomewhat to the purpoſe, but knew not what or how. It was unknown, he ſaith, to the Church for a thouſand years; and again, not known till Tranſubſtantiation ſprung up and grew to Maturity; and again, never uſed till the time of Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> who lived about the beginning of the Thirteenth Century, and came to the Papacy in the year 1216. Now it's ſtrange to me how Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Sacrament ſhould be known about a thouſand years after Chriſt, and yet never uſed till the year 1216, or thereabouts: This is all one with ſaying, Playing upon Organs was never heard of nor known till the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, but then Organs were never play'd upon till King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown. And then again, though Kneeling was brought in by Antichriſt, it was not brought in by <hi>Honorius,</hi> but in his time onely. All the light therefore that this Author (who hath taken as much pains, and ſhewed as much Learning as any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in defence of Sitting) affords us, is onely this: That Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was brought in at ſome time or other, but he could not well tell when; and by ſomebody or other, what do ye call him; but it's uncivil to name names.</p>

What ſhifts are men put to, when they undertake to defend an ill Cauſe! Who is there ſo ignorant, as not to know that things may grow out of faſhion and uſe? What for ſome ages was a general and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Cuſtom, may in tract of time wear off, and dwindle to nothing. I need ſay no more to expoſe the weakneſs of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, than to put it thus: Sitting was not in uſe in the time of <hi>Honorius,</hi> therefore in all probability it was never in uſe in any preceding Age.</p>
                           <p>After all too, it's ſtrange that Kneeling at the Sacrament ſhould ſpring (as theſe Writers affirm) from that monſtrous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation and a Conceit of the corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, and not be in uſe in the days of <hi>Honorius</hi> when he made the Decree of Adoration. Becauſe that Doctrine had been diſputed many years before among learned men, and was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Papal authority in the year 1215, before <hi>Honorius</hi> was elected Pope. But to paſs by this, it appears from the Writings of theſe men, that they unanimouſly agree in this: Kneeling was brought in by the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> after <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> ſprung up, and in the time of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third. They all agree too, in talking confidently and at large concerning this matter, without all Reaſon or Proof to make out their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, but It is ſo, and It muſt needs be ſo, right or wrong: and the common People ſwallow all for Goſpel, and have got <hi>Honorius</hi> his name by the end, and ſo the matter is determined.</p>
                           <p>However, thus much I think is gained in favour of Kneeling, from what theſe our great Adverſaries ſay againſt it; <hi>That it was</hi>

                              <hi>not introduced by any Pope of</hi> Rome. For when they ſay the <hi>man of ſin</hi> was the Mother of Kneeling, and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> brought it in; if they mean by thoſe Phraſes (as they generally in their other Writings do) the <hi>Pope</hi> or the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the matter is out of doubt, they themſelves being Judges. Becauſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirm, that Kneeling was never practiſed before Pope <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Diſp. p. 81.</note> his time; and even then it was not inſtituted by him, but by ſomebody elſe. But if by the man of ſin and Antichriſt, they mean any number or Society of men, as the <hi>Conclave of Cardinals,</hi>

That there are none ſuch to be met with any where, I will appeal to Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> as good a Terrier as ever lived, and no Friend to Kneeling. <hi>There is not one Canon to be found</hi> (ſays he) <hi>made by any General, National, Provincial Council or</hi>

And this <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burg.</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Kneel. p. 67.</note> I deſire may be remembred, againſt we come to diſcourſe on the ſecond Head, <hi>viz.</hi> that Kneeling is not therefore ſinful, becauſe it is uſed by Idolaters.</p>
                           <p>If any ſhould after all put the Queſtion thus to me: When is it, ſay you, that Kneeling firſt commenced in the World; by whoſe means, and upon what reaſons? my plain Anſwer is, I cannot cerntainly tell; nor can I find any account thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ancient Records. But this is no Argument <hi>againſt,</hi> but rather <hi>for</hi> the ancient and univerſal uſe of this Geſture: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Cuſtoms are eaſily traced to their Originals, but generally the moſt ancient Uſages of every Country are without Father and Mother; and we cannot tell from what ſource they are derived.</p>
                           <p>(2.) I am ſo far from thinking (as our Diſſenting Brethren do) that Kneeling owes its birth to the Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, that I verily believe the contrary: <hi>viz.</hi> Kneeling, or an adoring poſture uſed by the ancient Chriſtians in the Act of Receiving, did very much (among other things) conduce to beget and nurſe up in the minds of Superſtitious and Phanciful men, a Conceit, that Chriſt was really and corporally preſent at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; which Notion, by ſubtil and inquiſitive heads, was in a little time improved and explained after this manner: That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Elements of Bread and Wine were conſecrated, they were thereby changed into the ſubſtance of Chriſts natural Body and Bloud. This I am ſure of, that the Patrons of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did very early make uſe of this very Argument, to prove that they taught and believed no more than what the Primitive Biſhops and Chriſtians did. For what elſe could they intend or mean (ſay they) by that extraordinary Reverence and Devotion which they manifeſted when they received the dreadful Myſteries (as they called the Bread and Wine) if they were bare and empty ſigns onely, and not changed into the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt? which is in effect the very Argument uſed by <note place="margin">Caſſa enim videtur tot hominum huic Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento miniſtrantium vel adorantium veneran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ſedulitas, niſi ipſius Sacramenti longe major crederetur, quam videretur veritas &amp; utilitas; cum ergo exterius, quaſi nulla ſint quibus tanta impenduntur venerationis obſequia, aut inſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſumus, aut ad intima mittimus magna ſalutis myſteria. <hi>Alger.</hi> de Sacramentis, lib. 2. c. 3.</note>

                              <hi>Coſter,</hi> another Popiſh Writer, is ſo far from ſaying the Pope introduced it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:648"/> and that after Tranſubſtantiation took place, that he reſolves it into an ancient Cuſtom continued from the Apoſtles times.</p>
                           <p>Seeing then upon the whole matter it appears by the confeſſion of ſome who oppoſe Kneeling that <hi>Honorius</hi> did not inſtitute or ordain that Geſture in the Act of Receiving; ſeeing the Decree which he made, and which others appeal to, doth not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to this matter, but onely to the Adoration of the Hoſt at the Prieſts elevation of it; ſeeing no other Pope is alledged as the Author of this Cuſtom; ſeeing Kneeling was never any inſtituted Ceremony in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor is there any Canon or Decree or Rubrick extant which requires the uſe of that Geſture; ſeeing the Pope himſelf, and the Prieſts who celebrate, uſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Geſture in the Act of Receiving; ſeeing their own Writers look on it as an ancient Uſage derived to them from the firſt and pureſt Ages: it follows, that what is pretended and ſuppoſed in the Queſtion, is without all Warrant and Proof, <hi>viz.</hi> that Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Act of Receiving was firſt brought in by Idolaters.</p>
                           <p>And now to cloſe up all, I will appeal to any man of ſenſe and underſtanding, whether this be not a very ſilly and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant way of Arguing? Kneeling in the Act of Receiving is ſinful, becauſe it was firſt introduced by <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> and that after the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was ſtarted and took place in the world; and yet after all (when you come up cloſe to them, and enquire into particulars) they are not able to date the original of it, nor name the Authors who firſt invented it and ſet it up. At this rate of talking, it were the eaſieſt matter ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to evince that Sitting and Standing were equally unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with Kneeling. For it is but affirming boldly that they were firſt brought in and uſed by <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and then the work is done effectually. And if ſuch ſlender Objections muſt drive us away from the Lords Supper, we ſhall never communicate as long as we live.</p>
                           <p>But beſides the folly of ſuch Arguments, I think it's a very wicked thing for men to invent and urge them, as the Caſe ſtands with us at preſent: For what is there more deſired and wiſht for by all good Chriſtians, than Brotherly Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord? than that we may all meet together with one accord, in one place, and with one mind and one mouth glorifie God in the publick Churches? What more talkt of now adays then <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion?</hi> Whoſoever therefore ſhall any ways obſtruct ſo bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:649"/> and deſirable a Work, muſt be concluded every ill man. And ſuch a one (moſt certainly) is he (whatſoever we may think of it) who withdraws himſelf from the Holy Communion upon groundleſs jealouſies and unreaſonable fears of incurring the divine diſpleaſure, if he receive Kneeling; and ſhall go about by the Bugbear-words of <hi>Idolaters, Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> to ſcare weak and honeſt men from Receiving the Holy Sacrament in our Churches. Becauſe the Lords Supper was inſtituted for this peculiar end, among others, <hi>viz.</hi> to be an uniting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to bind Chriſtians together in the ſtricteſt bonds of Love and Friendſhip, to diſpoſe and engage them to put on Bowels of Mercy, to exerciſe the moſt kind and tender affections, and the moſt fervent Charity one towards another that is poſſible for men to do. Thoſe Nonconforming Miniſters therefore who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the people with theſe Arguments (which they themſelves know, unleſs they be groſly ignorant, to be falſe and ſenceleſs) to render them averſe from the Lords Supper as it is adminiſtred in our Churches, are in plain Engliſh the <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Fomenters</hi> of our <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and the <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of our <hi>Peace.</hi>

                           <p>All that I ſhall do therefore at preſent, is onely this, briefly to propound my Reaſons for the proof of my Aſſertion; by which I hope to make it evidently appear, that our Diſſenting Brethren lie under a great errour and miſtake, by thinking that all thoſe Rites and Ceremonies which are in themſelves indifferent, and of mans deviſing, ought to be utterly aboliſhed; and become ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to uſe, purely becauſe they either have been, or are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly abuſed to Idolatry. But here a few things muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, to prevent Cavils and Miſtakes.</p>
                           <p n="1">(1.) I take it for granted, that indifferent things may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">See the Caſe of Indifferent Things.</note> uſed in the Worſhip of God. This is ſuppoſed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Queſtion; for otherwiſe it would be ſinful in us to Kneel, whether that Geſture had been ever uſed or abuſed by Idolaters or no.</p>
                           <p n="2">(2.) I grant that the Worſhip of God is to be preſerved pure <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Fal.</hi> lib.

To fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Idolaters in what they think or do amiſs, to follow them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in what they do, without other reaſon than onely the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                           <p>But excepting theſe Caſes, it is not ſinful or blame-worthy in any Society of Chriſtians to agree with Idolaters in Opinion or Practice, and to uſe the ſame Rites which they abuſe. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, our Church is not to be blamed or charged with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, for her Agreement with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in uſing the ſame Ceremonies, unleſs it can be proved that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth abuſe the ſaid Ceremonies to ſinful ends; or that the Ceremonies uſed and appointed by our Church, naturally tend to promote the Corruptions practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and were ill deſigned; or that ſhe did not follow the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules of Gods Word, the Directions of the Holy Ghoſt in appointing and enjoyning the uſe of Ceremonies, as being godly, comely, profitable; but overlooking all this, had an eye purely to the Example of Idolatrous Papiſts in what they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs.</p>
                           <p>Now this I am ſure can never be made good againſt our Church, who hath ſufficiently vindicated her ſelf, by the open declarations ſhe hath printed to the World, from all accuſations of this nature. Let but any man conſult the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Art. 20. Art. 34. Canon. 18.</note> the <hi>Preface</hi> to the Book of Common-Prayer juſt after the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> the two excellent Diſcourſes that follow it <hi>concening the Service of the Church</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and the Reaſons ſhe hath publiſht at the end of the Communion-ſervice for enjoyning her Communicants to receive Kneeling; I ſay, let any man peruſe theſe, and he will receive ample ſatisfaction, that our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in Church and State in appointing the uſe of Ceremonies did not ſteer by the Example of Idolaters, nor enjoyn them out of any ill deſign, or to any ill ends; but were conducted by the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of the holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of pure <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I proceed to prove this Aſſertion: <hi>That it is not ſinful to uſe ſuch Things and Rites as either have been or are notoriouſly abuſed to Idolatry:</hi> Or, which is all one, <hi>That to Kneel in the Act of Receiving according to the cuſtom of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is not therefore ſinful, becauſe it hath been and is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abuſed to Idolatry,</hi> for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52190:650"/>
                           <p n="1">(1.) In general: No abuſe of any Geſture, though it be in the moſt manifeſt Idolatry, doth render that Geſture ſimply evil, and for ever after unlawful to be uſed in the Worſhip of God upon that account. For the abuſe of a thing ſuppoſes the lawful uſe of it; and if any thing otherwiſe lawful becomes ſinful by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of it, then it's plain that it is not in its own nature ſinful, but by accident, and with reſpect to ſomewhat elſe. This is clear from Scripture: for if Rites and Ceremonies, after they have been abuſed by Idolaters, become abſolutely evil, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be uſed at all, then the Jews ſinned in <hi>offering Sacrifice,</hi> erecting <hi>Altars,</hi> burning <hi>Incenſe</hi> to the God of Heaven, <hi>bowing down</hi> themſelves before him, wearing a <hi>Linnen Garment</hi> in the time of Divine Worſhip, and obſerving other Things and Rites which the Heathens obſerved in the Worſhip of their falſe Gods.</p>
                           <p>No (ſay the Diſſenters) we except all ſuch Rites as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or approved of by God, and ſuch are all thoſe fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But, ſay I, it's a ſilly Exception, and avails nothing. For if the abuſe of a thing to Idolatry makes it abſolutely ſinful, and unlawful to be uſed at all, then it's impoſſible to deſtroy that Relation; and what hath been once abuſed, muſt ever remain ſo: that is, an infinite power can't undo what hath been done, and clear it from ever having been abuſed. And therefore I conclude from the Command and Approbation of God, that a bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with Idolaters in uſing thoſe Rites in the Worſhip of the true God, which they practice in the Worſhip of Idols, is not ſimply ſinful, or formal Idolatry; for if it had, God had obliged the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his expreſs Command to commit ſin, and to do what he ſtrictly and ſeverely prohibited in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In truth, ſuch a Poſition would plainly make God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin.</p>
                           <p n="2">(2.) This Poſition, <hi>That the Idolatrous abuſe of any thing, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the uſe of it ſinful to all that know it,</hi> is attended with very miſchievous conſequences and effects.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> It intrenches greatly upon Chriſtian liberty, as dear to our Diſſenting Brethren as the Apple of their Eyes: and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are not ſenſible of it. At other times they affirm that no earthly power can rightly reſtrain the uſe of thoſe things which God hath left free and indifferent; and that thoſe things which otherwiſe are lawful, become ſinful when impoſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52190:651"/> by lawful Authority: and yet theſe very men give that power to <hi>Strangers,</hi> both <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which they take away from their own <hi>rightful Princes</hi> and <hi>lawful Superiours.</hi> An Idolater may yoke them, when a Proteſtant Prince muſt not touch them. And what more heavy and intolerable Yoke can be clapt on our necks than this, That another mans abuſe of any thing to Idolatry, though in its own nature indifferent, and left free by God, renders the uſe of it ſinful? Whether this be not a violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtian Liberty, let St. <hi>Paul</hi> determine; who tells us, that <hi>to the pure all things are pure;</hi> and affirms it lawful to eat of ſuch things as had been offered to Idols, and <hi>to eat whatſoever was</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 25, 27, 28, 29.</note> 
                              <hi>ſold in the ſhambles.</hi> And what reaſon is there why a Geſture ſhould be more defiled by Idolaters, than Meat which they had offered up in Sacrifice to Idols? and why ſhould one be ſinful and idolatrous to uſe, and not the other? Certainly St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have granted them ſuch a priviledge, if he judged it idolatrous to uſe what Idolaters had abuſed; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he in the ſame Chapter exhorts them earneſtly to <hi>flee from Idolatry.</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Poſition ſubjects the minds of Chriſtians to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Scruples and Perplexities, and naturally tends to reduce us to ſuch a ſtate and condition in which both the Jews and Gentiles were, before the glorious light of the Goſpel broke out upon the World: that is, it tends to beget and propagate a baſe ſervile tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition towards God, and to fill us with fears &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings when we are engaged in his Worſhip and Service. Whereas the true and great deſign of the Goſpel, is to breed in men a filial cheerful frame of heart, the <hi>ſpirit of Love, and of a ſound</hi> or quiet <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. 2 Tim. 1. 7.</note> 
                              <hi>mind;</hi> to give us a free, eaſie, comfortable acceſs to God as to our Father, and to encourage every good man to a diligent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, frequent attendance upon the duties of his Worſhip, by the pleaſure and delight that follows them. But now if nothing may be uſed by us without highly offending God, that either hath been or is abuſed to Idolatry; who ſees not what trouble and diſtraction will ariſe in our minds hereupon, when we meet together to worſhip God? It's well known that moſt of our <hi>Churches</hi> were erected by <hi>Idolatrous Papiſts,</hi> and as much defiled by Idolatry as any Geſture can be; they are dedicated to ſeveral <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> whoſe Images were once ſet up and adored. Our <hi>Bells, Pews, Fonts, Desks, Church-yards,</hi> have been conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:651"/> after a ſuperſtitious manner; many <hi>Cups, Flagons, Diſhes, Communion-Tables,</hi> have been given and uſed by Idolaters. What now is to be done? If Kneeling at the Sacrament be ſinful, becauſe it hath been abuſed by Idolaters notoriouſly; ſo alſo it is ſinful to uſe any other Thing or Rite that hath, if it be of mans diviſing, as the afore-mentioned Writers limit the Queſtion. If Sitting were allowed by Authority, we could not come to the publick Churches, nor to the Sacrament, nor chriſten our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for all that, if we know the Font and other Utenſils of the Church were once abuſed to Idolatry by Papiſts: We muſt firſt make a diligent ſearch, and if certain information cannot be had, we can't Worſhip God in publick without panick fears and great diſquiet of mind.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such a Poſition as this will deſtroy all Publick Worſhip. For if nothing muſt be uſed which hath been or is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by Idolaters, it will be in the power of Idolaters, by ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the outward marks and ſigns of that inward veneration and eſteem which we owe to God, to ſmother our Devotions, ſo as they ſhall never appear in the World; and by that means fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the very end and deſign of Religious Aſſemblies. And truly this work is already, by the ſtrength of this Principle, very well effected. For <hi>Kneeling</hi> at Prayers, and <hi>Standing</hi> and <hi>Sitting,</hi> and lifting up the hands and eyes to Heaven, and bowing of the body, together with Prayer and Praiſe, and Singing, have been all notoriouſly abuſed to Idolatry, and are ſo at this day.</p>
                           <p>I know how it will be replied, that they except ſuch things as <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                              </label> are neceſſary to be uſed in the Service of God; it's abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we worſhip God, and do him publick Honour; and whatſoever is neceſſary in order to this, may lawfully be uſed by us without ſin, though the ſame geſtures and ſigns of Adoration are uſed and abuſed by Idolaters.</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, That this is cunningly, but not honeſtly and <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                              </label> truly ſaid. For the Reaſons they give to prove that it is ſinful to uſe the ſame Rites and Ceremonies with Idolaters at any time, prove it ſo at all times, and make it for ever ſo. So long as the Reaſons hold to make any thing ſinful, ſo long it is ſo. If the uſe or abuſe of any thing by Idolaters make it ſimply evil, then it muſt for ever remain ſo; and no neceſſity whatſoever can take it off, and make it lawful and innocent. If ſuch Things and <note place="margin">See <hi>Gillesp.</hi> p. 128.</note> Ceremonies which are or have been abuſed to Idolatry, become
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:652"/> ſinful in theſe by reſpects, and for theſe reaſons, <hi>viz. Becauſe they</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1. Reductive, 2. Participative:</note> 
                              <hi>put us in mind of Idolatry, and preſerve the memory of Idols:</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Becauſe they move us to turn back to Idolatry, and ſort us with Idolaters:</hi> then it will be ever ſinful for us to uſe them. <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Quia Monent, Quia Movent.</hi> 134. 149.</note> For theſe Reaſons will hold good in things that are of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary uſe in the Church, as well as in things that are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: that is, nothing can hinder and deſtroy theſe effects; they will ever mind us of, and move us to Idolatry. And from hence I conclude that this Principle is a very falſe one, and ought to be laid aſide. For it is attended with this abſurdity: It obliges us utterly to aboliſh, and forbids the uſe of all ſuch Rites as have been notoriouſly abuſed to Idolatry in ſome caſes, for reaſons which eternally hold in all. So that at laſt it drives us into ſuch ſtreights, that we muſt ſin one way or other. For either we muſt not worſhip God in publick, or we muſt be guilty of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Gillesp.</hi> c. 3. p. 149.</note> if we do: And though of two Evils or Calamities the leaſt is to be choſen, yet of two Sins neither is. Chriſtian Religion flows from infinite Wiſdom; and the Laws of God do not croſs one another, but are even and conſiſtent. We are never caſt by God under a neceſſity of ſinning, of tranſgreſſing one Law by the obſervance of another; but thus it muſt be, if we take up and ſtick to this Principle.</p>
                           <p n="3">(3.) Our Diſſenting Brethren condemn themſelves in what they allow and practiſe, by the ſame Rule by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Kneeling at the Sacrament, and other Rites of our Church. For they themſelves did uſe, without Scruple, ſuch <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Poſtures</hi> as had been defiled and abuſed by <hi>Idolaters.</hi> They were wont to be bare-headed in time of Divine Worſhip, at Prayer, and at the Sacrament: and ſo do Idolatrous Papiſts: they never affirmed that it was ſinful to Kneel at our Prayers both publick and private; yet this Geſture the Papiſts uſe in their Prayers to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> They uſed our Churches, Church-yards, and Bells, and never thought they ſinn'd againſt God by ſo doing, though they knew <note place="margin">Direct. of the day and place of Worſhip.</note> they had been abuſed. Nay, the <hi>Directory</hi> declares, <hi>That ſuch places are not ſubject to any ſuch Pollution by any Superſtition former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed and now laid aſide, as may render them unlawful and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</hi>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:652"/> this judicious Remark: The pretence of their convenient uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would be no better Excuſe on their behalf, than was that Plea for ſparing the beſt of the <hi>Antalekites</hi> Cattel that they might be a Sacrifice, when God had devoted them to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if God (as they ſay) hath commanded that all ſuch Things and Rites ſhould be utterly aboliſhed as were of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, and had been abuſed to Idolatry; then the convenient uſefulneſs of ſuch Places and Things will never bear them out.</p>
                           <p n="4">(4) If it be ſinful to Kneel at the Sacrament becauſe that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture hath been and is notoriouſly abuſed by Papiſts to idolatrous ends, ſo alſo is Sitting, which is contended for with ſo much ſhew of Zeal. For the Pope himſelf ſits in the Act of Receiving, as was before noted; and (if any credit be to be given to a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> for the ſame reaſon which our Diſſenters urge for Sitting, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Apoſtles ſate at the firſt Inſtitution and Celebration of the Sacrament. <hi>If any enquire why the</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>To conclude; If Kneeling be unlawful becauſe it hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to Idolatry, then we muſt never Receive the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For we muſt Receive in ſome convenient Poſture, ſuch as <hi>Kneeling, Sitting, Diſcumbing, Standing;</hi> and yet every one of theſe either have been or is notoriouſly abuſed by Heathens and Papiſts to Idolatrous ends.</p>
                           <p>I have now finiſht what I undertook; and endeavoured, all that in me lies, to ſatisfie all honeſt and peaceable Diſſenters that they may lawfully and innocently Kneel in the Act of Receiving the Holy Sacrament. What Succeſs this Diſcourſe will have, I know not; but this I am ſure of, it is well meant; and if it be <hi>read</hi> with the ſame <hi>Charity</hi> as it was <hi>written,</hi> with an <hi>honeſt teachable mind,</hi> a mind not pleaſed with its Scruples, I hope by Gods bleſſing it will do ſome good in the World. And really if any of our Diſſenting Brethren ſhall Receive thus much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from what I have written, That by Kneeling in the Act of Receiving, they tranſgreſs no known <hi>Law of God,</hi> nor act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our bleſſed Saviours <hi>Example;</hi> That they do nothing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:653"/> but what becomes them, and is very ſutable to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> nothing but what is agreeable to the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>univerſal Church</hi> in the firſt and pureſt Ages; I don't ſee what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scruples about Kneeling ſhould block up their way to the Lords Table, and hinder them from communicating with us. There are a ſort of men, I confeſs, who ſeparate from our Church, upon whom I deſpair of doing good by any attempts of this nature; and they are ſuch whoſe Scruples ariſe from a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principle, not from the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of their underſtandings, but the <hi>obſtinacy</hi> of their wills; not from a great fear of offending God which keeps pace with all their actions (for ſuch I have as tender a compaſſion as any man) but from <hi>Humour, Self-Conceit, Affectation of popular Applauſe</hi> and the being thought the wiſer and better men, for finding fault with every thing enjoyned by lawful Authority, and every thing that is written in defence of it: Nor upon men whoſe Scruples againſt <hi>Government by Biſhops,</hi> the <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> ariſe, not from their <hi>Conſciences</hi> but their <hi>Stomachs</hi> from <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> from private <hi>piques</hi> &amp; <hi>diſappointments</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> from <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> when the more they rail and except againſt Ceremonies, the better Trade they drive in the World.

                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>WHether it is lawful for any Man to forſake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and go to the ſeparate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe he can better Edifie there?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is Unlawful.</p>
                        <p>To make this plain, two things muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> What ſort of Perſon this is, who asks this Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> What he means by Edification.</p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:656"/>
                        <p>As to the Perſon, he is ſuppos'd to be one, that is fully ſatisfied, that he may lawfully Communicate with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> That there are no Terms of Communion put upon him, but which he can comply withal with a good Conſcience; That there is nothing in it contrary to the Word of God, natural Reaſon, or plain Conſequences fetcht from both or either. And therefore he who thinks, that there are ſome things unlawful in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not concern'd in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for he ſeparates upon the Account of Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and not Edification onely, as is ſuppos'd in the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, By Edification is meant, an Improvement of his Spiritual Condition in the full latitude, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it may truly conſiſt; whether in the Articles of his Faith, which in the ſeparate Congregations are better taught, more clearly prov'd, more fitly appli'd to his practice, and to ſupport his hopes of Heaven; or whether in the Rules of Life, which are there more exactly laid down, and more ſtrongly enforc'd upon his Mind; or in Prayers, which among them are better compos'd, and more fervently ſent up unto God; and in all other parts of Devotion, which there are better fram'd and order'd to affect his Soul, and make a truly Chriſtian man.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two things being explain'd, and premis'd, the Anſwer to the Queſtion will be found true, if we conſider theſe following Reaſons:</p>
                        <p>1. That the Ground upon which the Queſtion ſtands is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> There is not better Edification to be had in the Separate Meetings, than in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This will appear, if we conſider,</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. How apt and fit the whole Conſtitution of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:656"/> Church of <hi>England</hi> is to Edifie Mens Souls.</item>
                           <item>2. That this Conſtitution is well us'd and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, by the Paſtors of our Church, for Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The firſt will be manifeſt by Induction, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſeveral parts of her Conſtitution, reducible to theſe following Heads:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Her Creeds or Articles of Faith are thoſe which our Diſſenters themſelves allow; which are full and plain, containing all Neceſſaries and Fundamentals in Religion; nothing defective in Vitals or Integrals, to make up the Body of a true Chriſtian Church. Chriſt that founded his Church, beſt knew what was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to her being; and there is nothing that he hath declar'd to be ſo, but is contain'd in her Creeds. Whatever is fundamental for us to know of the Nature of God, is to be found there, or by eaſie Conſequences deduced from them. Would we know what we ought to believe of the Nature of Chriſt or his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Deſigns of his coming upon Earth, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his Reign and Government, the Rewards and Puniſhments of his Laws, the Times of Account and Retribution, the mighty Miracles and extraordinary Acts of Providence to confirm theſe; we may read them at large in Holy Writ, and find wiſely ſumm'd up in our Creeds. Whoſe Articles, to help the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of Men, are ſhort and few; and to aſſiſt the dulneſs of their Underſtandings, are manifeſt and plain; they containing no more, than what was ſome way or other, either ſuppos'd before, or included in, or following from that brief Creed, <hi>the Character of a true Chriſtian,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus is the Christ, the Son of God.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 John 4. 15. 5. 5.</note> Whatever is any way reveal'd by God as neceſſary, is an Article of our Faith: nothing that is nice and obſcure, fit onely for diſpute and wrangling, is brought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:657"/> into our Creed; all whoſe Articles are Primitive, and of Divine right; none of them purely ſpeculative or curious, but plain and uſeful in order to practice, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally leading to an Holy Life, the end of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. We love every thing that is truly ancient and Apoſtolical, but we cannot call that an eternal truth, which was but yeſterday; and we are ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all truth, but we cannot call that the High-Prieſt, which is but the Fringe of his Garment. We believe all that the early Chriſtians in the firſt 300 Years thought ſufficient for them to know (and they were very ſecure that this would ſave them.) And if any truth be diſguis'd or defac'd by the iniquity of the deſcending Ages, we are ready to receive it, whenever it is made clear, and reſtor'd to its former ſhape and complexion; we caſting out obſtinacy and perverſneſs out of our Practice, as well as niceneſs out of our Creed. That Creed that Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught, the Saints, Martyrs, and Confeſſors, the Wiſe and Good Men in the firſt and pureſt days of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity believ'd, and were ſecure of Heaven by it, and therefore added no more; that Faith this Church main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which will ſufficiently and effectually Edifie the Souls of Men.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Neceſſity ſhe lays upon a Good Life and Works. For this is the ſolemn intention of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, our Creed, our Prayers, our Sacraments, and Diſcipline, and all Devotion. Her Creed is ſuch, that all its Articles ſo directly, or by natural conſequence, lead unto Virtue and Holineſs, that no man can firmly believe them, but they muſt ordinarily influence his Manners, and better his Converſation; and if by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Creed his Life is not mended, he either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly and groſly miſtakes their Conſequences, or is wilfully deſperate. Our Church publickly declares,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:657"/> that without preparatory Virtues, no Acts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however ſet off with Zeal and Paſſion, are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God; and if obedience be wanting afterwards, are but ſcene and ſhow. Such a Faith ſhe lays down as fundamental to ſalvation, which reſts not in the brain and ſtory, in magnifying and praiſing, in ſighing and repeating, but in the production of Mercy, Charity, and Juſtice, and ſuch excellent Virtues. She makes no debates between Faith and Good Works, nor argues nicely about the preference, nor diſputes critically the Mode how joyntly they become the condition of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but plainly determines, that without Faith and Good Works, no Man ſhall ſee God. She not onely keeps to a Form of ſound Words, but to a Converſation of equal Firmneſs and Solidity. Her Feſtivals are to commemorate the Virtues of Excellent Men, and to recommend them as Preſidents for imitation. Her Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which were principally deſign'd for Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may alſo remind us of thoſe Virtues which become the <hi>Worſhippers of God.</hi> Her Collects and Petitions are for Grace to ſubdue our Follies, and to fortifie our reſolutions for Holineſs. Her diſcipline is to laſh the ſturdy into Sobriety and Goodneſs: And her Homilies are plainly and ſmartly to declare againſt the groſs Acts of Impiety, and to perſwade a true Chriſtian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment in Word and Deed; and her whole Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aims at the Deſign of the Goſpel, to teach Men to live <hi>Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly.</hi> She flatters and lulls no man aſleep in Vice, but tells all ſecure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners plainly, that they do not pray nor receive aright, that they are not abſolv'd, that their perſons are not juſtified, nor can have any true hopes of Heaven, except they purifie themſelves, and be really juſt and good. She neither uſeth nor allows any nice diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in plain Duties, to baffle our Obedience; nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:658"/> ſuffers a cunning head to ſerve the deſigns of a wicked heart, and teach Men learnedly to ſin; but urgeth plain Virtues laid down diſtinctly in Holy Writ, and taught by Natural Reaſon and Conſcience (without calling them mean Duties, or ordinary Morality) to be the great Ornament of our Religion, and the Soul of our Faith. She ſets no abſtruſe and phantaſtick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, nor any Marks, whoſe truth muſt be fetcht in by long deductions and conſequences, for Men to judge by, whether they ſhall be ſav'd or no; but Faith and good Works, which the Philoſopher and meaneſt Chriſtian can eaſily judge of. The civil intereſt of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Edifi'd by ſuch a Church, preſſing the neceſſity of good Works; not onely thereby enforcing Peace and Juſtice, Pity and Tenderneſs, Humility and Kindneſs, one towards another; but ſhe makes Kings ſafer, and Subjects more ſecure, condemning both Tyranny and Diſobedience; Parents more obey'd, and Subjects more lov'd, commanding equally Bowels and Affections, and Duty and Honour; Maſters and Servants, Husbands and Wives, and all Relations, are kept in their juſt Bounds and Priviledges. With other Churches, we make good Works neceſſary to Salvation, but think our ſelves more modeſt and ſecure in taking away Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Merit, and advancing the Grace of Chriſt: With other Men, we cry up Faith, but not an hungry and a ſtarved one, but what is fruitful of good Works; and ſo have all that others contend for, with greater modeſty and ſecurity.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. How fitly this Church is conſtituted to excite true Devotion. When we make our Addreſſes unto God, we ought to have worthy and reverend Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Nature, a true ſenſe and plain knowledge of the Duty, and of the Wants and Neceſſities for which we pray to be ſuppli'd. All which our Church,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:658"/> to help our Devotion, plainly ſets down, deſcribing God by all his Attributes of juſt, wiſe, and laying forth the Vices and Infirmities of Humane Nature, and that none elſe but God can cure our needs. When her Sons are to pray, the matter of her Petitions are not nice and controverted, trivial, or words of a Party; but plain and ſubſtantial, wherein all agree. Her Words in Prayer are neither ruſtick nor gay, the whole Compoſure neither too tedious nor too ſhort; decently order'd to help our Memories and wandring Thoughts. Reſponſals and ſhort Collects in Publick Devotion are ſo far from being her fault, that they are her beauty and prudence. There are few Caſes and Conditions of Humane Life, whether of a Civil or Spiritual Nature, which have not their proper Prayers and particular Petitions for them, at leaſt as is proper for publick Devotions. When we return our Thanks, we have proper Offices to enflame our Paſſions, to quicken our Reſentment, to excite our Love, and to confirm our future Obedience, the beſt inſtance of gratitude. When we Commemorate the Paſſion of Chriſt, we have a Service fit to move our Affections, to aſſiſt our Faith, to enlarge our Charity, to ſhew forth and exhibit Chriſt and all his bloudy Sufferings, every way to qualifie us to diſcharge that great Duty. She hath indeed nothing to kindle an Enthuſiaſtick heat, nor any thing that ſavours of Raptures and Extaſies, which commonly flow from temper or fraud; but that which makes us manly devout, our Judgment ſtill guiding our Affections. When we enter firſt into Religion, and go out of the World, we have two proper Offices, Baptiſm, and Burial, full of Devotion, to attend thoſe purpoſes. So that if any doth not pray, and give thanks, communicate, and live like a Chriſtian, 'tis not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Services to promote theſe are too plain, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:659"/> hungry, beggarly and mean, but their own mind is not fitly qualifi'd before they uſe them: bring but an honeſt mind to theſe parts of Devotion, a true ſenſe of God, ſober and good purpoſes, and affections well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, that which is plain will prove Seraphical, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Judgment, heighten our Paſſions, and make the Church a Quire of Angels. Without which good diſpoſition, our Devotion is but Conſtitution, or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Peeviſhneſs, Sullenneſs, or Devotion to a Party, a Sacrifice that God will not acccept.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Her Order and Diſcipline. Such are the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and Manners of Men, not to be taught onely by naked Vertue, a natural Judgment, or an immediate Teaching of God; but by Miniſtry and Diſcipline, decent Ceremonies and Conſtitutions, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Methods: theſe are the outward Pales and Guards, the Supplies and Helps for the Weakneſs of Humane Nature. Our Church hath fitted and ordered theſe ſo well, as neither to want or to abound; not to make Religion too gay, nor leave her ſlovingly; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rude nor phantaſtick, but is cloth'd in Dreſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a manly Religion; not to pleaſe or gratifie our ſenſes, ſo as to fix there, but to ſerve the reaſon and judgment of our Mind. There are none of our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which good Men, and wiſe Men, have not judged decent, and ſerviceable to the great ends of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and none of them but derive themſelves from a very ancient Family, being us'd in moſt Ages, and moſt of the Churches of God; and have decency, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and uſefulneſs, to plead for them; to help our Memories, to excite our Affections, to render our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices orderly and comely. Were we indeed all Soul, and ſuch Seraphical Saints, and grown Men, as we make our ſelves, we might then plead againſt ſuch external helps; but when we have Natures of weakneſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:659"/> and paſſion, theſe outward helps may be call'd very convenient, if not generally neceſſary: and as our Nature is mixt of Soul and Body, ſo muſt always our Devotion be here; and ſuch God expects, and is pleas'd with. Our Church is neither defective in Power and Diſcipline (had ſhe her juſt dues; and others would do well to joyn with her in her wiſhes, that they might be reſtor'd) which would turn all into Confuſion; nor yet tyrannical, want of Authority breeding as many, if not more Miſeries than Tyranny, or too much Power; both of them ſevere Curſes of a Nation. But her Government, like her Clime, is ſo well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd together, that the Members of this Chriſtian Society may not be diſſolute or rude with her, nor her Rulers inſolent; being conſtituted in the Church with their different Names and Titles, not for luſtre and greatneſs, and Secular purpoſes, but for ſuppreſſion of Vice, the maintaining of Faith, Peace, Order, and all Virtues, the true Edification of Mens Souls. And if thoſe Vices are not reprov'd and chaſtized, which fall under her Cognizance, 'tis not the fault of her Power, but becauſe by other ways ill reſtrain'd; unneceſſary Diviſions from her, hindring her Diſcipline upon Offenders, and ſo they hinder that Edification which thy contend for. This Government is not Modern, Particular, or purely Humane, but Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, Primitive, and Univerſal, to time as well as place: till ſome private Perſons, for Number, Learning, or Piety, not to be equall'd to the good Men of old, who defended it, and obey'd it, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for it, out of ſome miſtakes of Humane frailty and paſſion, or born down with the iniquities of the times, began to change it, and declaim againſt it, though ſo very fit and proper to promote Chriſtianity in the World. This is a general account of that Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:660"/> that is to be had in that Church in which we live; a more particular one would be too long for this Diſcourſe: but thus much muſt be ſaid, that examine all her particular Parts, and Offices, you will find none of them light, or ſuperſtitious, novel, or too nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ill diſpos'd, or uncouth, improper or burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, no juſt cauſe for any to revolt from her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: but conſidering the preſent circumſtances of Chriſtianity, and Men, <hi>the best conſtituted Church in the World. If therefore Edification be going on to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1. 2 Pet. 3. 18. Rom. 15. 2. 1 Cor. 14. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>or growing in Grace; if it is doing good to the Souls of Men; if it be to make plain the great things in Religion to the underſtandings of Men;</hi> or whatever the import of it is, in relation to Faith or Virtue, which is the condition of our Salvation, it is to be found in this Church; whoſe Conſtitution is apt and fit to do all this: And St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſeems to tell us, that true Edification was a ſtranger to thoſe who ſeparated from the common building; but <hi>thoſe who kept to the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>Communion of the</hi> Church, <hi>built up themſelves in their most holy Faith, and pray'd in the Holy Ghost.</hi> And the honeſt Chriſtian, with greater aſſurance, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Grace and Bleſſings of Chriſt, and the Divine Spirit, whoſe Promiſes are made to them, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Communion of the Church, and not to them who divide from the Body, and have greater hopes of Edification from their Teacher, than the Grace of God, from <hi>Apollos,</hi> that waters, than from Chriſt, the chief Husbandman, who gives the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
                        <p>2. This Conſtitution is us'd and manag'd in the beſt way, by the Paſtours of our Church, to Edifie the Souls of Men. This will appear, if we conſider theſe two things:</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:660"/>
                        <p n="1">1. That there are ſtrict Commands under great Penalties laid upon the Paſtours of our Church to do this; who are not left to their own freedom, and private judgment, or the force onely of common Chriſtianity upon them, thus to improve Mens Souls committed to their charge; but have Temporal Mulcts and Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures held over them, to keep them to their Duty. That when they do inform or direct their Flocks about their Belief, they ſhould keep to the Analogy of Faith, or Form of ſound Words. Or when they perſwade to practice, their Rules and Propoſitions muſt be according to Godlineſs. That whenever they Exhort or Rebuke, Preach or Pray; whenever they Direct, or Anſwer the Scruples of Mens Minds, in the whole Exerciſe and Compaſs of their Miniſtry, they are to have an Eye to the Creed; to regard Mercy and Juſtice, the Standard of good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; in ſhort, to preſerve Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with ſubſtantial Devotion; which will to the purpoſe Edifie Mens Souls, and effectually ſave them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That theſe Commands are obey'd by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of our Church, and they do all things in it to Edification. For the truth of this, we appeal to good Men, and wiſe Men, in the Communion of our Church, who have Honeſty and Judgment to confeſs this truth, and with gratitude acknowledge, that the Paſtours of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have led them into the ways of Truth and Righteouſneſs, cured their Ignorance, and reform'd their Lives, and upon good grounds given them an aſſurance of Heaven. To ſay ſuch as theſe are prejudic'd, and want ſincerity and knowledge to paſs a judgment, is onely to prove, what we juſtly ſuſpect, that they want true Edification among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhould be better taught the Doctrine of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:661"/> Charity. Our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Neighbours, impartial Judges, will give their Teſtimony to this Truth, who have own'd and commended the Government of this Church, condemn'd the Separation, magnifi'd the Prudence, Piety, and Works of her Governours and Paſtours, and wiſh'd, that they and their charge were under ſuch a Diſcipline; and tranſlated many of their Pious and Learned Works, to Edifie and Save their People. Our <note place="margin">The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, <hi>p.</hi> 117.</note> diſſenting Brethren themſelves (at leaſt in the good Mood, and out of the heat of Diſpute) give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this, that the Inſtructions and Diſcourſes of our Paſtours from their Pulpits, are Solid, Learned, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, and Pious; and their only Crime was, that ſometimes they were too well ſtudied, and too good. If in the great number of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, ſome few may be lazy, one particular perſon may clothe his Doctrine in too gay a dreſs, another talks Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally above the capacity of his hearers, a third too dully, a fourth too nicely, and opinionatively, and here and there a Paſtour anſwers not the true deſign of Preaching, to inform mens Minds, to guide their Conſciences, and move their Affections; what is this to the general Charge, That no Edification ſo good is to be had, as in the ſeparate Meetings, the pretended Cauſe of their Separation? For 'tis no more a true Cauſe, than want of Accommodation or Room in Churches, for ſome to ſeparate, where good Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Conveniency too may be eaſily had. And ſince they compel our Paſtours to ſpeak well of themſelves, by their detraction and ſpeaking ill of them, they muſt <hi>gladly ſuffer them as fools,</hi> boldly to ſay, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 19.</note> That ſince the Reformation, and many hundred years before, there hath not been a Clergy, ſo Learned and Pious, ſo Prudent and Painful, and every way induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Edifie and ſave the Souls of Men, as now is in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church.</p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:661"/>
                        <p>The Second Argument to confirm the Anſwer, is, That thoſe that uſually make this pretence for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, do commonly miſtake better Edification. We have prov'd already, that good and ſufficient Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to ſave the Souls of Men, is to be had in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church. For if teaching plainly the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, and laying down clearly Rules of Manners, uſing well-compoſed Prayers, and proper Adminiſtration of Sacraments, be not good, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Edification, I know not what Edification means: it may be heating of fancy, ſtirring up of humours, this, or that; and Men may as well define the thing they call Wit, as what Edification means. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deſert the plain and great Duty of our Church-Communion, for diſputable, doubtful, or truly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Edification, is to be guilty of the ſin of Schiſm. In moſt caſes, to judge what is better or beſt, is very hard, and requires a ſincere and conſidering head; and ſo it is in the buſineſs of better Edification, which is ſo eaſily miſtaken, eſpecially by the generality of the People, who are uſually ignorant of ſuch nice things, and prejudic'd by their Parties and Affections, and are <hi>mutable and various, according to their fancies. For better Edification, purer Adminiſtrations and Churches, and things that are more excellent, abſolute Perfection, and a leſs defective Way of Worſhip,</hi> are hard to underſtand, perplex mens minds, and fill them with innumerable doubts and ſcruples, and put them upon refining and purging ſo long, till they weaken and deſtroy the Spirit of Religion.

                           </gap>able advantages; which indeed are only miſtakes, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally are theſe three that follow:</p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:662"/>
                        <p n="1">1. In taking nice and ſpeculative Notions, for great and Edifying Truths. When Doctrines have been rais'd, only to pleaſe the temper of the curious and inquiſitive; yet have made many think, their hearts were warm'd, when their heads and fancies were gratifi'd. And dark and obſcure Diſcourſes about Angels, the ſtate of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Souls, and things of the like nature, have made <note place="margin">Coloſ. 2. 18</note> ſome call the Preacher high and myſterious; while others, teaching the way of Salvation plainly, by Faith and a good Converſation, have been leſſen'd, with the character of dull, honeſt, and moral Men, fit onely for Catechiſts, and Chriſtians of the loweſt Form. Tickle but their imaginations with conjectural Diſcourſes about the Situation of Paradiſe of old, or Hell now, and you are a ſounder Divine, than he, that onely draws wholſom Concluſions from <hi>Adam</hi>'s preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication, to caution you againſt ſin of the like nature, or how to avoid thoſe diſmal flames where ever they are. And others have been ſilly and phantaſtick in admiring thoſe who have pratled about the length of the Sword that guarded Paradiſe, or how the Spirits above paſs Eternity away, and ſcorn'd him, who in plain methods chalkt them out the way that will lead them to Heaven. The ancient <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> becauſe they <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 4.</note> made a mixture of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Fables and Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, of their <hi>Lilith</hi> and <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and fetcht in the Stories of the Gods, out of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Philiſtion,</hi> (two great Divines in the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion) into plain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, thought themſelves the moſt knowing Men, of the Secrets of God and Heaven; and wondred how onely Faith upon Jeſus, and keeping of the Commands, could be knowing of God, or Wiſdom from above. The wranglings of the Schools, with their fine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions and barbarous terms, fitter for Magick than Chriſtianity, by their Diſciples have been priz'd for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:662"/> great and precious Truths. And Enthuſiaſtick Raptures, and ſlights, making once the Brain to ſwim, have ſnatcht the hearers beyond themſelves, and then thought them the Dictates of the Spirit, and the Teachings of God; and the more dark and obſcure the Doctrine hath been, the greater illumination it was eſteem'd, and call'd a noon-day Thought, which was a mid-night Dream. Such things as theſe paſs with too many, for ſaving Truths; a great part of Mankind, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in their Heads, and corrupt in their Practice, eſpous'd to Parties and Intereſts, having Conſtitutions and Paſſions fit for theſe, they readily ſwallow them down. The Apoſtle <hi>confirms the truth of this, telling</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>us, the time will come, when they will not endure ſound Doctrine, but after their own lusts, ſhall they heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching Ears,</hi> caus'd by ſome diſeaſe of Vice within, which is not to be cured by good Phyſick, but onely ſcratch'd and gratifi'd; and if the Food, though wholſom and good, be not to their Palate and Fancy, they complain of hunger and ſtarving. Theſe and many more are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a weak and ſickly nature, craving onely nice and curious things for Spiritual Meat, and kecking at the ſincere Milk of the Word, plain and ſubſtantial Truths, that it may grow thereby. To give therefore a liberty to every Man to run from an eſtabliſhed Church, upon the account of better Edification, which is ſo often and eaſily miſtaken, is to direct Men into temptation and a ſnare, and is dangerous and ſinful; and when once the gap is open, where will, eſpecially the Vulgar, ſtop? May we not add, that this pretence of better Edification is very fit to diſguiſe and colour other Vices? When Controverſies have unhappily riſen, from an unjuſt denial of the Miniſters Rights and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:663"/> Dues, or the accidents of civil converſation, they make the Miniſtry, that was ſpiritual and good before, to be call'd dull and mean, and better muſt be ſought elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; while onely Revenge or Covetouſneſs is at the bottom. Wandring Reports, or their own laviſh Tongue, and cenſorious Temper, have call'd ſome Paſtours, Covetous, or Intemperate, or branded them with other Vices, and then cry out, they cannot Edifie in ſuch a Church; and ſo make one fault help out another, and Defamation muſt excuſe their Schiſm.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In taking the Opinions of Parties for undoubted Truths eſſential to ſalvation. When men have once wedded a Party, and the Opinions peculiar to it, they magnifie and propagate them, grow furious for their defence, and call them the beſt part of Religion: and if theſe be not abetted and cry'd up by the Paſtours of our Church, or they differ from them in explications and diſtinctions of them, the way of ſalvation is not taught, they do not improve their Spiritual condition, and therefore is a juſt cauſe of their Separation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Notion or Explication of Faith, and Spirit, Church, and Grace, Juſtification, Regeneration, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Adoption, and other things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are generally different in our Church from thoſe of the Separation, they therefore cry we deſtroy the ſaving Truths of the Goſpel; and inſtead of being Edifi'd, they find themſelves weakned in their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. Though 'tis plain to all impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that <hi>their ſenſe and interpretation</hi> of them, by natural conſequences leſſen the Grace of the Goſpel, and give ſecurity to lazy Sinners; a ſtrange ſort of Edification! For though our Charity is not ſo narrow, as to think every man a vicious perſon, who is thus miſtaken in his concluſions; yet however, this alters
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:663"/> not the nature of theſe Opinions, and their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; and who knows how far men of ill Principles do improve them? Such is the perverſe and angry temper of many about their own Opinions, no way neceſſary to ſalvation, wherein wiſe men and good men may differ, which are not ſtated by Authority, and may not be determin'd till <hi>Elias</hi> come; yet if theſe be not inſiſted on, and preſs'd with vehemency, the great things of the Goſpel are omitted, and truths are wanting to their perfection. And if once the People are poſſeſs'd with Opinions and Notions, they grow fierce about them, and call them ſalvation-truths, and run head-long into a Sea of diſorder; and tumult, for their defence. The Diſciples of the fifth Monarchy, the Pretenders to the Spirit, the Enemies of Childrens Baptiſm, think themſelves wrong'd, and the Goſpel hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, if caſually they hear you making Interpretations of the Kingdom of Jeſus, the Operations of the Spirit, and that divine Inſtitution, different from their lewd ſenſe. And many Queſtions, when determin'd, after a great deal of labour, and paſſion, and expence of time, may improve our Knowledge, but not Faith and a good Life, the onely Edification. The early and beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thought themſelves mighty Saints, and ſecure of Heaven, if they onely knew <hi>Jeſus and the Reſurrection</hi> in their full extent; and the World being ſuch ill Judges about any other Edification, it would be well if they return'd to this good old way, and reſt ſatisfi'd there, leſt they take the Inventions of Men, Rhetorick or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, ſecular intereſt, or conjectures, for the Pillars of the Temple, to ſupport their Faith; and ſo upon the ſcore of Edification, break the Peace and Unity of the Church, and Obedience to our Governours, the great things of Religion.</p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52190:664"/>
                        <p n="3">3. In taking ſudden heats and warmth for true Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. When melting tones, affectionate expreſſions, ſolemn looks and behaviour, paſſion and vehemency, and other Arts, have play'd upon the fancy, and put their conſtitutions into different motions, ſome have though themſelves ſo ſtrangely Edifi'd, as though it was the impulſe and powerful acting of the Divine Spirit; which many times is no more than a bright or a lowring day can do, acting upon the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and a Doſe of Phyſick will do the ſame. And if they carry the men no further, improve no virtue in them, they are nothing elſe but downright fleſh and blood. And they are hot and cold, high and low, very changeable and uncertain, according as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours flow, and as is the bodily temper of the men. Upon this account ſome are melted into Tears, and others are fired into Rage and Zeal; their Spirits, like Tinder, eaſily catching the flame: and theſe have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the worſt of Men, ſerving onely the Deſigns of Fury and Hypocriſie; and can no more be called Edification, than the Fire from the Altar, that may conſume the Temple, Zeal. Yet ſuch miſtakes as theſe have been too common; Anger and Revenge have been called Zeal for God; Trade and Intereſt have been Baptized Chriſtianity; Fury and Fumes of the Stomach have been thought the Divine Spirit; ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Looks and unmanly Poſtures have been fanci'd true Acts of Devotion; and when they themſelves were pleas'd, and in the good humour, God was reconcil'd; and when they were dull and heavy, the Spirit was withdrawn: and according as theſe heats and bodily paſſions were ſtirr'd, ſo the Miniſtry was Edifying or unprofitable; pale Cheeks and hollow Looks have been <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 16.</note>
                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:664"/> counted ſigns of Grace, and the Diſeaſes of their body paſs'd for the Virtue of their mind. And when a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath been ſo inſinuated, as to hit and favour theſe, they were ſtrangely improv'd, and had obtain'd a good degree in Religion. Many of theſe may be beginnings, or occaſions, leading unto Religion, and may ſerve ſome good purpoſes in men that can manage them well; but to cry up theſe for Edification, and going on unto perfection, is to betray their People into the power of every Cheat and Impoſtor, who hath the knack to raiſe theſe heats, which paſs for reaſon and conviction of mind; and moſt commonly are great hindrances to ſolid and ſound reaſoning, plain diſcourſes, the true way to Edification, to make firm and laſting impreſſions upon the mind; while the ſilly and the weak, who are moſt ſubject to theſe heats and colds, the uncertain motions of their Spirits, are fickle and inconſtant, turning round in all Religions; ſuch men being all Sail, are more eaſily toſt about with every wind of Doctrine.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Argument to confirm the Anſwer, is; That pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of better Edification will cauſe endleſs Diviſions in the Church. This Queſtion doth ſuppoſe, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt judge; and ſo great a part of the World being ignorant and vicious, partial and prejudic'd, falſe and inſincere to themſelves and others, they may run from Teacher to Teacher, from <hi>Presbyterian</hi> to <hi>Independent,</hi> from <hi>Independent</hi> to <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> or <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and never ſtop till they come at their Grave, to find out better Edification; <hi>ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> ever ſeeking, and <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 7.</note> never ſatisfi'd, till they find the Pattern upon the Mount, or the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be come down from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:665"/> above; till they meet with ſuch a perfect Church, as perhaps will never be here upon earth, till her great Maſter comes. The ignorant will eaſily miſtake, and who can know the heart and intention of the falſe and the Hypocrite? And the Governour hath nothing to do here to retrench this liberty, which, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is either born with them, or given them by God. At this rate, may not every ſingle perſon be a Church, leaving all other Chriſtian Societies, fancying that he can better Edifie at home with the workings of his own mind, and ſome pretended infuſions of the Spirit, that he ſhall better meet with in his privacies and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than in an external and carnal Miniſtry and Crowd? When once they have torn the Unity of the Church in pieces, and ſet up their more Edifying Meetings, in comes whole ſhoals of Vices; Envy and Detraction, Strife and Emulation, Murmurings and Complainings, Fierceneſs and Wrath, and a great number of things more, prejudicial to the State of the Kingdom, the intereſt of Families, the good of Friendſhip and all civil Converſation; a wonderful Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, deſtroying the very Soul of Chriſtianity! The ſame Principles that divide them from this Church, will crumble them into endleſs Parties; and every little Chip may call it ſelf a Building, and ſo deſtroy all good Government and Diſcipline, ſo neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and preſerve Chriſtianity in the World. And ſhould I live to ſee that fatal day, when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our Church ſhould be diſſolv'd, and liberty given to every man, upon pretence of better Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to chuſe his Paſtour and his Church; ſo many Miſchiefs and Confuſions would follow from it, that if there was any regard to common Chriſtianity, or ſenſe of temporal happineſs left within their Breaſt,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:665"/> they would too late repent their Schiſm, (as once in a great degree many of them did) and beg upon their Knees, that the Pale of this Government in Church might be ſet up again, and they would receive it with all its pretended load of Impoſitions. This will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow from dividing from the Church; to the laughter of <hi>Rome,</hi> and joy of all the Enemies of our Chriſtian Religion. All this would be avoided, if men were ſenſible of the hainous nature of Schiſm, which the Apoſtles and all the ancient Chriſtians have painted forth in ſuch black colours, though others think our Diviſions in the Church are no more, than variety of Companies and Liveries in a City.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. What great diſcouragement this is to an honeſt and truly Chriſtian Miniſtry. When a Paſtour of our Church ſhall diligently and faithfully, plainly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly unfold the Articles of Faith, and lay down Rules for Practice, which will certainly bring him to Heaven; yet his Flock or Charge, one after another, upon pretence of greener Paſtures, greater Knowledge, better Elocution, Delivery, Tone, or the like, to be had elſewhere, ſhall run from him; will it not cool his Zeal, check his Labours, and affront his Perſon and Office? This may be done to the painful, as well as idle; to the judicious and learned, as well as impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Ignorant Paſtour, where the People ſhall have liberty of Separation for the ſake of Edification. The ill effects of this, have turn'd upon their own Miniſters, and new Government; and the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious among them have ſadly complain'd of it. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they Petition'd, for a painful and preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, but this pretence of better Edification gives denial to their own requeſt; ſuch Diſcouragements as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:666"/> theſe happening ſeverely ſometimes to the beſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, as well as the worſt. And they have no cure for this, having put a power into the Peoples hands which they cannot recal; for neither King, Parliament, Biſhop, or Paſtour, can tell them what is Edification ſo well as themſelves. And are the Paſtours of the Church to be ſo treated and trifled with, who derive their Offices and Authority from God to Command and Perſwade, to Rebuke and Exhort, and have the Charge of Souls committed to them, for fancies, peeviſhneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to be ſcorn'd and diſcountenanc'd, and have their Miniſtry rendred uſeleſs, and the Sheep to govern the Shepherd? But what if our Paſtour be idle or remiſs in his Duty, or corrupt in his Faith, and teacheth Errour inſtead of ſound Doctrine, and we have no means of Edification? what muſt we do? muſt we take in Poyſon for Food? or not be fed at all? To be ſure, you muſt not run into Schiſmatical Separation; 'tis more tolerable to go to other Congregations of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; that may be irregular, but 'tis not Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: but thanks be to God, we have a Government, which upon a juſt and modeſt Complaint, will quicken the lazy and negligent, correct the Heretical Paſtour, and reſtore to you true Edification.</p>
                        <p>That this Diſcourſe may prevail upon ſuch who make this Queſtion, I deſire to recommend theſe two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, which are very reaſonable, to their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That if they fancy any Defects in our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould not hence conclude, that they have not ſufficient Edification in the Church to ſave their Souls. If upon a nice ſearch and critical enquiry, they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:666"/> think they have found ſome little Flaws and Defects, improper Phraſes, doubtful Senſes, and ſome ſmall Omiſſions in the matter of our Prayers and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, yet let them not conclude, that theſe can weigh in the ballance againſt the black ſin of Schiſm and Separation, and all its ſad Conſequences, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd by nothing elſe but terms of Communion plainly ſinful. Have not Divine Services been accepted, which were leſs perfect, and came not up to their rule? as is plain in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Paſſover, which was not to the <hi>Purification of the Sanctuary,</hi> yet the good King's <note place="margin">2 Chron. 30. 18, 19, 20.</note> Prayer, and <hi>the neceſſity</hi> of the time, prevail'd with God <hi>to heal the People,</hi> that is, to repute them clean and well prepar'd, and their Sacrifice and Devotion good. Is there no Reverence to be paid to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Authors of our Service and Reformation, but to tell them, they muſt divide from them, were they now living? for they cannot Edifie under that Religion and Government for which they dy'd. Is there, or will there ever be any Government in the Church, ſo well fram'd and built, but ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Surveyor can ſpy out ſome diſproportion or ill ſhape, eſpecially if aſſiſted by ill Nature, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Spirit of Pride and Contention, which is ever quick-ſighted abroad, and blind at home? the difficulty of knowing what is utmoſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and abſolute purity of Adminiſtrations, (which, till attain'd, theſe Men think they are not to reſt in any Church) ſhould make them judge candidly, interpret fairly, and comply with every thing, that is not ſinful, to preſerve Peace and Love. When Men in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught to believe well, to live well, and to dye well, and have good and proper Offices to ſerve
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:667"/> theſe great purpoſes, in order to their Salvation, what can they deſire more? To be better, or more ſav'd, we know not what it means. To leave ſuch a Communion, upon ſuch an account, proceeds from peeviſhneſs, uncharitableneſs, or ſome ill Principle; and is downright Schiſm, if ever there was Schiſm in the World. Bring but an honeſt, ſincere and teachable mind, and it will find improvement and advantage in Offices and Adminiſtrations fuller of ſpots and blemiſhes far than they can pretend to find in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; but if the mind be byaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Party, or corrupted by Deſigns, if its Palate be vitiated, the beſt Food is coarſe and inſipid to it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let Edification be plac'd in the ſubſtantial things of Religion. Some revolt from our Church for things wherein the Paſtour is ſolely concern'd, and others for things of decency, and indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but theſe things do not concern the Caſe of Edification. That a right Faith, and an honeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, are not taught in our Church, is onely a ſcandal caſt upon her, to plead for their unjuſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. For after ſhe hath plainly and diſtinctly taught the Articles of Faith, (as was prov'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) with the ſame Spirit and Zeal ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and preſſes Juſtice, Humility, Mercy, and every Virtue that is neceſſary to a true Chriſtian Life, and both under the Penalty of Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: theſe, and theſe alone, do truly Edifie the Souls of Men; as is plain, if we conſider, that our Prayers and Sacraments, our Churches Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Diſcipline, and all other parts in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are in order to, and miniſter unto Faith their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:667"/> head, that works by love: and the nearer theſe approach unto, and the greater ſervice they do to this deſign, the greater degree they have in Religion, and more value is ſet upon them. This is that Religion which our firſt Parent was of in his Paradiſe and innocency; <hi>Noah</hi> and his Poſterity in their Precepts; and Pious Men in different Countries before the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> thus ſerv'd God. And the ſcope and aim of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, with its Temple and Utenſils, its Figures and Ceremonies, was to diſcipline and teach Men thus to be good, with allowance to the Nature of that People, and the Times they liv'd in. And the beſt and moſt knowing <hi>Pagans</hi> thought ſuch a Religion as this would moſt pleaſe God; who therefore in ſome meaſure did accept it, and reward it with greater Diſcoveries, as is plain <note place="margin">Acts 8. 27. Acts 10. 4.</note> in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Candaces</hi> Treaſurer, and others, who having not the Law, were a Law unto themſelves. In ſuch things as theſe, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Meſſias was to conſiſt; not in Meat <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> and Drink, but Righteouſneſs and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Such a Religion as this, Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in ſo great a degree, that 'tis the onely Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Qualification for the upper World; where (though other great Parts of Religion ſhall dye with us) Righteouſneſs, Gratitude, Love of God, and glorifi'd Beings, and ſuch like Virtues, are of an Eternal Nature, ſhall be Ingredients of our Happineſs, and ſhall live with us for ever. What can be juſtly requir'd in Religion, to improve Mens Souls, that is not found in this? Is it to recover the Nature of Man now defac'd? Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:668"/> and Goodneſs, proceeding from Faith, their root, will make us truly good. Is it to give us a clearer Knowledge and worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of God? ſuch a practical Religion as this, beſt prepares for greater knowledge, and in Scripture-ſence is knowing of him. Is it Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 4.</note> to love God? the love of God conſiſts in obedience to his Precepts, ſubmiſſion to his Will, and reſignation to his Providence; otherwiſe 'tis flattery and fondneſs. Is it the deſign of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to bleſs Mankind here, and edifie them in their different relations? ſuch a Religion as this in our Church will do all that, and make the World a Paradiſe once more. This will give us the beſt character to judge by, whether we ſhall be ſav'd or no, being the perfection of all other marks and ſigns of our aſſurance of Life and Glory. When we are ſo Edifi'd and Religious, we are certain, that we are juſtifi'd and adopted, accepted and treated like the Sons of God; that we are in Chriſt, and have our wedding-Garments on, our proper qualifications for the ſtate of Heaven. Such an honeſt Principle as this, makes our Prayers to be heard, our Devotions to be regarded, our Hopes to be ſtrengthened. This is the great intention of Chriſtianity, the Holy of Holys of our Temple, and all Religion. Such a Religion as this being ſo ſtrongly enjoyn'd and zealouſly taught in our Church, no ways diſguis'd by a dreſs of Phraſes, or corrupted into ſoft and luſhious ſences, we need not complain for want of the means of Grace and Edification; we need not croſs the Seas, or run into private corners for it; 'tis nigh us,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:668"/> even at our Doors, in the eſtabliſh'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Some uſe to ſay, that brown Bread and the Goſpel was very good Fare; but now they are grown as nice and delicate about Religion and Edification, as about Sawces and Dreſſes. Thanks be to God, 'tis a knowing Age, I wiſh it was as good. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it doth not ariſe for want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Information; if it doth, the Cure is near, let them value that Church and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hath all things in it ſufficient to Mens Salvation. Let them not think ſo light of Schiſm, and ſpeaking evil of the Rule and Diſcipline in our Church, ſo fit and neceſſary to the preſervation of Chriſtianity; let them not cry up other <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi>'s; any other Teachers making Diviſions among us, than this Church hath allowed for their Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; which is ſo far from Spiritual Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it calls ſuch Men <hi>Carnal.</hi> For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 4.</note> of any other Nouriſhment, <hi>beſide ſuch</hi> plain Food, is Spiritual <hi>Pride and Wantonneſs;</hi> and they pamper their Fancies, while they ſtarve their Judgments. Let us therefore ſtick to ſuch a manly Religion, one great part of which is, to preſerve Obedience, Peace, and Order; and ſay of our Church, that teacheth it, as the Diſciples of its Author; <hi>Thou art he, and we ſeek for no other: whither ſhall we go? thou hast the Words of Eternal Life.</hi> She hath all things in her that are neceſſary <hi>for the perfecting of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12, 13.</note> 
                           <hi>the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body; till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the</hi>

                           <hi>A Diſcourſe</hi> Of PROFITING by SERMONS.</head>
                        <p>AS there is nothing that all good Men more deſire, nothing that they more heartily ſeek and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than a Happy re-union of all thoſe with us, who have Rent themſelves from us (which we ſhould reckon to be one of the higheſt bleſſings that God can now beſtow upon us) ſo there is little hope of ſeeing thoſe deſires and endeavours ſatisfied, while the ſmalleſt Scruples ſeem a ſufficient cauſe to hinder many People from joyning with us.</p>
                        <p>But among all the Reaſons that I have heard alledged for leaving our Churches, this ſeems to me to be the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ungrounded, That our Miniſters are unedify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preachers; for they cannot profit by their Sermons. Which, I am informed, is ſo commonly objected, and ſome lay ſuch weight upon it, and it carries with it ſuch a ſhew of Piety (it being a very commendable thing to deſire to be the better for every Sermon one hears) that it is thought to be worth ſome body's pains, to try to remove this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Prejudice which too many have entertained againſt the moſt inſtructive and uſeful Sermons, that, perhaps, are preached any where in the Chriſtian World,</p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:673"/>
                        <p>This may ſeem too high a commendation; but it is the Judgment of more indifferent perſons then we are, on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; of ſtrangers I mean, who have ſeen the World; and having learnt our language and heard and read the Sermons that are commonly preached and printed in this great City, affirm there are not the like to be found in any Church whatſoever. God grant we be not deprived of ſuch ſingular helps by our contempt of them; and that our Candleſtick be not removed out of its place, becauſe we withdraw our ſelves from the light which it holds forth to us.</p>
                        <p>Of which we are in very great danger, if not knowing what it is truly to profit by Sermons, we make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at all in the ſtate of Chriſtianity: but deceive our own Souls in a vain opinion of our acquaintance with God, and our bleſſed Saviour, and the Myſteries of the Goſpel, which have little or no effect upon our hearts and lives.</p>
                        <p>I do not pronounce this to be the caſe of thoſe who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to us, that we have an unprofitable Miniſtry: but I doubt not to demonſtrate, that the Sermons which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally preached by the Miniſtry in this City (to whoſe Inhabitants I principally write) are ſuch that they may profit by them, if it be not their own fault: and then leave them to Judg of themſelves as they ſee cauſe.</p>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe we are all agreed, or may eaſily agree, what it is to profit by Sermons: for we agree that the Holy Scriptures contain all things neceſſary to our Salvation; and therefore when they are rightly opened, and duly applied in a Sermon, ſo that the Hearers improve either in Chriſtian <hi>knowledg,</hi> or in <hi>Faith,</hi> or in <hi>well-doing,</hi> then they profit by that Sermon. Now if any Man do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in theſe, by the help of the Sermons, which he may hear in our Churches, and the Fault lye in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:673"/> it muſt be either in the <hi>matter</hi> of it, or in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> for none, I preſume, will be ſo bold as to affirm, that Gods Spirit doth not accompany a Sermon, which wants nothing belonging to either of theſe, the Preacher alſo being duely qualified. And, thanks be to God, there are none that dare now complain of an <hi>Idle, Scandalous, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient</hi> Miniſtry about this City: but inſtead of that, they, that were wont to have thoſe words in their mouths, have taken up the complaint of an <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nedifying.</hi> Whereby we have gained this great Point, That they have no colour to pretend the Perſon who preaches is unſanctified, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth not bleſs his Miniſtry: but the fault muſt lye (if there be any) in the Sermon it ſelf; and that in the <hi>matter</hi> of which it conſiſts, or in the <hi>manner</hi> of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
                        <div n="1" type="part">
                           <head>I.</head>
                           <p>And as for the former of theſe, I can ſcarce think that any Diſſenter, when he ſeriouſly conſiders, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt our Sermons upon that account; they being taken out of the Holy Scriptures (which are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Religion) and with ſuch care to find out their true ſenſe and proper meaning, that perhaps they were never more clearly opened, and rightly applied, then they are now adays in our Churches. I am ſure, All that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Truth which was delivered to our firſt Parents, when they were about to be expelled out of Paradiſe; which God repeated in his Promiſes to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> which he ſhadowed and confirmed in the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> illuſtrated by the Oracles of the Prophets; and finally fulfilled in the Incarnation, Birth, Life, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcenſion of the Son of God; and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Preaching of the Apoſtles and the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, all over the World; is there ſo fully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly taught, that we may ſafely ſay, the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:674"/> of Gods Will is at one time or other faithfully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among us.</p>
                           <p>And as that is declared compleatly, ſo little elſe is medled withal: matters of controverſie being as rarely handled in our Pulpits, I believe, as in any place of the World: unleſs it be thoſe which the preſent State of things, ſometimes makes abſolutely Neceſſary, to fortifie the People againſt Popery, and againſt Separation: yet even theſe are not ſo often treated of, as matters of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concernment to all Parties of Chriſtians whatſoever. For the great drift of our Preachers ſeems to be, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the People in the Truth, and to make them good (particularly to give them right notions of God, which are the very bottom of all Religion) knowing that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Superſtitions will fall of themſelves, without a particular confutation. For they are ſupported by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ignorance and naughty affections; which will uphold them againſt all the Arguments whereby they can be aſſaulted, unleſs mens minds be informed and poſſeſſed with ſuch a right ſenſe of things, as alters their Wills and Affections, and turns them to an unfeigned love of God and Goodneſs.</p>
                           <p>Which ſeems to me to be the aim and ſcope of the Sermons which are generally preached by our Miniſters: and which is ſo well performed, that we need not fear to affirm, there is nothing neceſſary either to make men truly knowing in the things of God; or to work belief in them; or to confirm them in the Faith; or to direct them in their practice of what they know and believe; or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to follow thoſe directions, and to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of the Goſpel; or to ſatisfie material Scruples; to reſolve doubts and caſes of Conſcience; to comfort diſconſolate penitents, and awaken drowſie ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or any thing of like Nature: but may be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:674"/> in our Churches, ſo fully, ſolidly, and judiciouſly handled, that men need go no whither elſe for Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if that be the thing they truly deſire, and ſincerely ſeek and indeavour.</p>
                           <p>For what truth can they learn any where elſe, which is not to be learnt, if they will attend upon Gods ſervice there, in our Churches? what Motives to believe, or what Arguments to convince men of their Duty, which are not there repreſented, and preſſed? What Vice is there, which doth not there receive juſt Correction? What Virtue that is not there moſt ſtrongly recommended? which of the promiſes are not there applied to the Hearts of the faithful? and where can men have better means of knowing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Lord, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, againſt all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and diſobedient? And if men cannot profit where ſuch things as theſe are conſtantly managed, to as much advantage, as the skill of the Preacher will inable him, I am ſure the fault muſt lie ſomewhere elſe, than in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sermons.</p>

                           <p>Yes, will ſome ſay, we allow the <hi>matter</hi> of them to be good enough: but the <hi>manner</hi> of them is ſuch, that we cannot reap the like benefit by them, that we do by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens preaching, who cannot conform to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Which if it be a juſt Exception, the fault muſt lie either in the <hi>Compoſition</hi> of them; or in their <hi>delivery</hi> after they are compoſed.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Now if the <hi>compoſition</hi> of them be faulty, it is becauſe their <hi>Method</hi> is not clear and perſpicuous; or the <hi>Language</hi> not plain enough to convey the Senſe of them to the mind of the Hearers. Neither of which, I am confident can be truly charged upon them. For never did men more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour orderly diſcourſe, and aim at plain, unaffected
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:675"/> Speech, than they do now in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> where good Senſe, in the moſt eaſie and familiar Words, is now lookt upon as the principal Commendation of Sermons.</p>
                           <p>Some indeed, I have heard, find fault with our Sermons for not keeping the old method (as they call it) of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe:</hi> which is altogether unjuſt as well as frivolous. For there is no man that baulks that Method when it is natural; but rather chuſes it, becauſe it hath been common, and is eaſie and uſeful. As for example, if any man among us, were to preach upon this text, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> XIII. 13. <hi>And now abideth Faith, Hope and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; theſe three; but the greateſt of theſe is Charity;</hi> He would, without doubt, not only obſerve among other <hi>Doctrines, the preheminence of Charity:</hi> but alſo give the beſt Reaſons, he could think of, why it ought to be higheſt in our Eſteem, and our Affections too; becauſe it is the very end of Faith and Hope; and becauſe it makes us like unto God, which Faith and Hope do not. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch like things, he would likewiſe make that Uſe of this Doctrine, which the Apoſtle himſelf doth Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the very next words (Verſe 1. Chapter XIV.) preſſing every one to <hi>follow after</hi> the Love of God, and of their Neighbour: to follow it earneſtly and vigorouſly, and never ceaſe their purſuit till they feel their Hearts poſſeſſed with it: not contenting themſelves meerly with believing, but being ſo affected with it, that they attain the end of their Faith, which ought to <hi>work by Love.</hi> Nay, he would wiſh them to examine and prove their Faith by this, whether it be likely to ſave them or no. For if it leave them ſhort of this Charity, it will leave them ſhort of Heaven: for it is Charity alone that hath any place there. And who would forbear moſt pathetical intreaties here, to be very ſerious in this ſearch: there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:675"/> being ſo much Pretence to <hi>Faith</hi> in the World, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Charity</hi> to be found there. To one ſort of Faith eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, which is the apprehenſion of Chriſts Merits, and application of them to themſelves, which every Body makes bold withal, whilſt very few have any thing of that Charity which St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes in the Chapter before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, of <hi>that long ſuffering and kind Charity; which envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, which vaunteth not it ſelf,</hi> (or is not raſh) <hi>is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no Evil;</hi> (but takes things in the beſt Senſe, and puts the faireſt Conſtruction upon them;) in one Word, makes a Man inoffenſive not only towards God but towards Men of all ſorts, high and low, rich and poor; that is, to the whole Church of God.</p>
                           <p>The like I might ſay of all other Subjects of the ſame nature, which lead him that handles them into this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. But ſometime the matter to be treated of is ſuch, that there is no other Reaſon to be given of it but only the divine Revelation, upon whoſe Teſtimony we receive it; as we do, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Eternal Son of God, begotten of his Father before all Worlds.</hi> The <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of which I never heard any Preacher amougſt us fail to make, both for the begetting Reverence towards him, Faith in him, and Obedience unto him.</p>
                           <p>But what need is there of ſo many Words about this method of Sermons, when the ancient Doctors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is manifeſt, did not mind it, nor any other? But ſpake to the Buſineſs before them, without obſerving any conſtant Rule at all in their Diſcourſes: and then it is apparent People profited by Sermons much more than they do now, when they are moſt artificially contrived. And it would be an inexcuſable Sin in thoſe that ſhould leave our Church, did the Miniſters of it only open the Senſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:676"/> of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> or the <hi>Goſpel</hi> for the day (or any other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Holy Scripture, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was wont to do) without making particular Obſervations, or concluding all with diſtinct Uſes (as the manner now is) but only with a general Application, preſſing what they thought moſt material, or what the neceſſities of their People moſt required.</p>
                           <p>By which way of preaching if Men can receive no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, they muſt lay the Blame ſomewhere elſe than upon the <hi>Compoſition</hi> of the Sermon, or the <hi>manner of its Delivery</hi> either, which is the next thing to be conſidered.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now here two things are found fault withal: <hi>firſt,</hi> That our Preachers are not <hi>vehement</hi> enough in the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Sermons; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That they <hi>read</hi> them.</p>
                           <p>For the former of theſe, it is not true: where the matter in hand is of great concernment, and requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>res more than ordinary earneſtneſs. Which ought in reaſon, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for ſome certain Occaſions, and not be ſpent upon all things alike: for then it loſes its effect at that time, when it would be moſt ſeaſonably and uſefully employed.</p>
                           <p>But there is a great miſtake in that which men call <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence:</hi> which oft-times conſiſts only in the ſtrength of the voice: which neither all your Preachers, nor all ours are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed withal. And if they were, would be but noiſe; without good Senſe, which will move attentive minds as much as a loud ſound affects Mens Ears.</p>
                           <p>Add to this, that there is a natural heat alſo in ſome Mens tempers, which makes them ſpeak vehemently; with ſuch a warmth as hath the appearance of much Zeal: when they are nothing near ſo deeply affected with what they ſay, as ſome Men of more ſedate and cool tempers are, whoſe Judgment operates more ſtrongly than their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And theſe Men ſurely may be very ſerviceable for Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the Mind; with ſuch force of Argument as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52190:676"/> will certainly move the affections vehemently by the help of ſerious Conſideration: without which if any affections be raiſed, they are little worth; and will not laſt, but vaniſh as ſoon as that blaſt is over which ſtirred them up.</p>
                           <p>And this difference of temper is obſervable in your Men, as well as in ours: and therefore this can be no hindrance to Edification among us, no more than among you.</p>
                           <p>As for <hi>reading of Sermons,</hi> it is not univerſally uſed: but there are thoſe among us whom God hath bleſſed with ſuch ſtrength of Memory or readineſs of Conception that they need not the help of any Notes at all in the Pulpit. And others do not tye themſelves to them, ſo as never to look off the Book; but only aſſiſt their Memory by them ſometimes. Whereby the Auditory is aſſured that they hear nothing but what hath been beforehand conſidered and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted: and the Preacher himſelf alſo is ſecured that he ſhall not forget any thing of Moment which he hath prepared; &amp; that no Expreſſion ſlip from him on a ſudden which may prove indecent or imprudent. As for thoſe whoſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Memory, or their great Modeſty and Fear of being out (as we ſpeak) compells them to keep their Eye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon their Notes; as they and others have the forenamed advantages by it, ſo no Man can be in the leaſt prejudiced by it, who will but turn his Eyes another way and not look upon the Preacher. Then the Sermon will ſound as well as if it were all pronounced without Book: or if this make it unprofitable, by the ſame reaſon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures become unprofitable, when they are read out of the Bible; and they alſo muſt be got without Book, to make them edifying. Nay, this exception will lye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo againſt ſome of your own Preachers of great note, who read every word. I am ſure they did ſo heretofore, and this was then thought no hindrance to your profiting by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52190:677"/> them: or if it were, you heard them when you could not profit by them, ſo as you could by thoſe that did not read. And ſo you may do now by our Preachers of this kind, nay ſo you ought to do: when you have nothing to ſay againſt them, but what they are equally chargeable withal whom you highly commend.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div n="3" type="part">
                           <head>III.</head>
                           <p>But after all, I have ſome reaſon to fear that when men complain they cannot profit by our Sermons, they mean nothing by profiting, but that their affections are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the hearing of them, ſo as they are by the Sermons of Nonconformiſts. Unto which I have many things to ſay if this Paper would contain them: but it will be ſufficient to touch only upon theſe three.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That Men have ſeveral Talents, both among you and among us: which are all very profitable. Some for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Judgment; others for moving the Affections; and others (which is moſt deſirable) for both: you are not able to ſay that all yours move you ſo as ſome do: and yet you make ſuch account of all, that it hath ever been lookt upon as a very diſorderly thing among your ſelves (and worſe than that I ſhall prove by and by) for People to run from their own Miniſter to hear ſome other (though of the ſame way) meerly to have the affections more moved. Becauſe,</p>
                           <p n="2">2. This alone is ſo far from profiting by Sermons, that it is very great unprofitableneſs, to be moved by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and do nothing thereupon, but only commend it. That is, to be tickled and pleaſed a while, but not altered nor changed a whit: or to be warmed perhaps a little for the preſent, and then left as cold as a ſtone, without any ſpiritual life, or indeavour to be the better.</p>
                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:677"/>
                           <p n="3">3. But the great thing of all is this, that affections rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meerly by the earneſtneſs of the Preacher, at preſent in the hearing of a Sermon (and it is well if the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſome People ſpeak of, be not Motions which they feel meerly from the tone of the voice, as from a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king phraſe, a ſimilitude or ſome ſuch trifle) are nothing comparable to thoſe, which we raiſe by Gods bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own ſerious conſideration, when we reflect upon what we have heard, which ſort of moſt excellent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Sermons that are preached in our Churches, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to produce, if you pleaſe but to attend to the matter of them and preſs them upon your Hearts: Nay, your Judgments being well informed, it would not be hard for you (if you would but take a little pains with your ſelves) to excite ſuch affections unto that which you know to be your Duty as would abide and remain; when the others that were excited in the hearing of a Sermon, are gone, and quite vaniſhed, and can never be recalled, but by your own ſerious Meditation upon thoſe Divine Truths, which entred into your Mind, and would have touched, nay peirced your Hearts, if you would have brought them thither, and held them cloſe to your Conſciences.</p>
                           <p>Which ought to be every Chriſtians care more than I doubt it is, in order to their profiting by Sermons; and that they <hi>may not be barren and unfruitful in the Knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </div>

                           <p>And now it is time for all thoſe who are concerned in what hath been ſaid, to apply it to the preſent caſe, and going down into themſelves to enquire where the fault muſt neceſſarily lye, if the Sermons preached by our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have proved unprofitable to them; which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52190:678"/> that they who object this againſt coming to Church, have come heretofore, at leaſt to the Sermon; but went away, and came no more, becauſe they reaped no benefit thereby. Elſe, how can they pretend that our Sermons are unprofitable if they never heard them? Now I have demonſtrated, that the blame cannot be juſtly caſt upon the Sermons, which in themſelves are every way fitted to do Men good: and therefore we muſt ſeek for the cauſe of this Unprofitableneſs ſome where elſe; and where are we ſo likely to find it as in thoſe that heard the Sermons? Whom I beſeech, in the fear of God, by whoſe Word we muſt one day be all judged, to conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves impartially, and to ask their Conſciences ſuch <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi> as theſe.</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Had you not ſome Prejudice in your Mind againſt the Perſon of the Miniſter whom you came to hear, either upon the ſcore of his Conformity, or of his ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, or ſome other account? If you had, and carried it along with you, there is great Reaſon to think this made his Pains unprofitable to you; becauſe you could not hear him with that indifference which you would have heared another man withal. But looking upon him perhaps as a <hi>Time-ſerver,</hi> (as the Language of ſome hath been) a <hi>Formaliſt,</hi> or one who you preſumed before-hand had little or nothing of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in him, you minded not ſo much what was ſaid, as who ſaid it; and diſliked thoſe things which out of another Mouth you would have accepted. For if ſuch Prejudices as theſe be not laid aſide, they bar the Heart ſo ſtrongly againſt the moſt excellent Inſtructions, that though an Angel from Heaven ſhould deliver to us the moſt Important Truths, yet, we taking him for a Miniſter of <hi>Satan,</hi> it would ſtop our Ears againſt him, and make his Meſſage ineffectual.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Or might not this be rhe reaſon of your reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52190:678"/> no benefit, that you came to Church but once or twice, and concluded too haſtily there was no Good to be got there; being willing alſo perhaps, to have this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for abſenting your ſelf wholly from it: whereas if you had conſtantly attended our Miniſtry, you might have found your ſelves ſo much improved thereby, as never to have thought of leaving the Church upon this account, that you could not profit in it. Make a Tryal now (for it is not too late, I hope, if you can ſhake off all Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) and for ſome time continue diligent Auditors of the Miniſter of your Pariſh; and that which at firſt may ſeem to you dull, or hard, or obſcure, will, after you are uſed to it, be clear, eaſie, and awakning: when you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, that is, with his Method, his Stile, his way of Reaſoning and Diſcourſe, (as well as accuſtomed to his Voice) which you cannot be in an inſtant, or at the firſt hearing. For the Scriptures themſelves are obſcure and difficult, to the beſt of us, in abundance of places, till by Converſation with them, we grow acquainted with their Phraſe, manner of Speaking, Arguing and Connexion. And if God's Word had been generally uſed, as ſome among us have treated his Miniſters (rejecting them, I mean, becauſe they did not preſently apprehend them) it had been thrown out of all mens hands long ago as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable piece.</p>
                           <p>3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> I deſire ſuch further, to examine ſeriouſly and recollect themſelves, Whether the thing that made them firſt forſake our Miniſtry, as unprofitable, was not, That when they came to Church the Preacher hapned to treat on ſome Subject croſs to their Opinion? Which haſty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (who conſider not what different Apprehenſions men may have in many matters, and yet agree well enough to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) cannot brook; but preſently fling away from thoſe that contradict them, as if they contradicted God himſelf.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:679"/> Whereas, if they would have had Patience, they might have profited even by ſuch Diſcourſes; either by being convinced of their Error, or more confirmed in that which they took for truth; being able to anſwer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought againſt it.</p>
                           <p>4. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But (that which is worſe than this) the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was perhaps upon ſome diſtaſtful Subject when you chanced to go to Church, and hapned to treat of ſuch matters as you love not to hear of, though more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it may be, than many others, for this very Reaſon, that becauſe of their Ungratefulneſs they are ſeldom han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled. Will you not be angry nor lay aſide this Paper and read no further, if I give an Inſtance or two? Which I mentioned for no other Reaſon, but becauſe I know ſome have taken offence (as they call it at ſuch Doctrines, and ought, if it be poſſible, to be better taught. Was he not preaching, I mean, about <hi>Schiſm,</hi> or <hi>Diſobedience to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours?</hi> It is certain there are ſuch Sins, which are very heinous and dangerous every way; and therefore, no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, can, with a good Conſcience, balk the treating of them ſome time or other. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he that treated of them when you was at Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Duties of <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and of <hi>Obedience</hi> further than you deſire, might not you, for all that, have profited ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much by what was ſaid upon thoſe Subjects?</p>
                           <p>I beleive ſober Men among you have heard ſome of your own Miniſters ſpeak harder Words of Conformity and Conformiſts than you would have had them, and yet you did not for that Reaſon leave them, but ſtill fancied you could profit by them; even by what they ſaid on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Conformity. And therefore you would do well to ſearch and try what account you can give of taking ſuch diſtaſte at the eſtabliſhed Miniſtry, as to forſake it upon their preſſing ſome things, which are moſt certainly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:679"/> Chriſtian Duties, with greater ſtrictneſs than agreed with your preſent Inclinations.</p>
                           <p>And I the rather beſeech you to conſider ſuch things as theſe; becauſe it is a common thing to hear Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of your way to complain of their <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitableneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ordinances,</hi> of the <hi>Deadneſs of their Heart in Duty,</hi> and their <hi>Barrenneſs under the moſt powerful means of Grace:</hi> which ariſes perhaps in thoſe minds that are well inclined merely from a natural Dullneſs or Indiſpoſition, which makes them unable to attend, or to remember, and keep in mind, as they deſire, what they have heard; and therefore moral Indiſpoſitions (ſuch as Prejudice, Paſſion, Diſaffection to the way of Worſhip, or to any Chriſtian Doctrine) will much more make men unapt to receive any Impreſſions from what is ſaid to them; though in it ſelf never ſo good, and fitted powerfully to affect the Heart, were it but entertained with an honeſt Mind.</p>
                           <p>So that if you complain of Deadneſs and Unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under the Miniſtry of our Church, it is no more than a great many of you do of the like Barrenneſs under your own; but proceeding, it is to be feared, from a worſe Cauſe; of which in Reaſon you ſhould ſuſpect your ſelves to be guilty, rather than conclude ſo ſuddenly as you do, our Miniſtry to be unedifying.</p>

                           <p>The very ſame may be ſaid to thoſe who fancy, that though they can profit ſomething by our Miniſtry, yet they can profit more by others. They ought in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to examine whence this Conceit ariſeth; whether it do not proceed from Prejudice, from Diſaffection, from Diſguſt at ſome Doctrine which they love not ſhould be touched, from their ſeldom attendance upon the eſtabliſh'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52190:680"/> Miniſtry, from their careleſs hearing when they were there, or from the haſty Sentence they pronounced againſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſufficient Tryal. And withal, they ſhould conſider what they mean by profiting; whether really and truly they are not more earneſtly preſſed in our Congregations to be thoroughly good and vertuous, to take a ſtrict care to pleaſe God in Thought, Word, and Dred, than they are in thoſe where they imagine they profit more; becauſe they are entertained there, perchance, with more pleaſing Subjects, than this of their whole Chriſtian Duty.</p>
                           <p>I only ſuggeſt this as a thing to be moſt deeply pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and do not accuſe you to be guilty of ſuch Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your own Souls: but this I muſt ſay, That if you do not grow more holy, harmleſs, and unreproveable in your common Converſation, if your Paſſions be not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter governed, if your Tongues be not more ſtrictly bridled, if you grow not more humble, leſs conceited of your ſelves, leſs confident of your own Underſtandings, more fearful to offend God by cenſuring, raſh Judging, diſreſpectful Behaviour to your Betters and Superiours, and ſuch like things, you do but deceive your ſelves with an Opinion of profiting more by the Non-conforming Miniſtry than by ours. Upon which if you would attend with a Mind to improve in theſe great things, I am well aſſured your profiting might appear to all men as well as to your ſelves; who might be convinced, in a little time, there is no need to go any whither elſe for ſuch Edification. And if you go for any other, there will be no end of ſeeking ſtill for better entertainment of your Fancies, and Itching Ears; which will deſire to be gratified with infinite variety.</p>
                           <p>The miſchief of which, they of your own way have felt and complained of as much as we; and the better any of them have been, the more careful have they appeared in giving Cautions againſt this wanton humour, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52190:680"/> never ſo much to Religion, and to growth in Grace, or Soul-ſaving knowledg. In the days of your Fore-fathers, I am ſure, they who could not in all things conform to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> lookt upon this as a dangerous principle, that <hi>men muſt go where they can profit moſt.</hi> And becauſe it is likely that the Opinion of a grave and ſerious perſon, highly eſteemed by all your Party formerly, may prevail with you more than any of ours, give me leave to mind you what Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in ſeveral caſes like to ours, particularly about this, of <hi>Mens leaving their own Paſtors to hear others.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2.

                           </p>
                           <p>Which is a thing worthy your conſideration now; for there is none of your Miniſters dare ſay, that they cannot profit by the Sermons that are commonly preached in our Churches; and therefore ſo may you, if you pleaſe to be impartial, how meanly ſoever you may think of any of our Miniſters; eſpecially if you obſerve this <hi>fourth</hi> thing, which the ſame Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> judiciouſly adds, That.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>The Fruit and Profit which is to be received from the Miniſtry, depends not only nor chifely upon the Gifts of the Man that preaches, but upon the Bleſſing that God is pleaſed to give unto his own Ordinance,</hi> To which he applies thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Who is</hi> Paul? <hi>and who is</hi> Apollo? <hi>but Miniſters by whom ye beleived, even as the Lord gave to every Man.

And God doth oft give a greater Bleſſing to weake than to ſtronger means: and therefoer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52190:681"/> conſider, ſaith he, the Fault may be rather in thy ſelf than in the Preacher, that thou canſt not profit. <hi>And indeed, how ſhouldſt thou profit by his Miniſtry, if thou come with Prejudice, without any Reverence or Delight unto it, and doſt ſcarce acknowledg God's Ordinance in it, nor ever ſeek to God for his Bleſſing upon it;</hi> but look wholly at the Man who preaches?</p>
                           <p>To conclude this, he obſerves the great want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that appears in this ſort of Chriſtians, in the choice they make of their Teachers, and the applauſe they give unto them; which ſhews how neceſſary it is they ſhould be confined commonly to their own. For as ſome admire and follow another rather than their own Paſtor, becauſe he can make more oſtentation of Eloquence, Reading, Learning, and ſuch like humane Gifts than their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor doth, (upon which account the <hi>Corinthians</hi> preferred ſundry Teachers before St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf) ſo there are thoſe who leave their own Paſtor and go to others, <hi>only for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties ſake.</hi> Though their own have never ſuch excellent Gifts, yet can they not like any one Man long; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving itching Ears, muſt have an heap of Teachers.

                           <p>I omit other things upon this Subject, which you may find in his 58th. <hi>Lecture</hi> upon the 4th. of St. <hi>John.</hi> Where he admits indeed that a man may ſome time go from his own Pariſh Church to hear another whoſe gifts he more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:682"/> admires: But then (like a judicious Divine) adds this notable obſervation, to correct and regulate this liberty; that it may not prove an evil Humour; viz. <hi>He only makes right uſe of the benefit of hearing ſuch as have more excellent Gifts than his own Paſtor, as learns thereby to like his own Paſtor the better, and to profit more by him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Mark it, I moſt earneſtly intreat you, together with his Illuſtration of it, by this Example; <hi>The excellent Gifts God hath beſtowed on others, in this caſe may be fitly reſembled unto Phyſick: which they uſe well, whoſe appitite is thereby amended; and are made able to relliſh and like their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary food the better.</hi> If after men have heard one of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gifts, they begin to diſtaſte the Miniſtry of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors, and can like of none, profit by none, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have rare Gifts: they become at length like to thoſe, who by accuſtoming themſelves to drink hot and ſtrong Waters, bring their Stomacks to that paſs, that they can find no Reliſh or Vertue in any Drink or Water, be it never ſo hot or ſtrong. Believe it; they receive no true profit from the moſt admired Preacher, who learn not by hearing him, to profit by any one that delivers to them the wholeſome Words of our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the Doctrine that is according unto Godlineſs: though in the plaineſt manner imaginable, both for Method and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                           <p>This I have choſen to write in his Words, becauſe, there are ſome, I fear, that would ſcarce indure ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from us: which may, at leaſt, be more reverently received, and duly conſidered (proceeding from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch note heretofore among Nonconformiſts) and beget ſo much Sobriety in you all, as to make you think <hi>what manner of Spirit you are now of?</hi> How you come to differ ſo much, from the beſt of your own way in former dayes? This is worth your ſerious ſtudy, that you may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:682"/> not offend, as many hearers do, <hi>in a partial and factious eſtimation they have the Miniſters of the Goſpel in.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They are his Words again, in another place. <hi>Lecture</hi> LXVI. Where he obſerves this partiality ariſes from <hi>two</hi> Grounds. Firſt, the <hi>reſpect they have to difference of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that is among us, in ſmaller matters, which makes them affect ſuch only as are of their own Mind in every thing; with the diſlike of all others that are of a contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion. And ſecondly, <hi>from the reſpect they have to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Gifts which is among Preachers</hi> (of which I ſpake before) which moves them to admire ſome, whom they judge to be of excellent gifts (though alas, their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very ſmall) but to diſpiſe and contemn all others. And he hath there theſe <hi>two</hi> remarkable reflections upon this Humour which I beg of you to obſerve and remember.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, that <hi>this factious Diſpoſition of the Hearers of Gods Word, hath in all ages been the cauſe of much Confuſion in the Church of God and greatly hindred the fruit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Note here. This way which you are in is not the means of profiting in Religion, but of hindering the growth and increaſe of it.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>ſecond is,</hi> that <hi>whereas they in whom this humor reigneth are wont to glory as if they had more Judgment, and could diſcern better of Gifts than other men</hi> (ſaying, alas! poor People who eſteem ſo highly of ſuch a mans Gifts; If they had any Judgment or underſtanding, they would count him no body) <hi>The Apoſtle tells us, it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that this argues rather they have very little Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Grace in them: yea, this makes them uncapable of profiting by the Word.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1.</p>
                           <p>O that there were an Heart in you, to ponder ſuch Profitable Inſtructions as theſe! which were ſaid on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to check that evil Diſpoſition which began then to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52190:683"/> appear among People inclinable to Non-conformity; and is ſince grown the prevailing humour: inſomuch, that ſome can ſettle no where, but ramble from one Preacher to another, as their uncertain Fancy guides them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out becoming one whit the better for any.</p>
                           <p>Yes, will ſome ſay; We might be perſwaded to come and hear your Preachers, and hear them conſtantly, but we ought not to be compelled to it; that's a thing you can never juſtifie. To which ſo much hath been anſwered by others, that I ſhall only tell you what that good Man before named ſaith to it, in one of thoſe Lectures which was preached in <hi>Parliament-time, May</hi> 8. 1610. where he takes occaſion to ſtir up the People to pray earneſtly for the States of the Realm then aſſembled; that their principal care might be to take order about two things; <hi>firſt,</hi> That an able and conſcionable Miniſtry may be placed every where; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that ALL People may be compelled to hear. <hi>For it is certain</hi> (ſaith he upon this ſecond head) <hi>that where there is a good Miniſtry eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the Magiſtrate may and ought to compell ALL Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to come and hear; notwithſtanding all pretence of their Conſciences to the contrary.</hi>

                           <p>To ſum up all then that hath been ſaid in this Buſineſs. Be pleaſed to conſider, <hi>What makes a Sermon profitable;</hi> and, <hi>What muſt be done by the People to profit by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A Sermon is then profitable when it informs the Mind and Judgment aright in Divine Truth; when it inſtructs you in any part of the Chriſtian Duty; when it tends to ſtrengthen or awaken your Faith, that you may more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly adhere, and earneſtly apply your ſelves to what you know and believe certainly to be Gods Mind and Will;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52190:683"/> when it works upon the Will and the Affections to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit intirely to Gods Will, that you may bring forth the fruit of a holy Life; when it corrects any of your Errors; ſtirs up your Sloth; incourages you to Diligence, Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and Perſeverance, and ſuch like things.</p>
                           <p>But the beſt contrived Sermon in the World for all theſe ends, though it were indited by the Spirit of God it ſelf; would have no efficacy at all in it, if they that heard it, did not attend to it; and attend without Prejudice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Paſſion, without Partiality, without raſh and haſty Judgment, without Pride and conceit of themſelves, and their own Knowledge and Righteouſneſs: that is, unleſs they conſider and weigh what is delivered, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their preſent ſence, unleſs they will impartially give every thing that is offered to their mind a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; and allot ſome time for its further Conſideration, when it is not to their liking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For want of which, multitudes did not Profit by our Saviour's Sermons, but were rather more exaſperated by them: and at laſt finally hardned againſt him, and againſt the Holy Ghoſt, when it came down from Heaven to convince them.</p>
                           <p>I doubt not they were ready enough then to lay the blame upon his Sermons, which preſſed them to many things, unto which they had no mind; being againſt their Intereſt, or againſt ſome Opinion, or Affection, to which they were deeply ingaged: ſo that they did not Profit by them. But for all this, you believe the fault was wholly in themſelves, who ought to have come better prepared; with honeſt and good Hearts to hear his Word. And therefore have reaſon to conſider in your preſent caſe, that ſince the moſt Profitable Sermons that ever were made, can do no good, unleſs Men be diſpoſed to Profit by them: whether the unprofitableneſs you complain of under our Miniſtry, do not ariſe rather for want of what you ought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:684"/> to do to make the moſt excellent Sermon profitable, then from any defect in their Miniſtry.</p>
                           <p>Judg now I ſay, upon the whole: if you cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the publick Miniſtry; where is it moſt reaſonable to think the cauſe of this unprofitableneſs lies? whether to ſuſpect the cauſe may lie in your ſelves; or to impute it to their Sermons, and conclude them to be unedyfying. Pronounce, I beſeech you, righteous Judgment, after you have well weighed the matter: and give ſuch things as I have here laid before you, a juſt and deliberate Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: ſo as hereafter to reſolve to lay aſide all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and to be perfectly free to hear with Patience and Candor, what can be ſaid by any body; though againſt your preſent perſuaſion. Let not your Paſſions riſe at it; or if they do, immediately ſuppreſs them, and require them not to meddle in this matter: but to ſumbit unto what ſhall appear to be reaſon, after you have weighed the matter impartially.</p>
                           <p>If you cannot do this, you ought to think that you have not profited much, by all the Sermons you have heard: and conſequently ſuſpect, you are in a wrong way of growing wiſer and better. And after you have brought your ſelf to much liberty, I doubt not you will find that you are in a wrong way; and therefore reſolve to alter it, and come into the way of the Church. Where if you do not meet preſently with ſuch advantages for your Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual growth, as you are told you may receive, you have reaſon to conclude, as the forenamed Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> doth to thoſe, that ſaid they could not find ſuch Lights, ſuch Power, ſuch Comfort in the Word, as was ſpoken of. <hi>Firſt, either you have not ſought it aright, not with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or not with a good Heart: or Secundly, if you have and do not find it at firſt; yet you ſhall hereafter, if you ſeek it here with an honeſt heart.</hi>

                           <p>And the preaching of Gods holy Word among us, would be of greater efficacy upon your Hearts; if when you come to partake of it, you would remember and obſerve ſome Rules (delivered by the ſame Author in another place, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture XXVI.) about the Publick Worſhip of God, which now, alas, are generally neglected; and therefore had need to be preſſed, for the diſpoſing all Mens Hearts to profit by their attendance on it.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. One is, that <hi>at your coming into the Congregation, and during the whole time of your abode there, you would behave your ſelves reverently.</hi> For we may not come into the place of Gods Worſhip, as we would into a dancing-School, or Play-Houſe, laughing or toying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither may we go out of it, as we would out of ſuch a one: but in our very coming in, and going out, and whole outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage there, we ought to give ſome ſignification of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that we bear to this Place; and that we do indeed account it the Houſe of God.</p>
                           <p>Which ſerious temper of Mind, and awful ſenſe of Gods Preſence, poſſeſſing the Mind, would, no doubt, be an excellent preparation to receive benefit by the whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God as well as by the Sermon. For which end,</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Another Rule is, that <hi>we muſt all come to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods publick worſhip, and carry till all be done. Yea, it is the Duty of Gods People, ſaith he, to be in Gods Houſe before the beginning: For it becomes them to wait for the Miniſter of God, and not to let him wait for them.</hi> The Reaſons he gives for this are <hi>two.</hi> Firſt, there is Nothing done in our Aſſemblies, but all may receive profit by it. For example, <hi>by the confeſſion of Sins</hi> (and Abſolution, I may add) <hi>and all other Prayers uſed in the Congregation, a man may receive more profit and comfort, than by any other.</hi>
                              <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:685"/> Which is the reaſon why the Apoſtles (even after Chriſts Aſcention, when the typical Honour of the Temple was aboliſhed, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> were ſo delighted to go to the Temple to pray, at the times of publick Prayer. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And ſo he goes on to ſhew how by <hi>hearing the Word read</hi> all may profit: and by hearing it <hi>preached,</hi> even by the meaneſt Miniſter of Chriſt, if the fault be not in themſelves. How the <hi>ſinging of Pſalms</hi> alſo furthers the fruit of the Word in the Hearts of Believers: and much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit may the faithful receive by <hi>the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> Nay, by being preſent at the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> all may receive profit: being put in mind there-by of the Covenant God made with them in Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c. Laſtly,</hi> by the <hi>bleſſing pronounced</hi> by Gods Miniſter all may receive good; and therefore none ought to abſent himſelf from any part of the publick Service of God.</p>
                           <p>For which his <hi>ſecond</hi> Reaſon is very remarkable, that <hi>though we could receive no profit by the Exerciſes uſed in our Aſſemblies, yet we muſt be preſent at them all, to do our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage unto God; and ſhew the reverent reſpect we have to his Ordinances. For there is nothing done in Gods publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among us</hi> (obſerve this) <hi>but it is done by the Inſtruction and Ordinance and Commandment of the Lord.</hi> As he ſhews particularly, that it is his ordinance there ſhould <hi>be all ſorts and kinds of Prayers uſed;</hi> yea, this is the chief duty to be performed in our aſſemblies, 1 K. 11. 1, 2. that in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick aſſemblies <hi>the Word of God ſhould be read</hi> as well as preached, <hi>the Holy Communion</hi> adminiſtred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, all things ſhould be done as they are now in our <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> to which it is plain he hath reſpect. And this he repeats again, Lecture XXVIII.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>If thou waſt ſure thou couldſt not profit, yet muſt thou come to do thy Homage to God, and to ſhew thy reverence to his Ordinance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Another of his general Rules is, that <hi>when we are</hi>
                              <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52190:685"/> 
                              <hi>preſent we ought to joyn with the Congregation in all the parts of Gods Worſhip, and do as the Congregation doth.</hi> For it makes much for the come lineſs and reverence of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that all things be done in good order, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. And it is a principle part of this good order that ſhould be in the Congregation; when they all come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and go together, pray together, ſing together, kneel together: in a word, when every part of Gods Worſhip is to be performed by the Congregation, as if the whole Congregation were but one Man.</p>
                           <p>And in ſeveral places he reproves with a great deal of Zeal, mens great careleſsneſs in this; particularly their neglect of kneeling in the Prayers: having obſerved that men who will kneel at their own private prayers <hi>can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſeen to kneel at the common and publick Prayer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>His laſt general Rule is, <hi>that we ought to teach our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants to ſhew Reverence to the Sanctuary and publick Worſhip of God.</hi> For God cannot indure profaneneſs and contempt of Religion, no not in Children. And it ſtands us all upon to uſe the utmoſt Authority we have to maintain the <hi>Reverence of Gods Sanctuary:</hi> for the open contempt done by any, may bring Gods curſe on us all. <hi>And certainly, ſaith he, among other cauſes of the Plauge, and other Judgments of God upon the Land, this is not the leaſt, that Gods publick Worſhip is performed among us with ſo little Reverence and Devotion as it is.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I am tempted to tranſcribe a great deal more of theſe <hi>Lectures:</hi> becauſe by them you may ſee that if I had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all that hath been ſaid about our Sermons, I might (according to the Judgment of this devout and learned man) have maintain'd that there wants not ſufficient means of profiting in our Congregations, if there were none: as long as the word of God is there read, by which (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other holy duties) all may receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt profit and comfort, if they pleaſe. For it is of far
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52190:686"/> greater excellence, authority and certainty, than the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of any Preacher in the World. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it comes more immediately from God: and though it be tranſlated by men, yet is there in it far leſs mixture of humane Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Infirmity than in Sermons. While the Word is <hi>read</hi> we are ſure we hear God ſpeaking to us, and that it is the truth that we hear, but not alway ſo, when men <hi>preach:</hi> for the beſt man is ſubject to Error. (which by the way ſhews the great ignorance and profaneneſs of this Age; wherein men make nothing of the <hi>reading</hi> of Gods Word, but take the liberty to diſcourſe and chat all the time while the firſt and ſecond Leſſons are read to them.)</p>
                           <p>And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the Word that is read, is the Foundation of all Sermons; and the very touch-ſtone whereby they are to be tryed. To that which we hear <hi>read</hi> ſimple and abſolute Obedience is due, without any queſtion made of the truth and certainty of it: but ſo it is not to that which we hear <hi>preached,</hi> farther than we find it agreeable to the written Word; for they of <hi>Beraea</hi> were commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for examining by this even that which the Apoſtles themſelves did preach.</p>

                           <p>But I ſay no more of this: and ſhall only crave leave, with ſome earneſtneſs, to deſire <hi>two</hi> things of every one who ſaith he cannot profit by our Sermons.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that he would examine himſelf ſtrictly upon this Queſtion; whether he thinks he could profit by ſuch a Sermon as this; did he hear it preached by one of your Miniſters? Search to the very bottom of your Hearts and be not ſatisfied till you feel how they ſtand affected, and how they would receive a diſcourſe upon theſe Subjects; ſhould you come occaſionally (as you now ſpeak) into one of our Churches, and there find the Preacher preſſing theſe things upon the Peoples Conſciences? Eſpecially if
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:686"/> you heard him add to theſe Rules, that <hi>for the reverence of Gods publick worſhip, care ſhould be taken that the place where the Congregation aſſembleth, may be decent and comely.</hi> And he ſhould call this place, a <hi>Temple;</hi> and affirm that Gods publick worſhip, is no where ſo well performed as in this Temple: and that it is a foul ſin and contempt done to Gods worſhip, that Pariſhioners either will not be at the chrage to maintain ſuch as may keep the Church decently, or are altogether careleſs to ſee it done: and that the true cauſe why now adays Men will be at no coſt with Gods Houſe, is, becauſe they have no delight in it; and that this is a piece of irreligiouſneſs, which is a juſt cauſe of grief to every godly man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Reflect, I ſay, upon your ſelves, and reſolve, what you really think you would judge of ſuch a Sermon? How would it be accepted by you?</p>
                           <p>Would be apt to look upon it as altogether unprofitable? or at leaſt, as needleſs diſcourſe; which might as well, nay better, be ſpared, than preached to the People?</p>
                           <p>If this be your mind, then conſider with your ſelves, why ſuch things out of one mans mouth ſhould reliſh well enough, or go down without diſguſt; which coming out of anothers you preſently diſlike? Is it not manifeſt that you are partial and diſaffected; and that this is the reaſon you cannot profit by our Sermons? Or if you could not like ſuch diſcourſes, either from Nonconformiſts, or from our Miniſters; then conſider, whether you have not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think you are very much miſtaken in this buſineſs of <hi>profitable Sermons:</hi> when you imagine ſuch diſcourſes as theſe to be unprofitable and ſuperfluous, which in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſober men of all ſides, are not only very uſeful, but ſo neceſſary to be taught the People; that for want of a ſenſe of ſuch things, they are in danger to loſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? For, as that good man ſaid long ago (and I doubt we are much improved in ſuch impiety ſince that time, <hi>as Superſtition made the Papiſts too careful, and too bountiful:</hi>
                              <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52190:687"/> 
                              <hi>ſo Profaneneſs and Atheiſm hath made us too void of all care, in beautifying the Houſe of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. But if you think that you ſhould count ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profitable, then I deſire you, <hi>Secondly,</hi> to examine your ſelves and conſider; whether you have learnt ſo much out of the Holy Scriptures, as to obſerve all the foregoing Rules duly and carefully? or ſo much, as to make them your ſtudy, and to think how to bring your Heart into conformity with them? Do you, for inſtance, reverence God's Sanctuary? and when you come into it, and while you are there, give open ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of it? Do you come at the beginning of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, or only to ſome part of it, at the latter end, or the Sermon only? Do you ſtand up, and do you kneel when the reſt of the Congregation doth? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>If you cannot ſay that you are ſo well acquainted with theſe, and the reſt of the foregoing Rules, as to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live by them; then in reaſon, you ought to conclude, that the fault is ſome where elſe, and not in our Sermons, if you cannot profit by them: For you do not profit by the Holy Scriptures themſelves.</p>
                           <p>Where theſe things are ſo plainly taught, that a Man ought to think very meanly of himſelf, and to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf as a poor proficient in Religion; who is not advanced thus far in his regard to the Duties, and the Solemnities of God's Worſhip and Service.</p>
                           <p>And, if being admoniſhed of theſe things, he do not humble himſelf; nay, become vile in his own Eyes, for having thus long entertained an high opinion of himſelf, though ſo deficient in the very rudiments and beginnings of Religion; he is not likely to be much the better for any Sermon whatſoever: becauſe he will reliſh none but thoſe only, which feed his vain conceit of himſelf; and of his high attainments, and intimate acquaintance with God, and communion with him in his Ordinances; while
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:687"/> he hath not a due eſteem of them, nor makes a right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement by them.</p>

                           <p>But I hope theſe ſhort Admonitions may put better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, into thoſe Mens minds; who will ſeriouſly think of them: and particularly beget in them a greater regard, than is uſually given to the Holy Word of God, <hi>read</hi> in our Churches. Which will diſpoſe ever one to profit better by all Sermons (which are but the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Application of that Word) eſpecially, if, with due devotion of heart, they will joyn in the whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice foregoing. By which they may profit (I have ſhown) as much, if not more, as by Sermons; if they be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpoſed, and will come at the beginning of the Prayers, and with all humble reverence attend upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of God's Worſhip.</p>
                           <p>For as he that is away from any part of the Sermon (ſays the ſame Perſon again) ſhall profit the leſs by that which he doth hear; ſo he that is away from any part of the Divine Service, gets the leſs good by that at which he is preſent. For there is no part of God's Service (not the <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> not the <hi>Prayers,</hi> not the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> not the <hi>Bleſſing)</hi> but it concerns every one; and every one may receive edification by it; and will loſe much of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit he might have had, if he abſent himſelf from it. A thing in which it ſeems, many of them, who had <hi>moſt knowledg and were the forwardeſt Profeſſors</hi> in thoſe days, did offend: which moved him to ſet out the ſins of thoſe Men in ſeveral Reſpects and Conſiderations. Which it would be too long for me to mention; nor is it needful, if this that I have diſcourſed already be laid to Heart. And if Men will lay nothing cloſe to their Conſciences; all that can be ſaid, or wrote, or preached, will do them no good: but they will be only hearers, or readers, not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52190:688"/> doers of the Word, deceiving their own Souls.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Wherefore laying aſide</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, I. II. 1. 2.) <hi>all malice, and all guile</hi> (or deceit) <hi>and hypocriſies, and envies, and all evil ſpeakings, as new born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the Word</hi> (or that rational ſincere milk; the pure food of your mind and underſtanding, and not of your fancy) <hi>that you may grow thereby.</hi> As certainly you will, when you become of the ſame diſpoſition, with little Children: void of hatred, of guile, of wraths of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, and ſuch like evil affections: and are of an humble, teachable, and ſubmiſſive Spirit. For if every one had but ſuch <hi>an increaſe of grace, as to hear meekly Gods Word, and to receive it with pure affection,</hi> they could not eaſily fail, to <hi>bring forth the fruit of the Spirit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So we pray in our Litany. And may it pleaſe God, as it there follows; to <hi>bring into the way of truth, all ſuch as have erred, and are deceived:</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake.</p>

                        <head>AN ARGUMENT FOR UNION, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p>I Take it for granted (ſeeing a Truth ſo very plain <note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> needs no formal Proof) that the ready way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow a Church, is, firſt to divide it. It is, alſo, too manifeſt, that our Diſſentions are <hi>Diviſions,</hi> properly ſo called, or Publick Ruptures. It is true, notwithſtanding theſe Ruptures, the Church ſtill lives, and, in ſome good meaſure, proſpers: But how Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal theſe Breaches may, at laſt, prove, through their Continuance and Increaſe, a Man, who has but a Competency of Judgment, may eaſily fortel. It is, therefore, the buſineſs of every Good Man, as far as in him lies, to diſſwade, with Prudent Zeal, from theſe Diviſions; which are, in their Nature ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and ſo perillous in their Conſequence.</p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:691"/>
                        <p>Now, one way of moving Men to deſiſt from their Undertakings, is, the ſhewing of them, with calmneſs of Temper, and plainneſs of Reaſoning, that their <hi>Ends</hi> are not likely to be obtain'd: As alſo, that by the <hi>Means</hi> they uſe, they will bring upon themſelves thoſe very Evils which they fear, and of the removal of which they have Expectation.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, I have choſen an <hi>Argument</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in order to the perſuading of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to joyn in the Exerciſe of <hi>Conſtant Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And I have here endeavoured to make it evident to them; that, in attempting to pull down this <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Church,</hi> they, unwarily, turn their own force againſt themſelves, and prepare Materials for the Tombs of their own Parties.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> is here offer'd to them in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſtian Charity, and without any deſign of expoſing or exaſperating any perſon who differs, in his Notions, from the ſenſe of the Writer. For he had rather lie at the Feet of the meaneſt Man who is overtaken with an errour, than ſpurn inſolently againſt him.</p>
                        <p>Now, in the managing of this Argument, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf. Its Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Method.</note> to ſhew two things.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>What thoſe Ends are which are propoſed by the Diſſenters?</hi> I mean, <hi>thoſe</hi> which ſeem, with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable colour of Reaſon, fit to be propoſed; and which are deſigned by the better and wiſer of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>What Reaſons may make it manifeſt, that the Ends which they propoſe, can never be procured by the Diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Or, <hi>(Secondly)</hi> as ſeveral diſtinct Churches, giving undiſturbed Toleration to one another.</p>
                        <p>For I am not willing to believe all of them to be given up to ſuch a degree of Infatuation, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only upon beating down, without conſidering what is fit to be ſet up. That is the way of Tempeſts, and not of Builders.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Principal</hi> is, the further Advancement of the Reformed Religion. This alſo, hath two parts.</p>

                        <p>For <hi>All of them</hi> to expect to be united in one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Body, is to hope, not only againſt the Grounds of Hope, but of Poſſibility.</p>
                        <p>For the Parties are very many, and very differing, (or rather very contrary) and they cannot frame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, any common Scheme in which their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents can be united.</p>

I may add, the Body of the People of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> renders them tenacious of their Antient Cuſtoms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> All the Parties amongſt us, have of late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, for Mutual Forbearance. They cannot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be conſiſtent with themſelves, if they frame ſuch a National Conſtitution, by which any Man, who Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from it, ſhall be otherwiſe dealt with, than by perſonal Conference; which, alſo, he muſt have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty not to admit, if he be perſuaded it is not fit or ſafe for him. And ſuch a Body without any other nerves for its ſtrength and motion; for the Encouragement of thoſe who are Members of it, and the Diſcouragement of thoſe who refuſe its Communion, will not long hold together: Nor hath it means in it, ſufficient for the Ends to which it is deſigned. And indeed by this means, the Spiritual Power of Excommunication will be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of none Effect. For, what Puniſhment, what Shame, what Check, will it be to Croſs and Perverſe Men, if being ſhut out of the <hi>National Church,</hi> they may with open Arms and with Applauſe due to real Converts, be received into this or the other particular Congregation, as it beſt ſuiteth with their good like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Furthermore,</hi> it is commonly ſaid, that ſince the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> have gathered Churches out of Churches, there are not many true and proper <hi>Diſciplinarians</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it be ſo, then <hi>Independency</hi> is amongſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> the prevalent ſide; and I know not how a <hi>National Church</hi> can be made up of Separate Independent Churches; for each Congregation is a Church by it ſelf, and hath, beſides the general Covenant of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, a particular Church-Covenant; and therefore, it is difficult to imagine how all of them can be, by any Coherence of the Parts, united into one intire So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                        <p>But, be it ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Diſciplinarians</hi> are of all Parties, the moſt numerous and prevalent; yet <hi>Experience</hi> ſheweth how hard a Work it is for all of them to form themſelves into a Church of <hi>England,</hi> In the late times of Publick diſquiet, they had great Power; they had in humane appearance, fair and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Opportunities; and yet there grew up at their Roots another Party, which in concluſion, over-dropped them, and brought their Intereſt into a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decay; it being the nature of every Faction, upon Victory obtain'd over their Common Adverſary, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divide.

                        <p>In Sum, the longer the Church of <hi>England</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled, the greater daily grew the confuſion; and the diviſion of Sects was multiplyed, not unlike to that of Winds in the Mariners Compaſs, in which Artiſts have increas'd the Partitions, from four to two and thirty. Inſomuch, that the very Diſtractions which were among us did in ſome meaſure, prepare the way for the return of the King, and the Reſtitution of the Church: men finding no other common Bottom on which the Intereſts of Religion and civil Peace might be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>Now, if the Diſſenters could not then, when ſo fair Opportunities were in their hands, carry on their cauſe to any tolerable Settlement; much leſs may they now hope to do it.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is not at this time, ſuch an Union amongſt Diſſenters, as appeared at the beginning of our late Troubles. The number of thoſe Diſſenters
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52190:695"/> who were not for the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> was then very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe who then favoured the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> are much departed from their former Scheme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, inclining to <hi>Independency,</hi> which they once denyed to be <hi>God's Ordinance</hi>

                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> At the beginning of our Diſturbances, many Men of Quality, and ſuch who had a Zeal of God, favour'd the Settlement of the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in the ſimplicity of their hearts. They had not then ſeen any Revolutions; they had not diſcovered the ſecret Springs of publick Motions; nor the vile Intereſts of many men which lay concealed under the diſguiſe of <hi>Pure Religion.</hi> They ſaw (what all Men may ſee in all times) abuſes in Church and State; and the very name of <hi>Reformation</hi> was ſweet to them.</p>
                        <p>Now, notwithſtanding the ſincere zeal and the power of theſe Men, the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> could not long be carried on; much leſs could it be perfected by them.</p>
                        <p>There is therefore at this time, a much greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of Succeſs in the like deſign.

                        <p>Alſo, ſince thoſe days, through the luxation of Diſcipline during the licence of the War, the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of great and black Hypocriſies, the multiplication of Parties and Opinions, the publiſhing of many lewd and irreligious books from Unlicens'd Preſſes, <hi>Atheiſm</hi> hath made very formidable Advances. And they ſay, that ſome undiſguiſed <hi>Sceptics</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> have, ſome times ſince the King's Return, been much uſed in the Cauſe of our Diſſenters. Now, if well meaning zeal could not eſtabliſh the Diſcipline, it is not likely to be promoted, much leſs ſettled, by the help of ſuch hands of which the outſides are not waſhed by ſo much as an External form of Godlineſs.</p>

                        <p>This ſeems not probable upon many accounts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some Diſſenters believe ſome of the Parties to be incapable of Forbearance, as maintaining Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deſtructive of Chriſtian Faith and Piety.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> There is no firmneſs or ſocial influence in the nature of this Union. It is the Union of a multitude who meet and diſperſe at pleaſure. And he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this way as the means to knit Men into Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion, is like a Projecter who ſhould deſign the keeping of the ſtones together in the ſtrength of a firm and laſting Houſe, by forbearing the uſe of <hi>Cement.</hi> The Union that laſteth, is that of the Concord of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in an Uniform Body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moreover,</hi> It is to be conſider'd, that there are no Parties in this or any other Nation, ſo exactly poiſed, that they have equal <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Intereſts.</hi> There is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:697"/> always one of them which over-ballanceth the reſt. And one of the ſeveral ways muſt always be favoured as the Religion of the State. And it is natural for the ſtrongeſt ſide to attempt the ſubduing of the weaker. And though this be not ſoon effected; yet 'till one ſide getteth the maſtery, the Parties remain, not as diſtinct Bodies ſettled in peace within themſelves, and towards each other, but as Convulſions in the common body of the State.</p>
                        <p>Some think this Inclination to the ſwallowing up of all other Parties to be found almoſt only in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>But here is ſomething of it to be diſcerned (I will not ſay in all Churches, ſeeing I well underſtand the good Being of our own) which ſuffered <hi>Bonner</hi> himſelf to live, yet in all Factions and Parties; though the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Power makes it not ſeem to be alike in all of them.</p>
                        <p>The Catt hath the ſame inward Parts with the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they differ much in ſize: And ſome ſuch likewiſe they will find who diſſect humane nature, and Bodies civil.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There is this Diſpoſition in Men, whether they be the politick, or the Conſcientious.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The External practice of all Parties is anſwerable to this inward Diſpoſition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There is this inward Diſpoſition in men who eſpouſe any Faction, whether their Ends be deſigns of State, or of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Parties who are not (otherwiſe than in ſhew) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for Religion, will perpetually covet Power af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Power. And Parties who are ſerious and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious in their way, whatſoever it is; will not remain in an indifference of terms towards thoſe who tread in contrary Paths, and with whom they do not maintain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52190:697"/> Communion. For therefore they withdraw from them, becauſe they believe Communion with them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. Otherwiſe they have no Judgment in the price of Peace and Unity, if they willingly part with it, when they may, without ſin, enjoy it: and if they eſteem their way ſinful, and believe thoſe perſons who remain without their pale, to be ſo gone aſtray, as without Repentance, to be eternally loſt; Charity it ſelf will urge them to uſe all means probable towards the reducing of them. And they will be apt to think, that the ſuffering of them in their Wandrings, declares them to be contented with their condition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>External Practice of all Parties do's ſhew plainly what is their inward Diſpoſition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All would do what is good in their own eyes; but I do not perceive that any are willing to let others do ſo. Where there is Power, their is little Forbearance: And the ſame men as their Conditions alter, ſpeak of <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Juſtice.</hi>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> the deſign of keeping out Popery by the Ruine of this Church, is like the prepoſterous way, of ſecuring the Vineyard by pulling up of the Fence; or of keeping out the Enemy by the removal of our <hi>Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</hi> Under that name this Church is commonly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and they do not flatter it who give it that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ts Conſtitution is Chriſtian, and it is ſtrong in its Nature; and if ſuch a Church hath not ability (with God's aſſiſtance) to reſiſt the aſſaults of <hi>Romiſh Power,</hi> much leſs have they who diſſent from it. And it is <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm</hi> properly ſo called, or Religious <hi>Frenzie,</hi> to lay aſide a more probable means, and to truſt that God will give, to means which are much leſs probable, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aid and ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>God ſupporteth a good Cauſe by weak means (if they are the only means he hath put into our power) againſt a bad Cauſe, though externally potent. But he, who in caſes of emergence aſſiſteth honeſt Impotence and Infirmity, will never work Miracles in favour of Mens Preſumptions and Indiſcretions.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are a mighty body of Men; and, though there are Inteſtine Fewds betwixt the Secular and Regular Clergy, as likewiſe betwixt the ſeveral Orders, yet they are all united into one common Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and grafted, into that one ſtock of the Papal Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52190:700"/> They are favoured in many places by great Men; they have variety of Learning; they pretend to great Antiquity, to Miracles, to Martyrs without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to extraordinary Charity and Mortification; they have the Nerves of worldly Power, that is, banks of Money, and a large Revenue: They have a Scheme of Policy always in readineſs; there are great numbers of Emiſſaries poſted in all places for the conveying of Intelligence, and the gaining of Proſelytes; they take upon them all ſhapes, and are bred to all the wordly Arts of Inſinuation.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52190:700"/> The Character is this. <hi>As to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>purged from Forein wicked Superſtitious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Errors, either Impious or dangerous, by the Rule of the Divine Scriptures; approved by ſo many and ſuch illuſtrious Martyrs; abounding with Piety towards God, and Charity towards Men, and with moſt frequent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good works; flouriſhing with an increaſe of moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wiſe men from the beginning of the Reformation to this time; I have always had it in juſt eſteem, and till I die, I ſhall continue in the ſame due Veneration of it.

                        <p>Now, is it probable that ſuch a Church as this is, ſhould have leſs ſtrength in it for the reſiſting of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, than an inferior number of divided Parties, of which the moſt Sober and moſt Accompliſh'd, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo Primitive, nor ſo learned, nor ſo united, nor ſo numerous, nor ſo legal: And againſt which it will be objected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it is of Yeſterday?</p>
                        <p>Amongſt theſe Parties, <hi>there are ſome who have not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared themſelves.</hi> And who knows whether they have not a Reſerve for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, againſt a favourable Opportunity, though ſometimes they ſpeak of <hi>Rome</hi> as of <hi>Babylon?</hi> I mean thoſe People who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who ſpeak in general of their <hi>Light;</hi> and in ſuch doubtful manner, that Inquiſitive Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet underſtand from what quarter of the Heavens it ſhineth.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> There are ſome who though they have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves againſt Popery, yet they have ſcarce any formed way of keeping it out. For what hindreth a crafty Jeſuit from gathering a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of many others, and modelling of it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees according to his pleaſure? and what a gap do they leave open for Seducers, who take out of the way all Legal Teſts, and admit Men who are Strangers to them to officiate amongſt them upon bare pretence of Spiritual Illumination?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Furthermore,</hi> the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have more powerful ways of drawing Men from the Parties of the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> than they have of enticing them from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for ſuch Men (too frequently) go out from us through weakneſs of imagination, for which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath variety of Gratifications.</p>
                        <p>They will offer, to the <hi>Severe,</hi> ſuch ſtrictneſſes as are not conſiſtent with the general Laws of a National Church, which being framed for Men of ſuch various <hi>Conditions,</hi> muſt have ſome Scope and Latitude, though no licence in it; and many of thoſe who now joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Diſſenting Parties, would then chuſe to be admitted as Members of this or the other Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fraternity: And it is (at leaſt) my private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that if the Revenue of the Religious Houſes which were diſſolved, had been judiciouſly applyed to the ſervice of Men, either weak in mind, or indiſpoſed by temper, or ſingular in their <hi>Inclinations,</hi> amongſt the Reformed; there might have been a Diverſity here (I mean ſuch as there is in our preſent Colleges) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Schiſm.</p>

A <hi>Romiſh</hi> Preacher comes forth out of an obſcure Cloyſter into the Pulpit, and appears all heavenly in the Exerciſe: And having excited a warmth in their affection, he retires again, and does not mix with Converſation, and is not obſerved (as other Miniſters) by many eyes; and the People never ſeeing him but in this Divine Figure, look upon him as an Angel coming to them out of Heaven, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending thither again.</p>
                        <p>It may be obſerved, alſo, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have greater <hi>ſhews of ſelf-denial</hi> for the moving of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Piety, than the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> They have rough Cords mean Garments, bare Feet, Diſciplines, Whips, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of not touching Money, or enjoying Property; though ſome of theſe are often no other than Arts uſed by ordinary Beggars.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> they have ways, not only of humouring the <hi>infirmity,</hi> but even the <hi>Foppiſhneſs</hi> of Humane Nature. <hi>Proceſſions</hi> and other Rites of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52190:702"/> ſo ordered as to be Games for Diverſion; and the <hi>Maſs with Scenes</hi> pleaſeth, though it be not underſtood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do now think, that Popery may be very eaſily ſubdued by their Arms: But if Recluſes were once crept out of their dark Cells (as Serpents from under the deadly night-ſhade) they would have cauſe to alter their Opinions, and not to think too highly of themſelves, after a wilful removal of the Church of <hi>England</hi> which is ſufficient (under God) for this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. This Church deſigns to make Men good by making them firſt Judicious, as far as means can do it. But ſome others deſire to bring them to their ſide by catching of their Imaginations; and by that way they can neither reform nor fix them. Some new Device ſhall, in time, bring them over to a new Party.</p>
                        <p>Diſſention it ſelf amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> weakneth their Intereſt; and that which weakens one ſide, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens another.</p>
                        <p>And many men, entangled in Controverſy, and wearied with endleſs wrangling, are too apt, for mere eaſe and quiet ſake, to caſt themſelves, in ſervile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, into the Arms of pretended <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our Diſſentions have already introduced too much of that which is the very ſpirit of <hi>Jeſuitiſm,</hi> the doing of Evil that pretended Good may come of it; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a Cauſe by any means, whether they be juſt or unjuſt.</p>
                        <p>Some Diſſenters do accidentally prepare the way for <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion by running into an other extream upon pretence of avoiding Popery; by decrying the Church of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Popiſh;</hi> and by condemning that as <hi>Popiſh</hi> which is Chriſtian and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. [As Epiſcopacy, Liturgy, Obſervations of the Nativity of Chriſt, and other Feſtivals, Reverence of bodily Geſture, particularly in receiving the Holy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52190:702"/> Communion, Preſervation of places and things ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for Holy uſes, with reverend care.] By this means they bring Popery into Reputation. Men will be apt to ſay, if ſuch a Body as the Church of <hi>England</hi> be <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh,</hi> it is ſit we ſit down and conſider of it; for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are not ſo inclined without weighty Reaſons. If the Clergy of it be inclined to that Religion, the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of which, together with great numbers of the Popiſh-Clergy, will diminiſh their preferment; it muſt be the Power of the Truth which moveth them againſt their worldly Intereſt. They will continue their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and ſay further; If ſuch good things as theſe abovementioned be <hi>Romiſh,</hi> and it be lawful to judge of the whole by the parts of it which are before us, ſurely that which is <hi>Popiſh</hi> is alſo Primitive and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. That which we have examin'd is good, and that which we have not, may probably be of the ſame kind,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Hiſtory of our late Revolutions ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Popery will not be ſmother'd in the Ruines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but rather be advanced upon them.</p>
                        <p>It made great Progreſs in the late Times; inſomuch, that the Diſſenters do remove the Odium of the late King's execrable Murther from themſelves, and lay it upon the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> thereby tacitly acknowledging that they had ſo great a power over ſome of them, as to make them to become their Inſtruments for the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Anointed.</hi> For if they will not allow <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> and ſome others of that Order, to have been Diſſenters, properly ſo called; yet certainly they muſt not deny that Name to Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> and many like to them, who appeared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in that very black and inſolent wickedneſs. How far it is true that the Jeſuits influenc'd thoſe Counſels,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52190:703"/> I do not now examine, nor do's my Talent lie in My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of State.

                        <p>For, it removeth Charity which is the Spirit of the Chirſtian Religion. It letteth looſe great numbers who cannot govern themſelves; it moveth men to live <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> to pour Contempt upon the Church of Chriſt; and confirmeth them in their evil courſe.

                        <p>And it is here to be conſidered, that thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from a National Church, do generally make uſe of ſuch Junctures, as are apter to debaſe, than refine Religion. They often move for Alterations in the Church when there is a great heat and ferment in the State: And in ſuch Seaſons, the Form of a Church may be pulled in ſunder, but there is not temper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and coolneſs of unbyaſs'd conſideration to ſet it together to advantage. Such times are the Junctures of State Diſſenters, and amongſt them Revolutions ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally begin, though without the pretence of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, they are not carried on amongſt the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52190:705"/> People. For it will not ſerve their purpoſe to ſay plainly, they are againſt the Government, becauſe the Government is againſt their <hi>Intereſts.</hi> Now, when well meaning Diſſenters are in the hands of ſuch worldly Power, they will not be able to eſtabliſh what they think is ſureſt, but that which pleaſeth their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Leaders.

                        <p>But there are others among the Diſſenters, who, by the <hi>Purity of Religion,</hi> mean a ſimplicity as oppos'd to compoſition, and not to ſuch mixtures as corrupt the Circumſtances, or parts of Worſhip which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are pure. <hi>Quakers</hi> and ſome others believe their way the purer, becauſe they have taken out of it Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and External Forms of Worſhip, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured (as they phraſe it <note n="*" place="margin">G.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If ſeveral contrary Parties be eſtabliſhed by way of ſufferance; no progreſs is likely to be made towards the perfecting of Religion. For the ſuffering of divers Errors is not the way to the reforming of them. One Principle only can be true; and the blending of ſuch as are contrary with it, createth the greateſt of Impurities; a mixture of that which is profane, with that which is ſacred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Many <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are not likely to erect a Model by which Chriſtianity may be improved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, becauſe they lay aſide Rules of diſcretion, and rely not on God's aſſiſtance in the uſe of good means, but depend wholly upon immediate illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the aids of Prudence: And ſome of the more ſober amongſt them, have inclined too much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this extream.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52190:708"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There are already provided in this Church, more probable means for the promoting of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than thoſe which have been propoſed by all, or any of the Diſſenting Parties. It is true, each Church is capable of improvement, by the change of obſolete Words, Phraſes, and Cuſtoms; by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Forms upon new Occaſions; by adjuſting diſcreetly ſome Circumſtantials of External Order. But, to change the Preſent Model for any other that has yet been offered to publick conſideration, is to make a very <hi>injudicious bargain.</hi> There are in it, all the neceſſaries to Faith and Godlineſs; there is preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Primitive Diſcipline, Decency, and Order: And, under the means of it, there are great numbers grown up into ſuch an improvement of Judicious Knowledge and uſeful, prudent, ſerious Piety; that it requireth a Laborious Scrutiny to find Parallels to them in any Nations under the Heavens.</p>
                        <p>I do not take pleaſure in diſtaſtful Compariſons. Yet I ought not (ſure) to paſs by with unthankful negligence, that excellent Spirit which God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up among the Writers and Preachers of this Church; their labours being ſo inſtrumental towards the right information of the Judgment, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the Lives of unprejudic'd Hearers.</p>
                        <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that there is ſome trifling on all ſides: And it will be ſo whilſt Men are Men. But there is now (bleſſed be God) as little of it in the Church of <hi>England</hi> as in any Age. And the very few who do it, appear plainly to be what they are, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticks, and Actors, rather than Preachers. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Parties, the folly and weakneſs puts on a more venerable pretence, and they give vent to it with ſtudied ſhews of mighty ſeriouſneſs, and deliver it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly as the immediate dictate of God's Holy Spirit.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:709"/> And I cannot but call to mind one Miniſter in this Church, who would (for inſtance ſake) have delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately uſed theſe words of Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in a ſolemn audience, <note n="*" place="margin">

                           </note> and after this manner. <hi>God permits Sins, and ſuch ſolemn Sins, that there may be room in the</hi> Play <hi>for pardoning Grace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It ſeemeth alſo, not unfit for me to take notice, that the Changes formerly made in Church-matters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Diſſenters, were not ſo conducive in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, as the things illegally removed. The Doctrine of <hi>God's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decrees</hi> taught in their <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> was a ſtronger and more improper kind of meat than that with which the Church of <hi>England</hi> had fed her Children. <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a Biſhop,</hi> accompany'd with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> was more certain and ſatisfactory than that by Presbyters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop.</p>
                        <p>There was not that ſobriety in many of the preſent and <hi>unſtudied Effuſions,</hi> which appeared in every of thoſe publick Forms which were conſidered and fixed.

                           <p>IF then, Diſſenters are not likely to obtain their Ends, of Eſtabliſhing themſelves, of rooting out of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and promoting pure Religion, by overthrowing the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Inference</hi> is natural, they ought, both in Prudence and Chriſtianity, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with it.</p>
                           <p>They will (it may be) ſay to me, Can Men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded two contrary ways? Can they both <hi>Aſſent and Diſſent?</hi> And whilſt they ſecretly <hi>Diſſent,</hi> would you force them into an Hypocritical Compliance? I <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> thus.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though a Man cannot at the ſame time whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Aſſent and Diſſent;</hi> yet there are means for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of a falſe perſuaſion; and he may, upon good Grounds, change his Mind.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> No Man's Mind can beforced; for it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of Humane Power.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Good Governours do not uſe Severity to force Men to diſſemble their Minds, and to make them Hypocrites, but to move them, after a Tryal of fair means, to greater <hi>conſideration.</hi>

                        <head>A Serious EXHORTATION, With ſome Important Advices, &amp;c. Recommended to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE offering friendly Advice and Counſel, eſpecially in great and important Caſes, is, tho often, a Thankleſs, yet a very Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Office: a thing agreeable to the beſt Inclinations of Humane Nature, and highly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the Neceſſities of Men, and conſequently needs no Apology to introduce it. We live, 'tis true, in an ill-Natured and Cenſorious Age, wherein 'tis rare to find any one, who will not take with the Left-hand, what's offered to them with the Right. But I am not diſcouraged from this Attempt, by the Peeviſhneſs and Frowardneſs of many that differ from us, Remembring that all Honeſt Undertakings (and ſuch I am ſure this is) are under the more peculiar Conduct and Bleſſing of the Divine Providence, which can and will ſucceed and proſper them to an happy Iſſue, if Mens own Obſtinacy and Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do not put a Bar in the way to hinder it. I do
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52190:717"/> therefore beſeech our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> with all the earneſtneſs that becomes a matter of ſo much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and with all the Kindneſs and Tenderneſs that becomes a Chriſtian, that they would <hi>ſuffer the VVord of Exhortation,</hi> and duely weigh and conſider the Requeſts and Advices that are here plainly laid before them, which I hope will be found ſuch, as carry their own Light and Evidence along with them.</p>
                        <div n="1" type="part">
                           <head>I.</head>
                           <p>And Firſt, <hi>We beg of them to believe, That they may be miſtaken about thoſe matters, which are alledged as the Cauſes of their Separation.</hi> This, one would think, were as needleſs, as 'tis a modeſt and reaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. For did ever any Man (the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> excepted) lay claim to Infallibility? Do not the woeful Infirmities of Humane Nature, the Weakneſs and Short-ſightedneſs of our Underſtandings, the daily Experience of our ſelves, and the lamentable Failures we obſerve in others, ſufficiently convince us, how prone we are to Error and Miſtake? But tho this be granted and owned on all hands, yet in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, we frequently find Men acting by other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. For, how many are there, that in the moſt Controverted Caſes bear up themſelves with as much Confidence and Aſſurance, cenſure others with as Magiſterial a Boldneſs, condemn the things enjoyned by our Church, with as poſitive and peremptory a Determination, as if they were infallibly ſure, that they are in the Right, and all others in the Wrong that differ from them. The early Prepoſſeſſion of a contrary Opinion, the powerful Prejudices of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, an implicite and unexamined Belief of what
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52190:718"/> their Guides and Leaders teach them, have a ſtrange force upon the Minds of Men, ſo that in effect, they no more doubt of the Truth and Goodneſs of the Cauſe they are engaged in, than they queſtion the Articles of their Creed. Wherefore, I do once and again intreat them, that laying aſide all Pride, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and Self-conceit, they would not <hi>think more highly of themſelves,</hi> and of their own way, <hi>than they ought to think;</hi> eſpecially remembering, that the Matters contended about are confeſſedly Diſputable, and that they cannot be ignorant, that the Caſe ſeems otherwiſe to others, who may at leaſt be allowed to be as wiſe Men, and as competent Judges as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Truth makes the eaſieſt Entrance into modeſt and humble Minds; <hi>The Meek will he guide in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Meek will he teach his way;</hi> The Spirit of God never reſts upon a Proud Man.</p>

                           <p>Secondly, <hi>We beg of them, that they would ſeriouſly and impartially weigh and conſider, as well what is ſaid on the one ſide, as on the other.</hi> This is a piece of Juſtice that every one owes to Truth, and which indeed every Man owes to himſelf, that is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be deceived. To take up with Prejudices, which Education or long Cuſtom have inſtilled into him, or wherein any other Arts or Methods have engaged him, without ſtrictly enquiring whether thoſe Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices ſtand upon a firm Foundation, is to ſee only on one ſide: to bind up ones ſelf in the Judgment or Opinion of any Man, that is not Divinely-inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and Infallible, or pertinaciouſly to adhere to any Party of Men; how plauſible and ſpecious ſoever their Pretences may be, without examining their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52190:719"/> Grounds, and endeavouring to know what is ſaid againſt them, is to chooſe a Perſuaſion at a perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; and 'tis great odds whether ſuch a one be in the right. In all Enquiries after Truth, we ought to keep an Ear open for one ſide of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as well as the other, and not to think we have done enough, till without Favour or Prejudice, and to the beſt of our Underſtandings, we have heard, tryed, and judged, the Reaſons brought, as well for, as againſt it. And till this be done, I ſee not with what pretence of Reaſon, Men can talk ſo much of their <hi>Scruples,</hi> or plead for Favour on the account of their Diſſatisfactions. Conſciences truly tender, are willing and deſirous to embrace all opportunities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, &amp; are ready to kiſs the Hand that would bring them better information, and are not wont to neglect, much leſs thruſt from them the means that might eaſe them of their Doubts and Scruples. We juſtly blame it in them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in a manner they reſign up their Underſtandings to their Guides and Confeſſors, and are not ſuffered to be truly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principles, and the Grounds and Reaſons of the Reformation; nor to Read any of the Books, that are written for their Conviction, without a ſpecial and peculiar Licence. Whether our Brethren of the Separation be under any ſuch Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſcipline, I know not; ſure I am it looks very odly, that ſo many of them are no more concerned to underſtand the true State of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Nature and Reaſons of her Conſtitutions, that ſo few of them care to Confer with thoſe that are able to Inſtruct them, but Cry out, <hi>They are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied already;</hi> nay, ſome of them, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when deſired to propoſe their Scruples, in order to the giving them ſatisfaction, have plainly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52190:720"/> refuſed to do it. Little reaſon there is to believe, that ſuch Perſons have ever Read and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined what the Church of <hi>England</hi> has to ſay for her ſelf. Are there not many, that not only Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but Rail at the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> that yet never heard it, nor perhaps, ever read it, in all their Lives? And if this be not to ſpeak Evil of what they know not, I cannot tell what is. How many incomparable Books have been heretofore written in defence of our <hi>Church,</hi> her Rites and Uſages, that yet generally lie by the Walls, little known, and leſs read, by thoſe that ſo much Cry out againſt her. And at this time how many excellent Diſcourſes have been Publiſhed, for the ſatisfaction of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the greateſt Temper and Moderation; with the utmoſt plainneſs and perſpicuity, with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable evidence and ſtrength of Reaſoning; ſo ſhort, as not to require any conſiderable portion, either of Time or Coſt, ſo ſuited to preſent Circumſtances, as to obviate every material Objection, that is made againſt Communion with us; and yet there is juſt cauſe to fear, that the far greateſt part of our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> are meer ſtrangers to them, and are not ſo juſt to themſelves, or us, as to give them the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And that thoſe few that do look into them, do it rather out of a deſign to pick quarrels againſt them, and to expoſe them in ſcurrilous or cavilling Pamphlets, than to receive ſatisfaction by them. I do heartily, and from my Soul, wiſh an end of theſe Contentions, and that there were no further occaſion for them; but if our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> will ſtill proceed in this way, we deſire, (and hope 'tis but what is reaſonable) that the things in difference may be debated in the moſt quiet, peaceable, and amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, that they may be gravely and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52190:721"/> managed, and only the Merits of the Cauſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and that the Controverſie may not be turned off to mean and trifling Perſons, whoſe higheſt Attainment perhaps it is, to write an idle and ſenſeleſs Pamphlet, and which can ſerve no other uſe, but only that the People may be borne in hand, that ſuch and ſuch Books are Anſwered. Which is ſo unmanly and diſingenious a way, and ſo like the ſhifting Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I am apt to perſuade my ſelf, the wiſer Heads of the <hi>Diſſenting Party</hi> cannot but be aſhamed of it. If they be not, 'tis plain to all the World, they are willing to ſerve an ill Deſign by the moſt unwarrantable Means. But however that be, we think we have great Reaſon to expect from them, that they ſhould hear our <hi>Church</hi> before they condemn Her, and conſider what has been ſaid for the removing of their Doubts, before they tell us any more of <hi>Scruples, Tender-Conſciences,</hi> and the hard meaſure that they meet withall. I confeſs, could I meet with a Perſon that had brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome kind of Unbyas'dneſs and indifferency of Temper, and that deſign'd nothing more than to ſeek and find the right way of Serving God, without reſpect to the Intrigues and Intereſts of this or that particular Party; and in order thereunto, had with a ſincere and honeſt Mind read whatever might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conduce to his Satisfaction, fairly propoſed his Scruples, and modeſtly conſulted with thoſe that were moſt proper to adviſe him, and humbly begged the Guidance and Direction of the Divine Grace and Bleſſing; and yet after all, ſhould ſtill labour under his old Diſſatisfactions; I ſhould heartily pity and pray for ſuch a Man, and think my ſelf obliged to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all my Intereſt for Favour and Forbearance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. But ſuch Perſons as theſe, I am afraid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52190:721"/> are but thin ſowed; and, without Breach of Charity, it may be ſuppoſed, there is not One of a Thouſand.</p>

                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>We deſire, that before they go on to accuſe our Church with driving them into Separation, they would directly charge her with impoſing ſinful terms of Communion.</hi> And unleſs they do this, and when they have done it, make it good, (for barely to accuſe, I hope, is not ſufficient,) I ſee not which way they can poſſibly juſtifie their Separation from us. 'Tis upon this account that the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation defends their Departure from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They found the Doctrine of that Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely corrupt in ſeveral of the main Principles of Religion, New Articles of Faith introduced, and bound upon the Conſciences of Men under pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its Worſhip overgrown with very groſs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition; its Rites and Ceremonies not only over-numerous, but many of them advanced into proper and direct Acts of Worſhip, and the uſe of them made neceſſary to Salvation; and beſides, its Members required to joyn and communicate in theſe Corruptions and Depravations, nay, and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals and Attempts towards a Reformation obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected and thrown out; in which Caſe, they did with great Reaſon and Juſtice depart from her: which we may be confident they would not have done, had no more been required of them, than inſtead of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Images, to uſe the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or inſtead of the Adoration of the Hoſt, to <hi>kneel</hi> at the Receiving of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> A Learned <note place="margin">Amyrald. <hi>de Seceſſ. ab Eccleſ.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52190:722"/> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> beſides their uſeleſs Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Baptiſme, and ſome other things that are beyond the meaſure and <hi>genius</hi> of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they had ſtill continued in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Church.</q> Indeed did the Church of <hi>England</hi> command any thing which Chriſt has prohibited, or prohibit any thing which Chriſt has commanded, then <hi>come ye out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord,</hi> were good Warrant and Authority. But where do we meet with theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions? not in the word of God, not in the nature and reaſon of the things themſelves? nor indeed do we find our Diſſenting Brethren of late very forward to faſten this charge, and much leſs to prove it; whatever unwary ſayings may fall from any of them in the heat and warmth of Diſputation, or be ſuggeſted by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect conſequences, and artificial inſinuations. And if our Church commands nothing that renders her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſinful, then certainly Separation from her muſt be unlawful, becauſe the Peace and Unity of the Church, and obedience to the commands of lawful Authority, are expreſs and indiſpenſable duties; and a few private ſuſpicions of the unlawfulneſs of the thing are not ſufficient to ſway againſt plain, publick, and neceſſary Duties: nor can it be ſafe to reject Communicating with thoſe, with whom Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf does not refuſe Communion. <q>This I am ſure was once thought good Doctrine by the chiefeſt of our Diſſenters, who when time was, reaſoned thus againſt thoſe that ſubdivided from them; If we be a Church of Chriſt, and Chriſt hold Communion with <note place="margin">

                              <q>And in the ſame Book they tell us of a Two-fold Schiſm, Negative and Poſitive; Negative, when Men do peaceably and quietly withdraw from Communion with a Church, not making a Head againſt that Church, from which they are depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the other is, when Perſons ſo withdrawing do conſociate and withdraw themſelves into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and oppoſite Body, ſetting up a Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Church, which (ſay they) <hi>Camero</hi> calls a Schiſm by way of Eminency; and further tells us, There are Four Cauſes, that make a Separation from a Church lawful; 1. When they that Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are grievouſly and intollerably Perſecuted; 2. When the Church they Separate from is Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; 3. When it is Idolatrous; 4. When it is the Seat of Antichriſt. And where none of theſe four are found, there the Separation is inſufficient, and Schiſm. Now we are fully aſſured, that none of theſe Four Cauſes can be juſtly charg'd upon our Congregations; therefore you muſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with us, but with your ſelves, if we blame you as guilty of poſitive Schiſm.</q> All which is as

And there is the more Reaſon to put Men upon this Enquiry, not only becauſe Secular Ends are very apt to mix with, and ſhelter themſelves under the ſhadow of Religion; but becauſe this has been an old Artifice, made uſe of to promote Separation. Thus the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in the Primitive Times upheld their Separation from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church, and kept their Party faſt together, by Trading only within themſelves, by imploying none to Till their Grounds, or be their Stewards, but thoſe that would be of their ſide; nay, and ſometimes hiring Perſons by large Sums of Money to be Baptiz'd into their Party, as <hi>Criſpin</hi> did the People of <hi>Mappalia.</hi> And how evident the ſame Policy is among our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <note place="margin">

                           <p>And Firſt, We deſire them to produce any ſettled part of the Chriſtian Church, that ever was without Epiſcopal Government, till the time of <hi>Calvin:</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then as hard to find any part of the Chriſtian World without a Church, as to find a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop. This is ſo evident in the moſt early An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of the Church, that I believe our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> begin to grow ſick of the Controverſie. And if <hi>Blondell, Salmaſius</hi> and <hi>Daille,</hi> (whoſe great Parts, Learning, and indefatigable Induſtry, could, if any thing, have made out the contrary) have been forced to grant, That <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> obtained in the Church within a few Years after the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Age; We are ſure we can carry it higher, even up to the Apoſtles themſelves. There are but two paſſages,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52190:725"/> that I know of, in all Antiquity, of any Note, and both of them not till the latter end of the <hi>Fourth Century,</hi> that may ſeem to queſtion <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: The One, That famous and well known paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> which yet when improved to the <note place="margin">

And very clear it is to thoſe that are acquainted with St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> Writings, that he often Wrote in haſte, and did not always weigh things at the Beam, and forgot at one time, what he had ſaid at another; that many expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fell from him in the heat of Diſputation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the warmth and the eagerneſs of his Temper, &amp; that he was particularly chaſed into this Aſſertion by the fierce oppoſition of the <hi>Deacons</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Uſurp upon, and over-top the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which tempted him to Magnifie and Extol their Place and Dignity, as anciently equal to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Office, and as containing in it the common Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Prieſthood. For at other times, when he Wrote with cooler Thoughts about him, he does plainly and frequently enough aſſert the Authority of Biſhops over Presbyters, and did himſelf conſtantly live in Communion with, and Subjection to Biſhops. The other paſſage is that of <hi>Aerius,</hi> who held indeed that a Biſhop and a Presbyter differed nothing in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Dignity, or Power. But he was led into this Error meerly through Envy and Emulation, being vext to ſee that his Companion <hi>Euſtathius</hi> had gotten the Biſhoprick of <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> which himſelf had aimed at. This made him ſtart aſide, and talk extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the Church immediately branded him for an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and drave him and his followers out of all Churches, and from all Cities and Villages. And <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi>

Sixthly, That all ſuch who have been deceived and drawn away, under pretence of greater Purity, Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have any Fear and Awe of God and his Word, be Exhorted to leave and forſake them, and return to the Publick Aſſemblies and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this and other Reformed Churches.

                           <p>Eighthly, <hi>We deſire it may be conſidered, what plain and apparent Advantages Separation gives to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy of the Proteſtant Religion in theſe Nations:</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> is notoriouſly known to have been the moſt ſtrong and ſtanding Bulwark of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation; for being Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Scripture-grounds, and the Practice of True, Genuine, Primitive Antiquity, and having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by the moſt wiſe, regular, and juſtifiable Methods; it ſtands like a Rock impregnable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Aſſaults, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes upon it. This has engag'd them to Plant all their Batteries to beat it down, as being the only Church conſiderable enough to ſtand in their way: and when not able to effect it by any other Arts, they have betaken themſelves to the old Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Ruining us, by dividing us. In Order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they have upon all occaſions ſtrenuouſly promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Separation, mixed themſelves with our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, put on every ſhape, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter follow the Common outcry againſt our Church, as <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> ſpurring on the people to call for a more pure and ſpiritual way of worſhip, and to Clamour for liberty and Toleration, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they well knew they themſelves were like to have the greateſt ſhare; and that having ſubverted all Order, and beaten people out of all ſober Principles, they foreſaw they muſt be neceſſitated at laſt to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Communion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. This was a Trade they began betimes, almoſt in the very Infancy of the Reformation. Witneſs the Story of <hi>Faithful Commin,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryer, who paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a Zealous Puritan, and was much
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52190:732"/> admired and followed by the People for his ſeeming Piety, ſpiritual Gifts, and Zeal againſt Popery. But being apprehended, <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. and accuſed for an Impoſtor, was examined at large before the Queen and her Council, and put under Bail: when finding the Climat was like to be too hot for him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by a cheat brought off his Bail, and told his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded followers, that he was acquitted by her Majeſty and the Council, and warned of God to go beyond the Seas, to inſtruct the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there, and that he would come again; and having aſſured them that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Prayer was the chief Teſtimony of a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, and that the ſet Form of Prayer in <hi>England</hi> was but the <hi>Maſs</hi> Tranſlated, and having, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>extempore-Prayers</hi> and Tears ſqueezed out of them a Collection of a Hundred and Thirty Pounds for his Journey, beſides private Gifts; away he goes for <hi>Rome,</hi> and acquaints Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> with what he had done, and by what Methods, and how odious he had made the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and that it would be a ſtumbling-block to that Church while it was a Church.

                           <p>Ninthly, <hi>We deſire of them, that if neither theſe nor any other Advices and Conſiderations can prevail with them, they would at least ceaſe to Reproach the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Reviving the Execution of the Laws, about theſe matters?</hi> I know it is very natural to Men to complain, when any thing pinches them, but then they ought to be ſo juſt, as to conſider, whoſe fault
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52190:734"/> it is that has brought it upon them. The Laws in this caſe were framed with great Advice, and upon dear bought Experience, and every Nation in the World thinks it ſelf obliged, when no other ways will do it, by Penalties to ſecure the Publick Peace, Safety, and Tranquility of the State, though it may ſometimes preſs hard in ſome particular Caſes, when Men through Fancy, Humour, Miſtake or Deſign, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about little, and as themſelves confeſs, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent matters,) ſhall endanger the Publick Welfare, and by an ill Example expoſe the Reverence and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Laws. And yet notwithſtanding all this, and a great deal more that might be ſaid, we find them at every turn charging the Government, for uſing them Cruelly, and with the hardeſt Meaſure, cenſuring their Superiours, and <hi>ſpeaking Evil of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;</hi> and this not only the Cry of the mean and common Sort, but of their chiefeſt Leaders, even to this Hour: It being no hard matter (but that I love not to exaſperate) to inſtance in ſeveral things, that are no very good Arguments of that <hi>Obedient Patience,</hi> which ſome of them ſo much pretend to. It is far from my Temper to delight in Cruelty, much more to plead for Severity to be uſed towards <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren,</hi> and therefore ſhould have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Argument, were it not neceſſary to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Government, which upon theſe occaſions, I have ſo often heard Blamed and Cenſured. I would theſe Perſons who complain ſo much, would conſider a while, how their Predeceſſors were dealt with in the times of the <hi>good Queen Elizabeth;</hi> which will appear, either from the Laws then made, or from the Proceedings then had againſt them. The Laws then made againſt them, were chiefly theſe; In the Firſt of the Queen, <hi>An Act for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of</hi>

For albeit the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> do impoiſon the Hearts of Her Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, under a Pretext of Conſcience, to withdraw them from their Obedience due to her Majeſty, yet do the ſame but cloſely, and only in privy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but theſe Men do both Publiſh in their Printed Books, and Teach in all their Conventicles ſundry Opinions, not only dangerous to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled Eſtate and Policy of the Realm, but alſo much derogatory to Her Sacred Majeſty, and Her Crown, as well by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all which Things (however in many other Points, they pretend to be at War with the Popiſh <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> yet by the Separation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Unity of their Fellow-Subjects, and by abuſing the Sacred Authority and Majeſty of their Prince, they do both joyn and concur with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in opening the Door, and preparing the way
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52190:737"/> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion, that is Threatned againſt the Realm.</q> Thus far he, <hi>by her Majeſties moſt Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pleaſure, and Wiſe Direction,</hi> as he there ſpeaks. To which let me add, That the Speech took ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the Parliament paſſed the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>35th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Severeſt Act againſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in the whole Body of our Laws. And indeed, ſo Jealous was the Queen of the leaſt appearances of Innovation, that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Grindall,</hi> only for giving too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to <hi>Propheſyings</hi> (which were beheld as likely to prove Nurſeries of Schiſm and Faction, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they did) fell under Her Diſpleaſure, and was Sequeſtred from his Archiepiſcopal Juriſdiction, and though great interceſſion was made in his behalf, yet could he never be reſtored to his Dying Day.</p>
                           <p>This was the State of things then, and yet theſe were the Proceedings of thoſe Days, which our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> at another time, are wont ſo much to Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and Extol; nothing of late having been ſo much in their Mouth, as the Wiſdom and Prudence, the Care and Diligence, the Zeal and Piety of <hi>Good Queen Elizabeth.</hi> I ſpeak not this to caſt any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon the Memory of that incomparable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, whom we have all the reaſon in the World to own to have been the Glorious Inſtrument of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and Setling the Reformation in this Kingdom; and whoſe Memory will be dear and pretious, as long as the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Name has a Being in <hi>England.</hi> But I only take notice, how extreamly partial People are, and how apt to be prejudiced againſt the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live, and to be always Crying out, That <hi>the former Days were better then theſe?</hi> whereas, ſuppoſing their Circumſtances were really harder than they are, and harder then thoſe of the <hi>Puritans</hi> in former times, yet they have no reaſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52190:737"/> to accuſe the Government of Rigor and Severity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, if three Things be farther taken into Conſideration.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of old, eſpecially the firſt Race of them, were generally much more Modeſt and Peaceable then thoſe of latter times, more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Laws, leſs Turbulent and Offenſive to the Government: when they could not Conform as Miniſters, they yet did as private Chriſtians, and quietly acquieſced in their Suſpenſion, or Deprivation, and as one truly ſays of them, <hi>When they could not be Active without Sinning,</hi> [as they judged] <hi>they could be paſſive without Murmuring.</hi> They medled not with things without their Line, nor mixt themſelves with matters of State; Declared, that Kings have <note place="margin">

They generally came to Church, and did not run into Separate Congregations, nay, writ ſtoutly and ſmartly againſt thoſe who began then to attempt a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. But whether our Modern <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have obſerved the ſame Courſe, and be of this Spirit and Temper, let the World judge, yea, let themſelves be Judges in the Caſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sad Experience of the Evil Conſequences of Schiſm and Separation, have made it neceſſary for the Government to take all juſt and lawful ways for preventing the like for the time to come. Men firſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52190:738"/> began to be diſſatisfied with the Rites and Orders of the Church, then diſcontented that they were not preſently gratified with an Alteration, Diſcontent brought on Sedition, Sedition Rebellion, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion the Ruine of Church and State. And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the Laws bear a little hard there, where there are the ſame Appearances, and where there ſeem to be the ſame Tendencies and Inclinations to the ſame Diſmal State of Things? Whoever conſiders by what Ways the moſt flouriſhing Kingdom in the World, and the beſt Church that ever was ſince the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times, were miſerably Harraſſed and Deſtroyed, cannot think, that thoſe who ſit at the Helm ſhould be content to have them Ruined again by the ſame means; eſpecially, after the King, for ſeveral Years together, has in vain tryed, by all the Methods of Favour and Indulgence, to win upon them.</p>

Then I <hi>ſuffer as a Chriſtian,</hi> when the Honour of Chriſt, or ſomething that offers Violence to my Religion, and Chriſtianity is concerned in it, when I ſuffer for that which I cannot avoid, without diſowning my ſelf to be a Chriſtian, and <hi>making Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Faith and a good Conſcience.</hi> But where the Caſe is not evidently this, a Man may draw Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries upon himſelf, and yet not <hi>ſuffer as a Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe it may proceed from Humour, or Intereſt, or the Conduct of a miſinformed Judgment, miſtaking things for what they are not: Men very often place Religion in doing, or not doing, what is no part of it, and then think they may ſafely Suffer upon that account, when there is more, it may be, of Paſſion or Prejudice, of Fancy or Opinion, of Humour or Miſtake, then of the real Concerns of Piety or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I am very ſure, neither the Ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, would have paſſed through the <hi>Fiery-Tryal</hi> every Day, nor the Holy Martyrs in <hi>Queen Mary</hi>'s Days, have thought themſelves obliged to Forfeit their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, much leſs their Lives, had no more been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them then there is of us, to come to Khurch, or to Kneel at the Sacrament; but would rather have Bleſſed God, and thankfully owned the Favour of the Governours, under which they lived, might they have enjoyed both upon the ſame Terms as we do. In Caſes that only concern indifferent things, and meer Circumſtances of Worſhip, ſtiffly and obſtinately to ſtand out, is, rather for a Man to be a Martyr to his own Humour and Opinion, then to the Cauſe of Chriſt.

                           <p>All that now remains, is, to call upon our <hi>Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Brethren,</hi> by all the Conſiderations of Love and Kindneſs to themſelves, of Tenderneſs for the Honour of Religion, the Edification of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> and the Peace, Security, and Welfare of the Church and State wherein they live, that they would duely and impartially Weigh and Conſider things, put a ſtop to the Separation wherein they are engaged, return to, and hold Communion with us, and <hi>keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi>

Let us conſider a little, what a deep Senſe the beſt and moſt pious Chriſtians that ever were, had of it: <hi>It's better to Suffer any thing, than that the Church of God ſhould be Rent aſunder; it is every whit as Glorious, and, in my Opinion, a far greater Martyrdom, to dye for not Dividing the Church, than for refuſing to Sacrifice to Idols,</hi> ſays <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the good Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Novatian.</hi>

                              <q>And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks very ſevere things to this purpoſe, That a Perſon going from the Church to Schiſmaticks, tho in that Capacity he ſhould dye for Chriſt, yet can he not receive the Crown of Martyrdom.</q> 
                              <q>And how oft elſewhere doth he tell us, That ſuch a one has no part in the Law of God, or the Faith of Chriſt, or in Life and Salvation; that without this Unity and Charity, a Man <hi>cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and that although he ſhould deliver up himſelf to the Flames, or caſt his Body to wild Beaſts, yet this would not be the Crown of his Faith, but the Puniſhment of his Falſhood, not the Glorious <hi>Exit</hi> of a Religious Courage, but the Iſſue of Deſpair; ſuch a One may be Kill'd, but he cannot be Crown'd.

And can we now be ſuch degenerate Chriſtians, (if we can be ſaid to be Chriſtians at all) as to make nothing at all of Schiſm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? Are not the Glory of God, the Peace of the Church, and the Good of Souls, things as conſiderable, as neceſſary, and indiſpenſable now, as they were of old?
